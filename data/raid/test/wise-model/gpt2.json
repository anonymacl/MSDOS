    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type. This\ndevelops work of Uhlenbeck, Segal, and Burstall-Guest to non-compact inner\nsymmetric spaces. To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity. This provides a straightforward way to construct all such harmonic\nmaps.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",
    "Deep neural networks have achieved satisfactory performance in piles of\nmedical image analysis tasks. However the training of deep neural network\nrequires a large amount of samples with high-quality annotations. In medical\nimage segmentation, it is very laborious and expensive to acquire precise\npixel-level annotations. Aiming at training deep segmentation models on\ndatasets with probably corrupted annotations, we propose a novel Meta Corrupted\nPixels Mining (MCPM) method based on a simple meta mask network. Our method is\ntargeted at automatically estimate a weighting map to evaluate the importance\nof every pixel in the learning of segmentation network. The meta mask network\nwhich regards the loss value map of the predicted segmentation results as\ninput, is capable of identifying out corrupted layers and allocating small\nweights to them. An alternative algorithm is adopted to train the segmentation\nnetwork and the meta mask network, simultaneously. Extensive experimental\nresults on LIDC-IDRI and LiTS datasets show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches which are devised for coping with corrupted\nannotations.",

    "  It is an important task to faithfully evaluate the perceptual quality of\noutput images in many applications such as image compression, image restoration\nand multimedia streaming. A good image quality assessment (IQA) model should\nnot only deliver high quality prediction accuracy but also be computationally\nefficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is becoming particularly important due\nto the increasing proliferation of high-volume visual data in high-speed\nnetworks. We present a new effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient\nmagnitude similarity deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to\nimage distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image suffer\ndifferent degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of\nglobal variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality\nprediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS)\nbetween the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling\nstrategy the standard deviation of the GMS map can predict accurately\nperceptual image quality.

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic. Edges are constructed by\ndividing image into different catchment basins with the help of a membership\nfunction. Finally closed contour algorithm is applied to find closed regions\nand objects within closed regions are segmented using intensity information.\nThe performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both objectively as well\nas subjectively.

For comparative analysis, various comparison\nmethods are used for demonstrating the superiority of proposed methods over\nexisting segmentation methods.",
    "  The effects of residual amplitude modulation (RAM) in laser interferometers\nusing heterodyne sensing can be substantial and difficult to mitigate. In this\nwork, we analyze the effects of RAM on a complex laser interferometer used for\ngravitational wave detection.

This shift causes variations in\nthe sensing matrix, and leads to degradation in the performance of the\nprecision noise subtraction scheme of the multiple-degree-of-freedom control\nsystem. In addition, such detuned optical cavities produce an opto-mechanical\nspring, which also varies the sensing matrix.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

To efficiently process video, we propose 3D separable\nconvolution for the pyramid pooling module and decoder, which dramatically\nreduces the number of operations while maintaining the performance. Moreover,\nwe also extend our framework to video action segmentation by adding an extra\nclassifier to predict the action label for actors in videos.

Our generative\nadversarial network based model works on a conditional probability approach.\nThis approach makes the image translation independent of any local, global and\ncontent or style features. In our approach we use a bidirectional\nreconstruction model appended with the affine transform factor that helps in\nconserving the content and photorealism as compared to other models. The\nadvantage of using such an approach is that the image-to-image translation is\nsemi-supervised, independant of image segmentation and inherits the properties\nof generative adversarial networks tending to produce realistic. This method\nhas proven to produce better results than Multimodal Unsupervised\nImage-to-image translation.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also\noutperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and\nachieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).",
    "Current state-of-the-art methods for image segmentation form a dense image\nrepresentation where the color, shape and texture information are all processed\ntogether inside a deep CNN. This however may not be ideal as they contain very\ndifferent type of information relevant for recognition. Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark, in terms of both mask\n(mIoU) and boundary (F-score) quality, improving by 2% and 4% over strong\nbaselines.",
    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions. Our proof confirms recent numerical findings that already\nhinted at this convergence. Furthermore we offer a thorough mathematical\nunderpinning for networks of so-called theta neurons, where the OA ansatz has\njust been applied. In a final step we extend our proof by allowing for\ntime-dependent and multi-dimensional parameters as well as for network\ntopologies other than global coupling. This renders the OA ansatz an excellent\nstarting point for the analysis of a broad class of realistic settings.\n",
    "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the non-invasive modality of choice for\nbody tissue composition analysis due to its excellent soft tissue contrast and\nlack of ionizing radiation.

When she thinks her two children do not need her any longer, Lila Schwartz, a sexually active woman, leaves behind her family, calls herself Lila Munroe and moves to California, where she trains, and later works, as a lawyer. Faced with the dual challenge of having to raise two teenage kids while remaining successful in his demanding job as a publicist and speech writer, Bernard Schwartz more and more relies on medication to cope with everyday life. The real trouble begins when he accidentally swallows two incompatible antidepressants and falls into a coma shortly thereafter. While he is unconscious Bernard Schwartz has a stroke. When he wakes up again he is seriously handicapped&mdash;his speech is slurred, his walk is unsteady and his memory is permanently impaired. Similar to a child, he has to learn the meanings of many words. Instead of going to school, Chris teaches his father as best as he can. In spite of his enforced preoccupation with his \"sleeping\" father, Chris Schwartz notices that his own life goes on without any major change. Still a virgin, he fantasizes about having sex with Lisa Danmeyer, Bernard's neurologist and actually has his first sexual encounter ever at his father's rehab centre with a sexy speech pathologist who performs fellatio on him. At the same time Cathy, his 16 year-old sister, is on the brink of abandoning her Jewish roots and converting to Roman Catholicism. However, she also develops a crush on Francis Dial, her brother's best friend and classmate. Chris cannot believe that his younger sister might have sex before he does, but in the end this is exactly what happens, an unwanted teenage pregnancy being the result of their union. At first the young lovers are unsure whether Cathy should have an abortion or not, but Cathy soon makes up her mind to keep the baby.",
    " The school has been run since its inception ten years earlier by two elderly educators, Mabel Edge and Hermione Baker, who are regarded by many as old spinsters hopelessly out of touch with reality, especially with what their teenage charges really think and feel. The 300 or so students are virtually indistinguishable from one another, a fact which is stressed by their names all starting with the letter M: Margot, Marion, Mary, Melissa, Merode, Midget, Mirabel, Moira. Their budding but suppressed sexuality&mdash;they are all between 16 and 18 years of age and \"going to be attractive\"&mdash;is constantly alluded to in the novel. (\"They're only children, the girls I mean, and sex is unconscious at their age. It's such a temptation for a man.\") Of the teaching staff, only few characters are mentioned. There is Miss Winstanley, young, colourless, and secretly in love with one of the few male teachers at the academy, economics tutor Sebastian Birt. Birt, however, a short and stout man in his late twenties, is having an affair with Elizabeth Rock, a 35 year-old woman recovering from a nervous breakdown who temporarily also lives on the school grounds, in her grandfather's cottage. That man, 76 year-old Mr Rock, is a retired scientist who has been granted the privilege to live there for the remainder of his life for past services rendered to the State. The aging Rock, who is referred to as \"the sage\" by some (including the narrator) and as \"Gapa\" by his granddaughter, spends his time mainly with, and for, his pets&mdash;his albino sow, Daisy, his cat, Alice, and his goose, Ted. He describes himself as \"a bit stiff about the joints these days\", he has some difficulty climbing steps, has poor eyesight, is deaf in one ear and almost deaf in the other, and has recently had problems with his memory. In addition, one of his idiosyncrasies consists in putting all the post he gets in a big trunk without opening any of it, ever. Edge, one of the principals, has for some time wanted to thoroughly \"spring-clean\" the whole place and get rid of Rock, his granddaughter, and Birt, partly in order to secure the sage's cottage for the use of additional school staff. In other matters, she is more hesitant. When in the morning some girls report Mary and Merode missing, pointing out that neither of their beds has been slept in, Edge turns out to be very reluctant to use the official channels to inform relatives, the school supervisor, or the local police. Naturally it occurs to her and her colleague Baker that Mary and Merode might have eloped with two young men (\"At the station much of their time was taken up with young women adrift, who, after fourteen days, returned brown and happy from a fortnight with a boy by the ocean.\"), but, rather than fearing the worst, they assume the girls will be back for that night's entertainment, a ball in honour of the academy's founder&mdash;without men of course. At the same time Edge turns down some of the staff's requests to be allowed to go swimming in the nearby lake, which is interpreted as a sure sign that one of the girls' bodies could turn up any time floating in the water. In the course of the day, especially where Rock is involved, lots of people talk at cross-purposes, deliberately as well as accidentally misunderstanding what others are saying, in many instances only hinting at facts or, worse, spreading rumours. Around noon Merode is found, right on the compound but somewhat dazed, under a fallen beech in the vicinity of Rock's cottage&mdash;the very beech tree used by Sebastian Birt and Elizabeth Rock when they want to have some fun. According to school regulations, Merode must not be interrogated before she has submitted a written statement about what has happened, and she is immediately locked away for her own good. The rest of the afternoon is mainly taken up with preparations for the dance. As usual, the Founder's Day Ball is held without any guests from outside the school. However, Rock and his granddaughter turn up unexpectedly but appropriately dressed, without having been invited by anyone. While Mary is still missing (the reader never learns where she is or what has happened to her), Elizabeth Rock and Sebastian Birt start dancing together cheek to cheek and, generally, appear glued to each other, a \"display of animalism\" Edge is not willing to put up with any longer. Almost at the end of her tether, she secretly indulges in a cigarette or two in her office. Meanwhile Mr Rock is accosted by several of the girls who first want to dance with him and later drag him downstairs into the cellar of the building where they take turns kissing him and where they introduce him to the \"Institute Inn\", their secret club. Although Rock initially enjoys the girls' attentions, he quickly becomes appalled by their lack of morals and leaves the \"club.\" He comes upon his nemesis, Miss Edge, but after his experiences with the girls he is more sympathetic to her difficulties maintaining order at the school. For her part, Edge is impressed with the courtly bearing Rock has affected in the Ball's formal setting and also consumed by a tobacco-fueled lassitude. The two older adults have a pleasant conversation which comes to a head when Edge, almost without realizing, finds herself proposing marriage to Rock. The sage is astounded, and politely but firmly rejects her suggestion. He then leaves the ball and returns home to his animals. At the end of the day no one has reached any conclusions, and everything remains undecided.",

The principal claims that she did this to ensure they were wearing proper attire for the school dance. She also claims that her job is not only to ensure they get a proper education, but that they also grow into proper ladies and do not become sluts. She sends several girls home for wearing slutty panties. Although there is no crime to charge her with, Jesse determines to make trouble for her until he can find something to charge her with as he is convinced the girls’ civil rights were violated. He begins interviewing the principal along with her high powered attorney husband, as well as the girls. Later one of the girls comes to see Jesse at his office. She tells him that her parents are swingers, and often host parties for that purpose at their home. She and her little brother hate it and she asks Jesse if he can help. With swinging not illegal, Jesse finds his hands tied, but decides to investigate anyway. He has Suit talk to two of the women, one of whom he knew in high school, to get more information on the swingers club. Suit discovers that the girl’s mother is not into it, but only does it because her husband wants to. Jesse has Spike threaten her husband about the swinging, and she later leaves him. The main plot of the novel involves the investigation of the Night Hawk. The Night Hawk starts as a peeping tom, and the Paradise police get several calls about him. Later the Night Hawk escalates his voyeuristic attacks by breaking into homes while women are home alone, forcing them to undress at gunpoint, and then taking nude photos of them. He then begins writing Jesse detailing his exploits, and includes the nude photos. He writes that he cannot stop himself; he must discover these women’s “secret.” He also writes that he does not know what he will do next and fears that he will escalate further. Jesse begins to combine his investigation of the swingers with his investigation of the Night Hawk. Since the Night Hawk never touches anyone, he questions the swingers to find out if there is anyone in their club that only likes to watch and never touch. The women in the club all identify Seth Ralston. Ralston is a professor of English at a nearby university. He is married to a young grad student who is working on her doctorate. Jesse discovers that Ralston's wife used to teach a Wednesday night class, which corresponds with all the peeping tom reports. He also discovers that the peeping tom reports stopped at the same time that Ralston’s wife quit her teaching job to begin doing her doctoral work full time. Jesse questions Ralston’s wife about the swinging to see if she will inadvertently reveal something about her husband that will confirm he is the Night Hawk, and even hints to her that her husband may be the Night Hawk. She responds by belittling Jesse for being a dumb cop, and singling them out for their lifestyle. Meanwhile Jesse continues to pressure Betsy Ingersoll, who then reports that she is a victim of the Night Hawk. Soon after Jesse receives a nude photo of Betsy, however he and Molly become convinced that she is posing in the photo and suspect the attack was staged. The local media request an interview concerning the attack, and Jesse uncharacteristically agrees. He gives details of the attack and later receives a letter from the Night Hawk who demands that he never attacked Betsy Ingersoll. Jesse believes that the Night Hawk is telling the truth, as he has never denied an attack before, but always been honest about his attacks. Jesse confronts Betsy with this and she admits that she staged the attack. She says that she did it to get some attention from her husband, but that he did not even care. She was acting out because her husband cheats on her constantly with young women, which also explains her obsession with teenage girls not growing up to be sluts. Jesse agrees not to charge her with any crimes if she agrees to see Sunny Randall’s shrink, Dr. Silverman (the long-term love interest of another Parker character Spenser), which she does. A few days later Seth Ralston’s wife comes to Jesse to report that her husband is missing. They begin searching for him, and soon after Jesse receives another letter from the Night Hawk blasting him for speaking with his wife, and ruining his life. He writes that he is going to leave town, but only after he discovers one more woman’s secret, as he calls it, and warns that this woman will be someone close to Jesse. Jesse thinks that he is trying to hint that the woman will be Betsy Ingersoll, but Jesse believes he is actually targeting Molly. They set a police unit in front of Betsy’s house as a decoy, but then stake out Molly’s house. Molly waits at home with a gun strapped to her thigh, and a wire so Jesse can hear her. The Night Hawk breaks in on her and forces her to begin stripping at gun point. Suit and Jesse then break in to arrest him. Surprised that they figured out he was after Molly, he raises his gun to shoot her, but Molly, Suit, and Jesse all shoot and kill Seth Ralston, putting an end to the Night Hawk. Suit is left with a moral dilemma that it was his shot that killed Ralston, but since all three fired, Jesse is able to disfuse the situation by convincing Suit that it could have been any one of the three.",
    " The story outlines contact between Earth and the title Visitors, a group of mysterious objects from deep space. The Visitors are simple black oblong boxes, as large as buildings, which approach from space and orbit the Earth before descending to the United States. The nature of the visitors is kept rather mysterious&nbsp;— it's not clear if they are vehicles or living things in their own right. They are apparently unable to communicate with humans in any meaningful way; on one occasion a human is taken inside a Visitor, only to be released after experiencing a jumble of confusing colored lights and smells which he didn't understand. The Visitors are composed largely of a dense form of cellulose, and they proceed to consume a quantity of trees and plant life in the US. Eventually they start producing vehicles, superficially resembling human cars but capable of flying using the same unknown principles as the Visitors themselves, and apparently incorporating some element of intelligence, or at least instinct, since they do not crash into things as they move. The humans assume that the Visitors have created these vehicles as a gift in return for the plant matter which the Visitors are consuming, and the novel touches on the disruption such well-meaning gifts might incur on the Earth's economic systems. Toward the end of the book the Visitors also start producing housing units for humans, and it is even implied that something living may be inside them&nbsp;— perhaps even a Visitor-produced version of humans themselves.",
    " The Republic is decaying, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was elected to save the galaxy from collapsing under the forces of discontent. On the tiny but strategic planet of Ansion, a powerful faction is on the verge of joining the growing Separatist movement. The urban dwellers wish to expand into the prairies outside their cities - the ancestral territory of the fierce, independent Ansion nomads. If their demands are not met, they will secede - an act that could jump-start a chain reaction of withdrawal and rebellion by other worlds of the Republic. At the Chancellor's request, the Jedi Council sends Kenobi and fellow Jedi Luminara Unduli to resolve the conflict and negotiate with the elusive nomads. Undaunted, Kenobi and Unduli, along with their Padawans Skywalker and Barriss Offee, set out across the wilderness. Many perils lie waiting to trap them. The Jedi will have to fulfill near-impossible tasks, befriend wary strangers, and influence two great armies to complete their quest, stalked all the while by an enemy sworn to see the negotiations collapse and the mission fail.",
    " The Land of Little Rain is a collection of short stories and essays detailing the landscape and inhabitants of the American Southwest. A message of environmental conservation and a philosophy of cultural and sociopolitical regionalism loosely links the stories together. ;\"The Land of Little Rain\" The opening essay describes the \"Country of Lost Borders,\" an area of land between Death Valley and the High Sierras. The image created of the land at the beginning of the story is one of almost unbearable heat and dryness, punctuated by violent storms. Despite the description of how inhospitable the landscape is, at the end Austin proposes that the costs the land imposes upon a man are worth it because it provides man with peace of mind and body that cannot be achieved any other way. ;\"Water Trails of the Ceriso\" The section's title refers to the trails made by wild animals moving towards sources of water. The essay provides descriptions of the many animals that travel along the trails, including coyotes, rabbits, and quails. Their ability to find water where there seems to be none is extolled by Austin, a skill which she believes no human is able to match. ;\"The Scavengers\" This essay describes the various animals that live in the desert that feed upon carrion&mdash;most notably, the buzzards and the carrion crows. This scavenging is portrayed as a natural part of the desert, with a multitude of the scavengers working together to find food. The end of the story criticizes the actions of man with regard to the desert. The unnatural trash he leaves cannot used by the scavengers in the story, and as such serves as a stark contrast to the desert's natural processes for recycling waste. ;\"The Pocket Hunter\" A pocket hunter is a type of miner who hunts for pockets of ore deposits. In the story, the pocket hunter described by Mary Austin lives off of the land with minimal interactions with the civilized world. This harmony with nature, Austin argues, is essential to the pocket hunter's simple happiness. Despite Austin's muted praise, the pocket hunter wants to strike it rich in order to move to Europe and mingle with the landed elite, a goal he accomplishes. However, by the end of the story, the pocket hunter returns to the desert since it is his \"destiny\". ;\"Shoshone Land\" \"Shoshone Land\" narrates the experiences of Winnenap', an American Indian medicine man originally from Shoshone Land who was captured by the Paiute tribe. The story initially revolves around Winnenap', but quickly changes to a detailed description of the environment and wildlife of Shoshone Land to form an intimate tie between Winnenap' and the land he formerly inhabited. ;\"Jimville&mdash;a Bret Harte Town\" In the beginning of the section, Jimville is touted as a better source of inspiration for Bret Harte than he found during his own travels. Jimville's inhabitants are likened to the fictional characters that were present in some of Harte's short stories. Austin portrays Jimville as a small town set in a harsh environment and inhabited by simple yet endearing toughs. Although the inhabitants endure many hardships, Austin claims that there is an almost unexplainable pull which keeps them in town and encourages new travelers to stay. ;\"My Neighbor's Field\" The story is about a plot of land which changes hands many times&mdash;Austin characterizes this plot of land as an ideal field. She criticizes the owners of the field, the Indians and shepherds, because their habits and lifestyle scar the land. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the field is destined to develop into an urban area. Austin claims that while the field may at that point serve a greater human use, it will not be better for the land and all life. ;\"The Mesa Trail\" This section describes one of the trails that runs through the American Southwest. It contains several passages detailing the damage human activity has done to the land. She criticizes the \"unsightly scars\" left by the Paiute Indians in the form of abandoned campoodies and the damaged plant life left by domesticated animals such as sheep. ;\"The Basket Maker\" This story follows the life of Seyavi, a Paiute Indian who loses her mate, lives alone with her child, and sells baskets she weaves in order to survive. Austin claims that the Paiutes make the land itself their home, with the natural ridges of mountains as walls and the wild almond bloom as their furnishings. It is because of this that Austin argues that the Paiutes will always be homesick when in homes built by man, as man cannot replicate nature's walls and furnishings. ;\"The Streets of the Mountains\" This essay consists of long description of mountains and their respective trails. The section characterizes the beauty of the mountains and their inhabitants. The story also contains critiques people who dwell in man-made houses. The comfort provided by such houses, Austin argues, results in people not being able to truly understand the beauty and divinity of the mountains. ;\"Water Borders\" The essay revolves around the streams and lakes that can be found in the mountains, generally formed from the melting snow higher in the mountains. The particular mountain in the story is Oppapago, a mountain within the Sierras in a forest reserve. Austin contrasts the mountain landscape to a meadow outside a forest reserve, which lacks color and beauty because it is damaged by the grazing of sheep. ;\"Other Water Borders\" \"Other Water Borders\" is centered more on the plants affected by the water from the mountains, both wild and cultivated. The story begins with a depiction of a squabble between several locals over an irrigation ditch filled by water from the mountains. This is followed by a series of descriptions of the variety of plants that the irrigation ditch allows to thrive. Found within these depictions of plant life is Austin's lament of the complexities of civilization. Austin implies that with the advent of cities and manufactured objects people have lost an innate ability to know what natural remedies may be beneficial or detrimental to one's health. ;\"Nurslings of the Sky\" The \"nurslings of the sky\" are storms, formed in the hills and given almost human characteristics by Austin. The beginning of the story contains an account of the destruction of a town by floods and snow. The blame for the events is not placed on nature, but rather the people whose poorly placed town was destroyed. The story continues with descriptions of storms and their effects upon the wildlife of the area, pausing to explain how the land teaches people things. The story uses the example of a group of Native Americans who learn the use of smoke signals by observing the dust pillars formed by desert winds at the edges of mesas. The end of the story expresses Austin's discontent at how people have dealt with the weather by determining the best seasons to plant crops rather than by musing about the \"eternal meanings of the skies\". ;\"The Little Town of the Grape Vines\" \"The Little Town of Grape Vines,\" or El Pueblo de Las Uvas, tells a story of a simple people living in peace with their environment. With houses made of mud, homemade wine, and gardens to provide the fruits, vegetables, and herbs, the townspeople live a simple life without the complex notions of wealth and class that Austin feels have corrupted much of society. Austin describes the lives of the people living in the town, lives which consist of little more than planting, harvesting, eating, making music, raising children, and dancing. The end of the story is a call back to the simple life exemplified in \"The Little Town of the Grape Vines,\" criticizing those people who are overly obsessed with their own perceived importance in a world where their actions truly matter little.",
    " The book shares the personal stories of several families fighting autism. These stories focus on alternative autism therapies that they try to heal their children, as well as McCarthy's own reminiscing about her autistic child and her outspoken and contentious activism. The book includes the daughter of the founder of Autism Speaks, who claims to have changed her son's diet and improved his autism despite conspiratorial resistance from the organization, which, the book claims, until recently, rejected research into biomedical treatments; a mother who is claimed \"healed\" her son of his autism while taking on breast cancer; a father whose son was officially undiagnosed after allegedly under-going treatment for a laundry list of debilitating autism symptoms and regressions; and a sixty-year-old woman who made attempts to fight to save her son (now thirty) in the 1980s, the book exclaims that she paved the way for the parents of today. The book also features a list of controversial autism resources and a directory of DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) doctors who are sympathetic to the widely discredited theory that autism is caused by mercury in vaccines.",
    " Azriel is telling the story of his transformation into and subsequent existence as an immortal genii who is forced to obey the Master who calls him. Over centuries, Azriel becomes less obedient to the Masters and a warning is placed on the casket of his bones that he is not to be summoned lest his evil be loosed upon the undeserving world. After many centuries of rest, Azriel finds himself awake and in New York City, a dazed witness to the murder of a young woman, Esther Belkin. He becomes inexplicably obsessed with the desire to avenge her death and to find out who called him into the physical world in time to see Esther die but not in time to save her. This quest leads him to the girl's stepfather, Gregory Belkin, who would pay any price to fulfill his messianic dream via his immense worldwide religious organization, the Temple of the Mind of God. As his quest approaches its climax, he risks his supernatural powers to forestall an attempt to destroy the world thus redeeming what was denied him for so long: his own eternal human soul.",
    " The story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947. Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old. Thursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him. Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenburg cake, has some curious house guests: Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos. Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them. Despite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues. She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the aging English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike. Thursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him. On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\"). Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday. Goliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO -- at their headquarters in the Isle of Man -- and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness. Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband. Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilize. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly. On top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final in order to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy). She succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.",
    " Up to this time Cornwell had been going back through the period of the Napoleonic Wars to find new incidents into which to place his hero. Rather than do this, he adopts a \"prequel\" approach and uses an earlier campaign period in the history of the British Army, that of colonial India. The novel opens with Richard Sharpe serving as a private with the British army, then invading Mysore and advancing on the Tippoo Sultan's capital city of Seringapatam. Sharpe is contemplating desertion with his paramour, widow Mary Bickerstaff. His sadistic company sergeant, Obadiah Hakeswill, deliberately provokes Sharpe into attacking him, and engineers the virtual death sentence of 2,000 lashes for the private. But Sharpe is rescued by Lieutenant William Lawford after 200 lashes are inflicted, in order to effect a rescue mission behind the Tippoo's lines. Lawford and Sharpe are ordered to pose as deserters to rescue Colonel Hector McCandless, chief of the British East India Company's intelligence service. Although Lawford is nominally in command, Sharpe quickly dominates the lieutenant by force of personality and, without authorization, brings Mary on the mission. Joining the Tippoo's army, they discover that the Tippoo has set a trap for the invading British by mining the weakest (and thus most inviting) portion of Seringapatam's walls. Before Sharpe and Lawford can discover a way to transmit a warning to the British, they are betrayed by Sergeant Hakeswill. Hakeswill has been captured in battle and the Tippoo orders him made a human sacrifice for victory, but Hakeswill secures the Sultan's mercy in exchange for revealing Sharpe's and Lawford's identity as spies. Sharpe and Lawford are imprisoned as the British army prepares to assault the booby-trapped wall of the city. Mary helps Sharpe to escape, and Sharpe blows up the mine before the main British army can enter the trap. As the Tippoo tries to flee the city, Sharpe finds him in a dark tunnel, kills him, and steals his rich jewels. Sharpe throws Hakeswill to the Tippoo's tigers, but the recently fed animals ignore Hakeswill, and Sharpe's enemy survives to plague him in later adventures.",

    " On Abarrach, Xar is attempting to learn the secret of necromancy, but he needs a corpse to test it on. He interrogates the lazar Kleitus about the location of any living Sartan, and Kleitus reveals that Haplo lied to Xar about all the Sartan dying at the hands of the dead; Balthazar and his group remain living. Kleitus drops a hint about the Seventh Gate, and reveals that it's where the Sundering took place and that Haplo's corpse would know its location. Xar dismisses this idea, as well as the lazar, and is quickly becoming obsessed with the Seventh Gate when receives word that two Sartan have been captured: Zifnab, for one, whose pleas on Haplo's behalf go unheeded; and, as quite a prize, Samah, ruler of the Council of Seven. Xar is initially excited since Samah is the very person who would know the Seventh Gate's location, and he interrogates Samah for it to no avail. Sang-drax&mdash; the one who actually captured Samah and Zifnab&mdash; is summoned by Xar to mentally torture Samah to death; even before he dies, Samah does not reveal anything useful. Xar succeeds in turning him into a far-more-complacent lazar, but too much of Samah's will remains, and he still won't talk. Even worse, when Xar turns his back to investigate Zifnab's disappearance, Jonathan walks in and teaches Samah how to let go; the leader of the Council of Seven is now well and truly dead. Xar is soon told by Sang-drax of Haplo's \"treachery\"; he has helped the mensch start the Kicksey-winsey and given control of Arianus over to the mensch, instead of reserving it for Xar himself. Party to this conversation is the loyal servant who informed Xar of the capture and has already been ordered to investigate the Arianus situation: Marit, the woman Haplo loved, the mother of his child. Xar marries her in traditional Patryn fashion of rune-joining, both to ensure her loyalty and because it gives them an unblockable way to communicate, and then orders her to kill Haplo. Haplo rests on Arianus and tries to heal his heart-rune, a job that truly needs two people (most rune-healing is accomplished by \"circling\" and allowing strength from one person to flow to the other.) Prince Rees'ahn and King Stephen's deputy, the wizard Trian, have come to Drevlin to talk with High Froman Limbeck Bolttightener in the hopes of hammering out some sort of true alliance between all three races of mensch (the mysteriarchs having folded into the human race after their leader Sinistrad's death.) Haplo gives the Kenkari book to Limbeck, and the three races together reactivate the Kicksey-winsey, which realigns the scattered islands of Arianus and starts a constant flow of water through the sky. Then Haplo enters his dragonship and prepares to leave for the last time. Hugh, under contract to kill Haplo, retraces his own steps. He goes from the Cathedral of the Albedo back to the Fortress of the Brotherhood, where Ciang gives him a cursed knife: ugly, badly made, capable of self-movement... and covered in Sartan runes. It is the only weapon the Brotherhood has that might even possibly be capable of killing Haplo. As payment for it, Ciang orders him to never return or further payment will be taken in his blood. Hugh, in the end, doesn't even use his new Cursed Blade&mdash; its main advantage, suppressing Haplo's warning runes and a good amount of his magic, allows Hugh to sneak up on him in his ship and capture him, but the tables turn and Hugh accidentally ends up with Haplo's knife in his gut... only to lurch back from the grave, Alfred's necromancy rune having evidently condemned him to eternal life. Haplo circles with Hugh to calm the human's distress at returning from the dead yet again, and the two begin to plan how to find Alfred when they are interrupted. Marit appears and fights both Haplo and Hugh. The first time they engage their Patryn rune-magic, however, the Cursed Blade reacts, transmuting itself into various threats, and the three break off their conflict periodically to quiet it down (they can't really make it stop;) they also struggle over the ship's steering-stone. Eventually Haplo takes the ship to Chelestra, hoping to douse the Cursed Blade in seawater, but the knife, instead of transforming into another weapon or creature, summons a dragon-snake that destroys the ship. As Haplo drifts in the sea, he hears a voice and looks up to see... Alfred. At Sang-drax's misleading suggestion, Xar has gone to Pryan with the pretext of taming the tytans, and he is frustrated with his inability to reach Marit. His real reason for being there is his hope of finding the Seventh Gate in the citadel that Haplo visited, but he finds little to encourage him. The five mensch&mdash; Paithan, Rega, Aleatha, Roland, and Drugar&mdash; aren't much help, nor is Zifnab, who has somehow gotten here after escaping from Abarrach. Shortly after Xar and Zifnab have arrived, Sang-drax says he knows now that Zifnab is \"one of them;\" after a battle with Zifnab's dragon, he takes on Xar's form and steals the ship, claiming that he will search for Haplo while Xar is on Pryan. It is revealed during Xar's stay that Zifnab is actually one of the dissenting Sartan who refused to go along with Samah's plan; he was among the mensch on Earth during the Sundering, and was the first of either race to escape the Labyrinth. It was he who penned many of the books Xar educated himself with. (With all that Zifnab has seen, his total dementia seems a bit more understandable.) Xar decides to leave Pryan in a ship he spotted outside the citadel, covered in Sartan runes, but to do that he needs to get past the tytans. He decides to need to kill off the mensch and revive them with necromancy to serve as distractions. The mensch are having their own problems. Paithan is obsessed with a room in the center of the citadel that he calls the Star Chamber, a room with seven huge seats and an apparatus that generates blinding light. Roland and Aleatha are mostly not on speaking terms; the elf maiden finds herself spending more time with Drugar, who may be the last of his race. But Drugar has discovered a delightful illusion: at a certain clearing in the garden maze, at certain times of the day, he can see ghostly shadows of people from all the mensch races, walking around and talking to each other. Aleatha is there when he uses his amulet to activate the platform, teleporting him instantly to a different citadel&mdash; where, as it turns out, there are other survivors. Marit finds herself in a Sartan prison. On a bench in the middle of the room, Haplo recovers from injuries caused by the Cursed Blade. Across from it, Hugh the Hand and the dog watch her with unblinking eyes. Their \"jailer\": none other than Alfred, who rescued them from Chelestra. After some discussion, Haplo realizes that they are in the Vortex, the one-way gate at the very center of the Labyrinth. It was here that the Patryns were initially imprisoned and chose to live for generations, until people calling themselves Nexus runners started trying to escape. (It's unknown when they abandoned the Vortex and all moved out into the Labyrinth.) Haplo decides to enter the Labyrinth in search of his daughter, whom Marit named Rue. Hugh agrees to go with him, as does Marit at Xar's command; he has told Marit to hold off on killing Haplo to report back any conversations Alfred and Haplo have about the other worlds. It is only Alfred who balks. He has nothing left&mdash; Orla \"saw\" Samah's death and chose a peaceful death to be with him&mdash; but fear of the unknown. The Labyrinth itself, however, refuses to let him return to the Vortex by unceremoniously dropping a mountain on top of the exit back into it. To Haplo, the Labyrinth seems afraid of Alfred, though he can't for the life of him figure out why; what is Alfred, besides a bumbling, useless Sartan? ...who can turn into a dragon and bring people back from the dead? The group is about to be overrun by tiger-men when, surprisingly, a Patryn raiding party comes to save them. This party comes from Abri, the one and only city inside the Labyrinth (anathema to the lone-wolf Patryns). While camping overnight, Alfred admits his true name to Haplo: Coren, a Sartan word that can mean \"to choose\" or perhaps \"chosen.\" Many Sartan children were named that, in hopes of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but (as Haplo points out) Alfred did not feel particularly amused when he awoke, the last living Sartan on Arianus. Clearly Alfred was Coren, was chosen&mdash;but for what? Marit, however, betrays them by revealing that Alfred is a Sartan. Haplo, Hugh, and Alfred are jailed by the city's leader, Headman Vasu, to await Lord Xar&mdash; Marit accused Haplo of being a traitor and plotting against their people&mdash; but are freed again just as quickly after Marit overhears the disguised Sang-drax plotting to kill them. Sang-drax and his cronies are also gathering a huge army of the Labyrinth's native monsters, with which to destroy the city of Abri and seal the Final Gate; they allowed Marit to overhear them to feed off the emotions that would come from it. Abri's occupants prepare for its defense, while Haplo and Marit, prodded by the dog, finally find their love for each other. Alfred feels out of place; though few seem to begrudge him his Sartan heritage, he is still out-of-place here, a clumsy pacifist in a city preparing for war. Talking with Headman Vasu, however, he eventually discovers that the city was not made by Patryns (who do not build cities,) or at least not by Patryns alone&mdash; the Sartan \"heretics\" who were expelled into the Labyrinth were accepted by the Patryns, eventually integrating completely into the society; Vasu himself is half-and-half, supplementing his Patryn tattoos with Sartan magic. The Patryns taught them the value of family; the Sartan, in return, taught the Patryns the value of banding together. Here, at the heart of the Labyrinth, rises Abri, the city that symbolizes the best in both cultures. Alfred also finds out why he is called the Serpent Mage: it is a title from a Sartan hierarchy of strength in magic, whose levels are named after animals. Serpent is very near the top. Alfred has found the meaning of his name: to choose his power, and all the responsibility it comes with... or to choose Alfred, who would rather faint than have to use his magic. Back on Pryan, Drugar returns from the other citadel with knowledge: he knows how to stop the tytans. Aleatha has fled the maze, though; pushed into hysterics by his sudden (and literal) disappearance, she ran back to her brother, and the four are now at a \"party\" of Xar's, at which he hopes to kill them with poisoned wine so that their bodies will be undamaged. Zifnab, however, saves them by drinking all of it himself and saying that it was poisoned, faking his death once again. The mensch are horrified at the revelation that Xar means to kill them. Aleatha escapes the room, while the other three are sealed inside by Xar... until Zifnab's dragon discovers Zifnab's \"death\" and tears the room apart. Aleatha has fled once again into the maze, where Xar can't pursue her because of protective Sartan runes covering its path. She runs into Drugar and he tells her they have to let the tytans inside to help them; he shares with her how to stop them. They run for the gates, but before they can reach it, Xar attacks; Drugar sacrifices himself to save Aleatha. Xar is about to kill Aleatha when the dragon strikes, distracting Xar with battling it instead of killing mensch. The other mensch have escaped from the destroyed room and find her, and they think she's mad when she tells them what she's going to do. She uses the amulet to open the gate and invites the tytans inside; they peacefully enter and ask, &mdash;Where is the citadel? to which Aleatha answers, \"Here is the Citadel. You are home.\" Xar recovers from his battle with the dragon, and prepares to leave for the Labyrinth after Marit reports back to him&mdash; apparently corrupted by Haplo's influence into thinking Xar has made a mistake in allying with the dragon-snakes, as she says they are planning an attack. He is surprised when the tytans don't kill the mensch, and actually act to protect the mensch from him, but he avoids a fight by snatching Drugar's amulet from Aleatha and running away with it. The amulet will gain him entry into the Sartan ship, which he can then use to return to the Labyrinth. At Abri, the battle between Patryns and Labyrinth creatures rages fiercely, but the real threat comes from the dragon-snakes. Haplo, Marit, and Hugh lead a sortie to deal with them, and the three battle Sang-drax in his serpent form. Sang-drax is apparently killed by Haplo, but Haplo has been badly injured and almost crushed beneath the massive body. Marit is attacked by a wolfen when a green and golden dragon carries it away: Alfred, having made his choice to accept his power. He lifts the serpent's body off of Haplo, leaving Marit to hold his blood-soaked form, his heart-rune's wound having reopened. But while Alfred is distracted in battle with the dragon-snakes, Xar appears. He wants Haplo's knowledge of the Chamber of the Damned, and will stop at nothing to get it. The battle ends with the Labyrinth's armies driven off, but Marit dazed and wounded, Haplo abducted by Xar, and Alfred missing in action.",
    " The Eight features two intertwined storylines set centuries apart. The first takes place in 1972 and follows American computer expert Catherine “Cat” Velis as she is sent to Algeria for a special assignment. The second is set in 1790 and revolves around Mireille, a novice nun at Montglane Abbey. The fates of both characters are intertwined as they try to unravel the mystery behind the Montglane Service, a chess set that holds the key to a game of unlimited power. A gift from the Moors to Emperor Charlemagne, these pieces have been hunted fervently throughout the years by those seeking ultimate control. In the throes of the French Revolution, Mireille and her cousin Valentine must help in dispersing the pieces of the chess set to keep them out of the wrong hands. However, when Valentine is brutally murdered in Reign of Terror, Mireille is thrown into the midst of men and women who would pursue power at any cost, including Napoleon, Robespierre, Talleyrand, Catherine the Great, and more. She comes to realize she must rely on her own intuition and tenacity to accomplish her goal. In 1972, Cat Velis faces a similar atmosphere of conspiracy, assassination and betrayal. When she is requested by an antique dealer to recover the chess pieces, she unwittingly enters into a mysterious game that will endanger her life. As she learns the story of the Montglane Service, she begins to realize that players of the Game may plan their moves, but their very existence makes them pawns as well.",

    " In his \"Preliminary Discourse\", Barruel defines the three forms of conspiracy as the \"conspiracy of impiety\" against God and Christianity, the \"conspiracy of rebellion\" against kings and monarchs, and \"the conspiracy of anarchy\" against society in general. He sees the end of the 18th century as \"one continuous chain of cunning, art, and seduction\" intended to bring about the \"overthrow of the altar, the ruin of the throne, and the dissolution of all civil society\". The first volume examines the anti-Christian conspiracy that was begun by Voltaire in 1728 when Barruel claimed that Voltaire \"consecrated his life to the annihilation of Christianity\". Barruel returned to the principal texts of the Enlightenment and found reasons to draw close links between the philosophism of the time and the anti-Christian campaigns of the Revolution. Here he found that the philosophes had created an age of pretend philosophy which they used in their battle with Christianity. Their commitment to liberty and equality were really commitments of \"pride and revolt\". Barruel claimed that the proponents of the Enlightenment led people into illusion and error and refers to the philosophes as \"Writers of this species, so far from enlightening the people, only contribute to lead them into the path of error\". He alleged that Voltaire, dAlembert, and Frederick II, the King of Prussia, planned the course of events that lead to the French Revolution. They began with an attack on the Church where a \"subterranean warfare of illusion, error, and darkness waged by the Sect\" attempted to destroy Christianity. The influence of the philosophes could not be underrated according to Barruel. They created the intellectual framework that put the conspiracy in motion and controlled the ideology of the secret societies. Barruel appears to have read the work of the philosophes and his direct and extensive quotes shows a deep knowledge of their beliefs. This is unusual among the enemies of the Enlightenment, who rarely distracted themselves by reading the works and authors they were attacking. Barruel believed the philosophes were important as the original villains that seduced the population and made Enlightenment, and subsequently revolutionary, ideals favorable. The second volume focuses on the anti-monarchical conspiracy that was led by Jean Jacques Rousseau and Baron de Montesquieu. These conspirators sought to destroy the established monarchies under the guise of \"Independence and Liberty\". Barruel analyses and criticizes Montesquieus The Spirit of Laws and Rousseaus Social Contract because the application of the ideas expressed in these books had \"given birth to that disquieted spirit which fought to investigate the rights of sovereignty, the extent of their authority, the pretended rights of the free man, and without which every subject is branded for a slave - and every king a despot\". He believed that the influence of these two writers was a necessary factor in the enactment of the French Revolution. He agreed with the revolutionaries as they themselves placed the remains of Voltaire and Rousseau in the Pantheon to pay homage to the \"fathers of the revolution\". Barruel believed that the philosophes had created a lasting influence as their spirit survived through their writings and continued to promote anti-monarchical feelings within the Jacobins and the revolutionaries. The destruction of monarchies in Europe led to the triumph of the Jacobins as they trampled \"underfoot the altars and the thrones in the name of that equality and that liberty which summon the peoples to the disasters of revolution and the horrors of anarchy\". Barruel equated the rejection on monarchy with a rejection of any type of order and government. As a result, the principles of equality and liberty and their attacks against the monarchy were attacks against all governments and civil society. He presented a choice to his readers between monarchy and the \"reign of anarchy and absolute independence\". Barruels third volume addresses the antisocial conspiracy that was the objective of the Freemasons and the Order of the Illuminati. The philosophes and their attacks against the church and the throne paved the way for the conspiracy that was led by these secret societies. These groups were believed to have constituted a single sect that numbered over 300,000 members who were \"all zealous for the Revolution, and all ready to rise at the first signal and to impart the shock to all others classes of the people\". Barruel surveyed the history of Masonry and maintained that its higher mysteries had always been of an atheist and republican cast. He believed the Freemasons kept their words and aims secret for many years but on August 12, 1792, two days after the fall of the French monarchy, they ran though the streets openly announcing their secrets. The secret words were \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" and the secret aim was the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the republic. Barruel claimed he heard them speak these words in France but that in other countries the Masons still kept their secrets. A division of the group into numerous lodges ensured that if the secrets of one lodge were discovered, the rest would remain hidden. He believed that it was his job to warn all governments and people of the goals of the Freemasons. Barruel described in detail how this system worked in the case of the Illuminati. Even after Johann Adam Weishaupt, the leader of the sect, was discovered and tried in court, the proceedings could not uncover the universal influence of the Illuminati and no steps were taken against the group. The majority of the secret societies could always survive and carry on their activities because of the organization of the group. The Illuminati, as a whole, functioned to radicalize the movement against the throne and altar and influenced more members of the population to subscribe to their hidden principles. They refined the secret structure that had been provided by the Masons basic framework. For Barruel, the final designs of the coalition of the philosophes, the Freemasons and the Illuminati were achieved by the Jacobins. These clubs were formed by \"the adepts of impiety, the adepts of rebellion, and the adepts of anarchy\" working together to implement their radical agenda. Their guiding philosophy and actions were the culmination of the conspiracy as they directly wanted to end the monarchy and the church. Barruel believed that the only difference between the Jacobins and their precursors was that the Jacobins actually brought down the church and the throne and were able to institute their basic beliefs and goals while their precursors only desired to do these things without much success. According to Barruel, the first major assault on the Enlightenment came during the French Revolution. In the minds of many, the Enlightenment was inextricably connected to the Revolution that followed. This presumed link resulted in an explosion of literature that was hostile to the Enlightenment. When the leaders of the Revolution canonized Voltaire and Rousseau and made the Enlightenment themes of reason, progress, anti-clericalism and emancipation central to their own revolutionary vocabulary, it created a link that meant any backlash against the Revolution would increase opposition to the Enlightenment. The advent of what Graeme Garrard has called the \"continuity thesis\" between the Enlightenment and the Revolution – the belief that they were connected in some intrinsic way, as cause and effect- proved damaging to the Enlightenment. For Barruel, the Revolution was not a spontaneous popular uprising expressing a long-suppressed general will. It was instead the consequence of a united minority group who used force, subterfuge and terror to impose their will on an innocent and unsuspecting population. Barruel believed that the Revolution was caused by Voltaire, Rousseau and the other philosophes who conspired with secret societies to destroy Catholicism and the monarchy in France. He argued that the writings of the philosophes had a great influence on those who would lead the Revolution and that Voltaire and his followers were responsible for the training of revolutionaries. It was from the followers of the philosophes \"that the revolutionary ministers Necker and Turgot started up; from this class arose those grand revolutionary agents, the Mirabeaux, Sieyes, Laclos, Condorcets; these revolutionary trumps, the Brissots, Champforts, Garats, Cheniers; those revolutionary butchers, the Carras, Frerons, Marats\". Within the Memoirs, Barruel alleged that Diderots Encyclopédie was a Masonic project. He believed that the written works of the philosophes penetrated all aspects of society and that this massive collection was of particular significance. The Encyclopédie was only the first step in philosophizing mankind and was necessary to spread the impious and anti-monarchical writings. This created a mass movement against the church and society. Barruel believed that the conspirators attempt to \"imbue the minds of the people with the spirit of insurrection and revolt\" and to promote radicalism within all members of society. This was believed to be the main reason behind the Encyclopédie as it was \"a vast emporium of all the sophisms, errors, or calumnies which had ever been invented against religion\". It contained \"the most profligate and impious productions of Voltaire, Diderot, Boulanger, La Mettrie, and of other Deists or Atheists of the age, and this under the specious pretence of enlightening ignorance\". Barruel believed the volumes of the Encyclopédie were valuable in controlling the minds of intellectuals and in creating a public opinion against Christianity and monarchy. Philosophism was a term used by Barruel within the Memoirs to refer to the pretend philosophy that the philosophes practiced. It was originally coined by Catholic opponents of the philosophes but was popularized by Barruel. It referred to the principles that were shared by philosophes, Freemasons, and Illuminati. Barruel defined philosophism as \"the error of every man who, judging of all things by the standard of his own reason, rejects in religious matters every authority that is not derived from the light of nature. It is the error of every man who denies the possibility of any mystery beyond the limits of reason if everyone who, discarding revelation in defence of the pretended rights of reason, Equality, and Liberty, seeks to subvert the whole fabric of the Christian religion\". The term had a lasting influence as by the end of the 18th century it had become a popular term of abuse used by conservative journals to refer to supporters of the Revolution. These journals accused those who practiced philosophism as having no principles or respect for authority. They were skeptics who failed to believe in the monarchy and the church and thus, had no principles. The use of the term became pervasive in the Anti-Jacobin Review and contributed to the belief in a connection between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and its supporters. Philosophism became a powerful tool of anti-revolutionary and anti-Jacobin rhetoric. Barruel identified a number of individuals who he believed played direct roles in the Enlightenment and the conspiracy against Christianity and the state. He identified Voltaire as the \"chief\", d’Alembert as the \"most subtle agent\", Frederick II as the \"protector and adviser\", and Diderot as its \"forlorn hope\". Voltaire was at the head of the conspiracy because he spent his time with the highest levels of European society. His attention and efforts were directed at kings and high ranking ministers. DAlembert worked behind the scenes and inside the more common areas of French society. He employed his skill in the cafes and academies and attempted to bring more followers to the conspiracy. Barruel takes a close look at the correspondence between Voltaire and dAlembert and uses this as evidence of their plot to overthrow society. He is deeply concerned with the fact that those he identifies as the leaders of the plot had secret names for one another in their private correspondence. Voltaire was \"Raton\", dAlembert was \"Protagoras\", Frederick was \"Luc\", and Diderot was known as \"Plato\". Barruel also argued that the conspiracy extended far beyond this small group of philosophes. He believed that the court of Louis XV was a \"Voltairean ministry\" of powerful men. This group involved Marquis dArgenson who \"formed the plan for the destruction of all religious orders in France\", the Duc de Choiseul who was \"the most impious and most despotic of ministers\", the \"friend and confidant of dAlembert\", Archbishop de Briennes, and Malesherbes, \"protector of the conspiracy\". According to Barruel, this group of influential leaders worked together with a number of adepts who supported the conspiracy. The most important adept that Barruel identifies is Condorcet. Barruel claimed that Condorcet was a Freemason and leading member of the Society of 1789 who was elected to the Legislative Assembly and was \"the most resolute atheist\". Condorcet was important because he embodied everything that Barruel claimed the conspiracy was. He was a Freemason that associated with the philospohes and who would become an influential member of the revolution process. Barruel also lists the Baron dHolbach, Buffon, La Mettrie, Raynal, Abbé Yvon, Abbé de Prades, Abbé Morrelet, La Harpe, Marmontel, Bergier and Duclos among the members of the \"synagogue of impiety\".",

    " In South Africa under apartheid, Mehring is a rich white businessman who is not satisfied with his life. His ex-wife has gone to America, his liberal son (who is probably gay) criticizes his conservative/capitalist ways and his lovers and colleagues do not seem actually interested in him. Out of a whim he buys a farm outside the city, afterwards trying to explain this purchase to himself as the search for a higher meaning in life. But it is clear that he knows next to nothing to farming, and that black workers run it - Mehring is simply an outsider, an intruder on the daily life of \"his\" farm. One day the black foreman, Jacobus, finds an unidentified dead body on the farm. Since the dead man is black, the police find no urgency to look into the case and simply bury the body on the spot where it was found. The idea of an unknown black man buried on his land begins to \"haunt\" Mehring. This has been interpreted as the influence of apartheid on the class of privileged white people who profit from it while ignoring its victims. A flood brings the body back to the surface; although the farm workers do not know the stranger, they now give him a proper burial as if he were a family member. There are hints that Mehring's own burial will be less emotional than this burial of a stranger. This can be interpreted to symbolize the white man's position in South Africa: although he \"owns\" the land on a piece of paper, the black natives have the actual claim on the land. it:Il conservatore",

When the company arrive in Brighton for a one-week run at the Theatre Royal, Flood is confident that he will be able to use his stay to get in touch with his estranged wife Jenny, who has filed for divorce and is now living with Roger Colborn, a local businessman, on the outskirts of the city. Flood is surprised to find that it is Jenny who contacts him first: She tells him she is being stalked and, as she believes that her husband is to blame for it, asks him to do something about it. This is how Flood meets Derek Oswin, the alleged stalker, an eccentric man his own age who, just like his deceased father and grandfather before him, worked for the Colborns' family business until its liquidation in 1989. It turns out Oswin has written a history of the company but so far has not found a publisher. Talking to Oswin and to other people he meets, either by chance or by design, Flood more and more gets the impression that Roger Colborn is a dangerous man who has something to hide, and that Jenny must be saved from the clutches of the Colborn family before it is too late. Thus, Flood's interest in the affairs of a now defunct company is fuelled by his desire to win back Jenny, so much so that his professional life is affected. Trying to dig up dirt on the Colborns, he is drawn into a quagmire of events he cannot make head or tail of and eventually misses an evening's performance without giving any notice. When, however, on the following day he finds his understudy&mdash;the man who saved his neck the previous night&mdash;dead in the streets of Brighton he realizes the seriousness of the situation. In the course of one week homes are broken into, evidence is stolen, several people die, family secrets are uncovered, and an inheritance is reclaimed. Justice triumphs in the end.",
    " Shortly before noon on Saturday October 21 of an unspecified year after 2012 (evident by mention of a faded bumper sticker for Barack Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign), the small Maine town of Chester's Mill is abruptly and gruesomely separated from the outside world by an invisible, semipermeable barrier of unknown origin. The immediate appearance of the barrier causes a number of injuries and fatalities, and traps former Army Captain Dale \"Barbie\" Barbara—who is trying to leave Chester's Mill—inside the town. Police Chief Howard \"Duke\" Perkins is soon killed when his pacemaker explodes after getting too close to the barrier. This removes the last significant opposition to James \"Big Jim\" Rennie, used car salesman and the town's Second Selectman. Big Jim exerts significant influence within Chester's Mill, and seizes the opportunity to use the barrier as part of a power play to take over the town. Big Jim appoints one of his cronies, the incompetent Peter Randolph, as the new Police Chief. He also begins expanding the ranks of the Chester's Mill Police with questionable candidates, including his son, Junior Rennie, and his friends. Junior has frequent migraines caused by an as-yet undiscovered brain tumor which has also begun affecting his mental state; unbeknownst to Big Jim, Junior was in the process of beating and strangling a girl to death when the barrier appeared, and has killed another girl by the time Rennie places him on the police force. Elsewhere in Chester's Mill, Julia Shumway, the editor of the local newspaper, is phoned by Colonel James O. Cox, who has her carry a message to Barbie to contact him. When he does, Cox requests that Barbie act as the government's liaison in an effort to bring down the Dome, as it has come to be known. Because of Barbie's talents as a former bomb factory hunter, Cox gives him the task of locating the source, which is believed to be inside the Dome. Cox is also able to foresee the small town political ramifications of such a situation. By virtue of a Presidential order, Barbie is reinstated in the US Military and promoted to full Colonel. Barbie is also presented with a decree granting him authority over the township. However, smalltown politics being what they are, this action is not well received by Big Jim and his misguided band of renegade police officers. As Big Jim covertly encourages and orchestrates unease and panic among the town to build up his grab for power, Barbie, Julia and a number of other townspeople attempt to stop things from spiraling out of control. After crossing Rennie's path on several occasions, Barbie is framed and arrested for 4 murders. He is accused of killing Reverend Lester Coggins, who laundered money for Rennie's large-scale methamphetamine operation, and Duke's widow Brenda Perkins, who were both murdered by Big Jim. While Barbie is in jail other residents track the source of the Dome to an abandoned farm, and the device is strongly indicated to be extraterrestrial in origin. The restrictions issued by Rennie become more severe and the police force grows more abusive, galvanizing the town and eventually leading some residents to break Barbie out of jail, killing Junior seconds before he can murder Barbie. The semi-organized resistance flees to the abandoned farm, where multiple people touch the strange object and experience visions. They not only conclude that the device was put in place by extraterrestrial \"leatherheads\" (so named for their appearance), but that specifically they are juveniles who have set up the Dome as a cruel form of entertainment, a sort of ant farm used to capture sentient beings and allow their captors to view everything that happens inside. On an organized \"Visitors Day\"—when people outside the Dome can meet at its edge with people within—Big Jim sends Randolph and a detachment of police to take back control of his former meth operation from Phil \"Chef\" Bushey, who is stopping Rennie from covering up the operation as well as hoarding the more than four-hundred tanks of propane stored there. Many are killed in the ensuing gunfight and Chef, who is mortally wounded, detonates a plastic explosive device he has placed in the meth production facility. The ensuing explosion, combined with the propane and meth-making chemicals, unleashes a toxic firestorm. More than a thousand of the town's residents are quickly incinerated on national television, leaving alive only the twenty-six survivors at the abandoned barn, an orphaned farm boy hiding in a potato cellar, and Big Jim and his informal aide-de-camp, Carter Thibodeau, in the town's fallout shelter. Big Jim and Thibodeau eventually turn on each other; Big Jim stabs and disembowels Thibodeau, only to die several hours later when hallucinations of the dead send him fleeing into the now-toxic environment outside. The survivors at the barn begin to slowly asphyxiate, despite efforts by the Army to force clean air through the walls of the Dome. Barbie and Julia go to the control device to beg their captors to release them. Julia is able to make contact with a single female leatherhead, no longer accompanied by her friends and thus not caught up in their peer pressure. After repeatedly expressing that they are real sentient beings with real \"little lives\", and by sharing a painful childhood incident with the adolescent alien, Julia convinces the leatherhead to have pity on them. The Dome raises up slowly and vanishes, allowing the toxic air to dissipate and finally freeing the town of Chester's Mill.",

It can be read simultaneously as an unusual, charming love story, a description of the political and social forces at work in 1920s Brazil, a somewhat satirical depiction of Latin American aspirations to \"modernity\", and a celebration of the local culture and pleasures of Bahia. The book was made into series for Brazilian television in 1960, in 1976 and again in 2012. A feature film of the novel was directed by Bruno Barreto in 1983. The feature version starred Sonia Braga as Gabriela and Marcello Mastroianni as Nacib, and featured original music by Antonio Carlos Jobim.",
    " As a restless high school athlete in a small, unnamed town in North Carolina, Jason Maddox, the book's narrator, has a sexual encounter with his popular girlfriend’s alcoholic mother. Rumors of the encounter circulate at school, and Jason’s girlfriend, distraught when she learns of them, attempts suicide. Jason, himself previously popular, is shunned by his classmates, including the one who started the rumors. Jason confronts and savagely beats that classmate, and in the aftermath, he's arrested, expelled from school, and all but disowned by his conservative, mortified parents. Taking a job as a house painter, Jason moves into an apartment complex where he befriends his new neighbor, Bernard “Peewee” Mash, an intellectually precocious fifteen-year-old who, like Jason, is a local pariah. Peewee introduces Jason to art, literature, and, most importantly, punk rock. He and Jason are particularly enamored of the Los Angeles punk band Rule of Thumb, which is led by a Berkeley-educated poet, Jim Cassady, whom Jason and Peewee both revere. Learning that Rule of Thumb will be performing at New York City’s CBGB, Jason quits his job in order to drive himself and Peewee to New York. After the show, they speak to Jim Cassady, who advises them to start a band. They immediately make plans to move to Manhattan, where they live on the Lower East Side, center of the New York punk scene. There, Peewee becomes increasingly difficult, at odds with Jason musically and envious of Jason’s sexual prowess. Alternately given to tantrums and sullen silences, Peewee is ousted from the band that he co-founded. He and Jason pursue music separately until, recognizing how much they miss each other, they reconcile and start a new band. The new band has a growing reputation for its explosive, destructive shows, which result in injuries to person and property alike. Banned from most local venues, the band begins touring the U.S., and in the midst of what will prove to be its final tour, Peewee is killed in a car crash, with Jason narrowly surviving. Devastated by the loss of Peewee, Jason decides he’s finished with music, and, using money from an insurance settlement, he produces and directs a film that takes him to Los Angeles, where he falls in love with an aspiring actress who is herself seeking a new life after fleeing the civil wars in her native Yugoslavia. The actress, Irina, is married to a wealthy Englishman who is happily unaware of her affair with Jason and, possibly, others prior, though Irina denies any previous affairs to Jason. Their stormy romance is addictive to Jason, who begs Irina to leave her husband for him. She repeatedly, and emptily, assures him she will. At a party one night, Jason meets another former punk who tells him that Jim Cassady has recently been spotted, homeless and panhandling on the streets of Hollywood. This is the first sighting of Cassady, as far as Jason knows, since Rule of Thumb disbanded in the early 80s. Jason has always been mystified and intrigued by Cassady’s disappearance, and, on the Internet, he reads of other alleged Cassady sightings. Determined to find Cassady, Jason discovers that he’s now living in a bleak Los Angeles suburb with his elderly, controlling mother. He shares some of his recent songs and poems with Jason, who thinks they're deserving of a wide audience. Except for Cassady's music and the advice he gave Jason and Peewee at CBGB almost twenty years before, Jason might still be miserable in North Carolina, and he means to express his gratitude by helping Cassady gain a new following. But Cassady is resigned to obscurity, and he grudgingly submits to Jason’s efforts on his behalf. Perhaps out of spite, he causes a rupture in Jason’s relationship with Irina, and Jason promises to kill him for it, only to reaffirm, in the book's epilogue, how indebted he is to Cassady, who has again changed the course of his life.",
    " As volunteers clean up after a huge outdoor rock concert in Yorkshire in 1969, they discover the body of a young woman wrapped in a sleeping bag. She has been brutally murdered. The detective assigned to the case, Stanley Chadwick, is a hard-headed, strait-laced veteran of the Second World War. He could not have less in common with - or less regard for - young, disrespectful, long-haired hippies, smoking marijuana and listening to the pulsing sounds of rock and roll. But he has a murder to solve, and it looks as if the victim was somehow associated with the up-and-coming psychedelic pastoral band the Mad Hatters. In the present, Inspector Alan Banks is investigating the murder of a freelance music journalist who was working on a feature about the Mad Hatters for MOJO magazine. This is not the first time that the Mad Hatters, now aging rock superstars, have been brushed by tragedy. Banks finds he has to delve into the past to find out exactly what hornets' nest the journalist inadvertently stirred up.",
    " Leonora Eyre, an attractive and elegant, but essentially selfish, middle-aged woman, becomes friendly with antique dealer Humphrey Boyce and his nephew James. Both men are attracted to Leonora, but Leonora prefers the young, good-looking James to the more \"suitable\" Humphrey. While James is away on a buying trip, Leonora discovers to her annoyance that he has been seeing Phoebe, a girl of his own age. Leonora makes use of Humphrey to humiliate Phoebe, and turns out a sitting tenant in order that James can take up a flat in her own house. She does this in an apparent attempt to control his life. While abroad, the bisexual James has begun a relationship with an American, the amoral Ned, who later follows him to London. Ned prises James out of Leonora's grasp, only to reject him for another lover. James attempts a reconciliation with Leonora, but she refuses to give him a second opportunity to hurt her, and settles for the admiration of the less attractive Humphrey. As with all Pym's fiction, the novel contains many literary references, notably to works by Keats, John Milton and Henry James.",
    " The story takes place in Montefiore, Italy in the early 16th century, on the estate of a nobleman named Don Vicente de Nevada. He lives there with his seven year old daughter, Bianca, and a small staff, the two most interesting of which are Primavera, an earthy cook and Fra Ludovico. In the beginning of the novel, de Nevada finds a mirror in a pond near his manor. This mirror was fashioned by dwarves but lost when they left it in the pond to temper. Incidentally, one dwarf spends most of the novel following de Nevada to ask the return of the mirror. Life is good for the family until the day Lucrezia Borgia and her brother, Cesare, decadent children of a pope, come to visit. Cesare sends Vincente on a quest for a holy relic. While he is gone, Bianca becomes a young woman and Lucrezia becomes jealous of the girl's beauty and stealing Cesare's attention from Lucrezia. Eventually she hires a woodsman to kill Bianca. The girl escapes, and runs into seven dwarfs, who are looking for the eighth dwarf and their mirror.",
    " The book describes the construction of an important bridge in Albanian territory at an ungiven time or age. Told by a catholic monk, Gjon (Gjon is a name used by Northern Albanians who were mostly catholic prior to Turkish invasions), the story of the bridge, as seen by Gjon is filled with prissy, unhappy bureaucrats, who take the events at face value without ever trying to understand the larger forces at work. Both the river Ujana e Keqe and the bridge itself are major characters in the book, and they undergo significant transformations. One of the startling events of the book is when a \"volunteer\" is immured inside the bridge in order to make a \"sacrifice\" to the river. The man's face is captured in the plaster that surrounds him, as unforgettable as it is horrifying. Though clearly a punishment for the crime of sabotage against the bridge, as Gjon recounts this event, it is less an act of vengeance than it is a true sacrifice. But more than that, it becomes a symbol for the ignorance of and squabbling among tiny Albanian principalities and their fight amongst one another, in front of a major threat.",
    " The novel describes a world set in the year 2048 after a catastrophe which has fractured the United States into several nations. The protagonists live in San Francisco and have evolved in the direction of Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy, using wind power, local agriculture, and the like. San Francisco is presented as a mostly pagan city where the streets have been torn up for gardens and streams, no one starves or is homeless, and the city's defense council consists primarily of nine elderly women who \"listen and dream\". The novel describes \"a utopia where women are leading societies but are doing so with the consent of men.\" To the south, though, an overtly-theocratic Christian fundamentalist nation has evolved and plans to wage war against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting utopia and dystopia against each other. The basic premise resembles that of Pat Murphy's earlier novel The City, Not Long After. The story is primarily told from the points of view of 98-year-old Maya, her nominal granddaughter Madrone, and her grandson Bird. Through these and other characters, the story explores many elements from ecofeminism and ecotopian fiction.",
    " Renn, a gifted but often bullied Eight Year novice in the Echorium who can speak to Half-Creatures, is asked to assist the Singers by translating for Shaiala Two-Hoof, a wild girl brought to the Island for treatment, who claims to have been raised by centaurs. Although initially the pair argue, meeting Rialle helps to calm Shaiala and she begins to remember, enough to reveal that her memories were wiped using a mask made of khiz. Second Singer Kherron takes this excuse to insist that Shaiala and Renn leave with him to search for Frazhin, the escaped khizpriest whose body was never found. After this revelation, Rialle takes Shaiala, who was very disturbed by her recolllections, and Renn to come to the cave where she lives and meet the merlee. While Shaiala swims with the merlee, Renn rejects their friendly offers and is horrified to learn that \"crazy\" Rialle is his mother. The next day, Renn and Shaiala leave with Kherron on the Wavesong, heading to Southport. On the journey, Renn is irritable and offends Shaiala by refusing to believe her tales of centaurs. Kherron also gives Shaiala a bluestone necklace. Upon arrival, the group begin to explore Southport and Shaiala, despite being closelyguarded by a pentad of orderlies including Frenn and Lazim, escapes, only to become lost in the rough part of the city. She is kidnapped and thrown in a cellar with several street children, and Erihan, the son of Lord Nahar, the leader of the Kalerei tribe of Horselords. The children are taken away by barge towards the Plains. While Kherron attempts to trace Shaiala through her bluestone necklace, they rapidly loose track of the barge. Meanwhile, the children meet \"Aunt Yashra\", a seemingly kindly pregnant woman who asks to hear each child sing, and then chooses some to return to her \"Singing Palace\" while others are to be \"gotten rid of\". This disturbs Shaiala, who recognises Yashra, and causes friction between the children, with many of those chosen wanting to stay. However, after three days of cramped conditions, they hatch a plan to escape. Shaiala kicks a hole in the side of the boat for the children to escape through, but several are left behind as the boat begins to sink, attracting the crew's attention. Shaiala and the other remaining children are taken to Aunt Yashra's camp, where Yashra uses the khiz mask to make them passive. Shaiala remembers the mask and, with Erihan's help, escapes. Shaiala and Erihan steal Yashra's horses and head onto the Plains together to search for tracks - Erihan for Horselord's, Shaiala for centaur's. Meanwhile, Renn is asked to track Shaiala's bluestone, as novices are more sensitive than Singers. Although they follow the barge for a few days, Renn is shocked when the bluestone is suddenly underwater, and he fears Shaiala has drowned. However, the bluestone is soon retrieved by a Half-Creature similar to a merlee, known as a naga. The Singers follow the naga upriver, and eventually arrange a meeting. The naga shows them its collection of 'sparklies' - consisting of Shaiala's bluestone, a piece of khiz and Erihan's dagger. Seeing Erihan's dagger, the Singers are attacked by Lord Nahar and the Kaleri, who have been following the Singers in their search for Erihan. After a brief confrontation, the two groups agree to work together, and the Horselords tell the Singers about the Sunless Valley, reachable only though the Pass of Silence, where they suspect the children have been taken. Renn contacts the naga again and, in exchange for the return of a 'sparkly', it tells them where it found the dagger - with Shaiala's bluestone - and where it found the khiz, in the mountains. However, it leaves before Renn can ask if it knows another way into the Sunless Valley. Meanwhile, Shaiala and Erihan eventually track down Shaiala's herd of centaurs by the Dancing Canyons. Seeing them, Shaiala remembers why no-one else had spotted them - the adults use herdstones to bend light around the herd, rendering it invisible. Shaiala offers to take herdstones to the centaur foals enslaved in the Sunless Valley, and she and Erihan travel there through underwater caves, guided by naga, within which they see khiz crystal poisoning the naga eggs. Meanwhile, the Singers attempt to get through the Pass of Silence, a pass so precarious that the slightest noise can start an avalanche. However, when they are attacked, Renn accidentally cries out, setting off an avalanche. Frenn and another orderly are killed, Kherron is captured, a crystal forced into his throat, and is taken away, and only Renn's quick thinking saves himself and the other orderlies from the second avalanche set off by the Harai guarding the Pass. Grateful, Lazim finally explains how Frazhin disappeared after the Battle of the Merlee twenty years ago, and, although those sent to find his body disappeared, he was not considered a threat after the khiz was destroyed. While the orderlies attempt to disable to gong used to set off avalanches in the Pass of Silence - thereby allowing Lord Nahar and the Kaleri to pass through safely - Renn hides, only to be caught by Yashra as she brings in the captured street children, and be taken to the Khizalace - Yashra's stronghold. However, there is trouble in the Valley - Shaiala and Erihan have arrived to find the captured centaurs working as slaves to mine khiz, and have freed them with herdstones, leading a revolution. The angry foals storm the palace, leaving Shaiala and Erihan no choice but to follow. They get inside the Khizalace, but are soon separated from the centaurs. Instead, they find a group of street children, apparently hypnotised, and follow them to their dormitory, which is dominated by the presence of a giant khiz crystal. Although the pair quickly disable the guards, they are unable to break the crystal's hold on the children, and only just keep from sucumbing themselves. Renn is taken to see Singer Kherron in the dungeons, who is clearly badly injured by the khiz crystal in his throat. Frazhin arrives, and attempts to force Kherron to teach the children in the Khizalace the Songs of Power, scorning the Singer's attempts to break free. Frazhin threatens that if Kherron does not help him, he will harm Renn - whom Frazhin believes to be Kherron's son. It is made clear in the conversation that Yashra's unborn child is Frazhin's. Renn is taken away, but escapes from his guards when he hears of a \"wild centaur girl\" causing havoc in the dormitories. He hurries to find Shaiala attempting to crack the khiz with her kicks, and helps her to crack the crystal and free the children. With the Khizalace shattering around them from the blow, the Harai flee, and Shaiala and Renn hurry to free Kherron, whose voice is badly damaged from the crystal, then join the battle outside. With the arrival of the Kaleri, the battle has turned in the Singer's favour, at least until Yashra appears and seals the gates against them with khiz power, trapping them inside. Although she seems victorious, capturing Erihan as a hostage and controlling the khiz against the Kaleri, she is distracted when Singer Kherron warns her to keep an eye on Frazhin, who is trying to escape without her. She hurries after him, and between Renn's singing and the centaur's kicks, the gates are destroyed. When the group catches up to Yashra, she is watching from the lakeshore as Frazhin on a boat in the centaur calls to the naga. Although they help him initially, they suddenly turn on him and pull him under the water. Yashra, trapped by the Singers, is offered a choice: immediate execution or life on the Echorium until her child is born followed by a course of Yehn. She chooses the Echorium, for the sake of her child, and protests before she is taken away that Frazhin's crimes are the Singer's fault, for destroying his hopes of joining them when he was a child. After leaving the valley, Shaiala and Renn forget their earlier disagreements, and with Renn's singing to assist her, Shaiala successfully cracks rock to find her own herdstone. A songless Kherron, after reporting to the Echorium with Renn's help, admits that, while he would be glad to call himself Renn's father, Rialle had a close relationship with Frenn - who Renn was named for - and Renn's parentage is uncertain. Shaiala joins the Kaleri to learn to be a tribeswoman from Erihan's mother, and Renn returns to the Echorium, where he reconciles with Rialle and the merlee.",
    " The Hunter, an alien lifeform (when not inside another being, resembling a four-pound green jellyfish) with the ability to live in symbiosis with and within another creature, is in hot pursuit of another of his kind. Both crash their ships into Earth, in the Pacific Ocean, and both survive the crashes. The Hunter makes its way to shore (its erstwhile host having been killed in the crash) and takes up residence in the nearest human being it can find (as it turns out, fifteen-year-old Robert Kinnaird) without letting the human being know. By the time it has figured out enough of what goes on inside a human being to look through Bob's eyes, it is shocked to find itself within an air vessel, being carried further away from its quarry every second. As it happens, Bob is simply returning to a New England boarding school from his home on an industrial island in the Western Pacific. Once Bob arrives at school, the Hunter sees no alternative to communicating with his host. After initial attempts produce panic in the boy, the Hunter eventually finds a way to convince Bob of his presence. Bob is very accepting of his guest, perhaps beyond what would be expected of a teenage boy who learns another entity is inside him, observing his every move. The two plot a way to return home. The puzzle distracts Bob from his studies, leading to a decline in grades that the school authorities ascribe to homesickness, and he is sent home for the remainder of the term. Upon arrival, the two begin to seek out their quarry. Bob is injured by an accident. The Hunter is able to hold the wound together, but he can't stop Bob from limping, and Bob is sent to the island doctor. They see no alternative to confiding in the doctor (the Hunter is forced to show his own form to convince the man) and the doctor becomes an ally in their search. Which of the many humans on the island is the host to their quarry? It is worse than a needle in a haystack (thus the title) because a needle at least looks like a needle, not a piece of straw. The Hunter is able to solve the riddle by observing the behavior of the island people. Bob's father, known for his attention to detail and safety, has been taking amazing risks. He is at least unconsciously aware that an accident will have no ill consequences. The quarry resides within him. The Hunter confirms this, and Bob and the alien have a new puzzle—how to get the alien out of Mr. Kinnaird's body without harming the man? This time, Bob comes up with the solution. He places himself in the middle of a large number of (empty) oil cans, uses a little actual oil to start a small fire, making it look like there will be a huge explosion shortly, and calls his father for help. The fugitive alien, fearful of being killed in the explosion, knocks out his host and removes himself from Mr. Kinnaird's unconscious body. As soon as the alien is a few feet away from Bob's father, the boy grabs the one full oil can, races over to the alien, pours oil over it, and lights it on fire. He then tends to his father. Mr. Kinnaird is fine, but Bob is worried. He and the Hunter had better come up with a good story for the man, or the Hunter will have to find some way to assuage the pain of a spanking.",

    " The story involves a widow named Minna Shaw. One evening, a witch falls from her broom when it loses the ability to fly and lands in the garden near Minna Shaw's house. Minna Shaw takes her in until she recovers, and when she does, the witch calls a friend to \"drive\" her home, leaving her own broom behind. Minna Shaw discovers the broom is still in her house and leaves it alone but is startled, and more than a little afraid, when it comes to life later that evening. She discovers that the broom is harmless, as all it does is sweep, but she teaches it how to feed the chickens, chop wood, and play the piano. While most of the neighbor women and children are comfortable with the broom, the men are concerned that it had been a witch's broom. Shortly afterwards, two boys begin to harass it. The broom, apparently angered, beats them and flings their dog over the forest. The boys' parents demand that the broom be burned at the stake. Minna Shaw surprisingly agrees, and the broom is burned. Things appear normal until the broom's phantom-white ghost begins stalking the Spiveys' house. The Spiveys are so terrified that they pack up and leave the house. Minna Shaw can now be alone and listen to the broom play the piano; she'd given the Spiveys her own ordinary household broom to burn and cooked up the plan for the magical broom (which was just painted white), to scare her neighbors away. She painted it white to make it look like the \"ghost\" broom.",
    " During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands Anne Frank began to keep a diary on June 14, 1942, two days after her 13th birthday, and twenty two days before going into hiding with her mother Edith Frank, father Otto Frank, sister Margot Frank and three other people, Hermann van Pels, Auguste van Pels, and Peter van Pels. The group went into hiding in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex of her father's office building in Amsterdam. The sealed-off upper-rooms also contained a hidden door behind which the Franks would hide during the parts when Nazi soldiers were investigating the buildings for harbored Jews. Mrs. van Pels' dentist, Fritz Pfeffer, joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: the van Pels are known as the Van Daans and Fritz Pfeffer is known as Mr. Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month, until their betrayal in August 1944, which resulted in their deportation to Nazi concentration camps. Of the group of eight, only Otto Frank survived the war. Anne died in Bergen-Belsen from a typhus infection in early March, shortly (about two weeks) before liberation by British troops in April 1945.",
    " Jake spends a day having strange flashbacks of himself in a rainforest, which leaves him disturbed. That evening, after watching a boxing match with his brother and father, he leaves for a grocery store, where Tobias has discovered something has crashed and the high-ranking yeerks are trying to hide something. The other Animorphs join them, and together they infiltrate the store in fly morph. Cassie overhears Chapman saying that it was a Yeerk bug fighter. After Ax manages to reconfigure the ship's controls, the Animorphs escape, pursued by Chapman and the other Yeerks. They plan to fly the spacecraft to Washington, in order to convince the American government that Earth is under attack by extraterrestrials. When Ax discovers that the fighter's technology to keep human radar from seeing it is broken, they are intercepted by two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets, however, Cassie notices that they are over the Red Sea in the Middle East - far from their intended destination. Flying above the atmosphere, they are picked up by Visser Three's Blade ship sensors. The Animorphs, knowing they can't escape, try to fire on the Visser's vessel. Both Jake and the Blade ship fire their Dracon beams at the same time, and, coincidentally, their projectiles intersect, and both ships crash. The kids wake up in their wrecked Bug fighter. They look around, noticing that they've crash-landed in a rainforest. They assume they're in the Amazon rainforest, but are also disturbed by the fact that it is the middle of the day (whereas it was nighttime in the United States, which is in roughly the same time zone as South America). After Jake reveals the strange flashbacks he was having, Ax speculates they may have caused a \"Sario Rip\" and traveled twelve hours backwards through time, which would explain why Jake was having strange flashbacks: he was in two places at once, and the two Jakes---the \"past\" and \"future\" versions---experience each other's thoughts at random moments. However, Cassie later notices that only Jake has the flashes so Ax says that Jake is the only \"real\" person-the rest are just a memory. They soon find that the Yeerks have traveled backwards through time as well, and will need both ships to create another Sario Rip and return to the right time. Ax takes the Bug fighter's computer to prevent them from doing so, and the group ventures out into the hostile wilderness, constantly plagued by insects, fire ants, snakes and piranhas. They're pursued by the Yeerks, who ruthlessly destroy the animals and trees around them in a bid to kill the Animorphs, desperate to retrieve the precious computer. The children acquire jaguar and monkey morphs in order to traverse the rainforest more easily. They eventually stumble across a group of Amazon Indians, led by Polo, their tribal chief. Marco, who knows some Spanish, manages to roughly translate the natives' Portuguese, and Jake and Polo agree to assist one another in eliminating the Yeerks. Polo and his men kill the Hork-Bajir guarding the Blade ship with poison-tipped spears, leaving the Animorphs with Visser Three, who morphs an amphibian-like Lerdethak and picks the Animorphs off one by one. Jake morphs into a monkey to use the Ledethak's vine like arms to move himself to Visser Three's body. He then throws a poison-tipped spear into Visser Three: while never revealed, this may have been fatal. Regardless, Visser Three is still able to use an arm to break Jake's neck. However, Jake wakes up back at the grocery store, just as they are about to infiltrate it. He calls off the operation, and the Animorphs all go home. The next day Jake asks Ax what had happened. Ax postulates that the travel through time created two separate versions of Jake. The reason Jake simply \"woke up\" back at the grocery store was that the Jake in the rainforest died at the hands of Visser Three; since it is impossible for one consciousness to exist in two separate locations, when one was eliminated the two snapped back together. Ax also speculates that Jake had to die, or else both Jakes and both their universes would collide and cease to exist. The events in the rainforest never actually happened (including the acquisition of jaguar and monkey morphs), and only remain in Jake's memory. He is left with a feeling of chilling relief. *Sario Rips are introduced and explained.",

Figuring that it will reincarnate him if he changes it to plus and jumps in, he does so. It is left to the reader to decide whether Connor and Scrote were reincarnated or were fully annihilated.",
    " Count von Count and other Muppets are returning from a country drive in the Countmobile. But, in classic suspense/horror movie fashion, the bridge is out, so the group has to spend the night at a spooky old house. A giant monster butler escorts each character to a room, decorated entirely in one of the seven colors of the rainbow. No one is especially gruntled by their accommodations: Cookie Monster longs for a green cookie to go well with his green room, while the Count von Count does not like his red room (not one little bit of it), Ernie is not too thrilled with his purple room, Oscar the Grouch finds himself trapped in a bright pink room, filled with flowers and hearts, while Bert longs for a beige room over an orange one, Betty Lou is blinded by yellow, and even Grover finds himself depressed by his matching blue room. The group rapidly depart the next morning, happy to leave the weird house and return. The Sesame Street residents are unaware that the House of Seven Colors is in fact a tourist attraction, frequented by vast car and busloads of monsters who feel right at home in rooms that match their fur.",
    " The novel is narrated by Alexias, a noble Athenian youth, who becomes a noted beauty in the city and a champion runner. The novel suggests that young male Athenians were treated almost like modern debutantes and wooed by older men seeking to be their lovers; in fact, in a memorable passage, Alexias' father, Myron, himself a former beauty and champion athlete, writes to his son before leaving Athens for the Sicilian Expedition. The father imparts to the son the traits he should seek in a lover – qualities like honor, loyalty and courage. However, the father also warns the son not to become involved with women as he is much too young. (See Athenian pederasty.) The book implies that Myron had been Alcibiades' lover when the latter was a teenager, and felt that the way that Alcibiades turned out was at partly Myron's fault at least, as it was his responsibility as a lover to teach his eromenos virtue. As an Ephebe (adolescent male), Alexias falls in love with Lysis, a man in his 20s – a champion pankratiast and a student of Socrates. The novel follows their the relationship through the Peloponnesian War, the surrender of Athens, the establishment of the Thirty Tyrants rule over Athens, the democratic rebellion of Thrasybulus and shortly after. The story ends with first hints of the eventual trial of Socrates for teaching blasphemy and sowing social disorder. From the beginning of the novel, Socrates figures prominently; both Alexis and Lysis become his students in their youth. Also characterized in the novel are Plato and several figures from his Dialogues who were Socrates' students, including Xenophon. Another historical figure who figures in the story, albeit mostly off-stage, is Alcibiades, the Athenian general who flees Athens on a charge of sacrilege and functions as a military adviser to Sparta until he is recalled by a resurgent democracy in Athens. Alexis and Lysis serve under Alcibiades' command until his carelessness leads the fleet to disaster and he once again goes into exile. In the course of the novel, Lysis falls in love with and marries a woman who sees Alexias favorably and encourages the continuation of her husband's relationship with him. Not long after this, Athens is defeated by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Alexias' father is murdered under the Spartan-installed tyranny, and he and Lysis go into exile in Thebes joining Thrasybulus when he leads the next democratic revolt. Lysis is killed in the battle between the Long Walls running from the port of Piraeus to Athens (the Battle of Munychia). Shortly after the victory, Alexias takes Lysis' widow under his protection, marries her and continues his family line. The book ends with the postscript that this story (incomplete and long-forgotten) has been found by Alexias' grandson (also named Alexias), a commander of Athenian cavalry in the service of Alexander the Great.",

    " Jango begins with Seeker, Morning Star and Wildman who are all being taught in the Nom and are near the end of their training. Their teacher, Chance, mentions the secret skill of a Noble Warrior, and tells them a new teacher will be assigned to them to help them attain this secret skill. He then hands them over to Miriander, who puts them through training to learn how to control another's will by using lir. Once this training is over, it is discovered that Seeker has power without limits. Unlike the other Noble Warriors, he is able to suck the lir out of any living thing and doesn't get weary doing so. He fights and defeats Chance. Afterwards, he is told to stay in one place while the Elder and the council of the Nomana decide what to do with him, as they feel that they should not loose such power in the world, yet he might be the one the save the Nomana. In the trees of the forest called the Glimmen lives Echo Kittle who is described as being pale, slender and beautiful. She is captured by the Orlan leader, Amroth Jahan, who intends to arrange a marriage between her and one of his sons. She refuses to do so until the Jahan threatens to burn down the Glimmen and kill everyone in it. She decides to go along with them and soon they arrive in Radiance, which is led by Soren Similin. After a series of events taking up more than half the book, Similin manages to form an alliance between the Jahan and Radiance so they can destroy Anacrea with the use of charged water, which has huge explosive power. Neither the Jahan or Radiance intends to share the victory with the other. In his cell, Seeker is told by a Noma, Narrow Path, that the council of the Nom has decided to cleanse Seeker. Narrow Path believes this is the wrong decision and, knowing that he himself will be cleansed for this act, sets Seeker free, and tells him that he must go and fight the true threat; the Savanters, whom live in the land cloud. Seeker heads off to the land cloud, which is on the opposite side of the Glimmen, and on the way there he meets Jango sitting by a strange door in a broken down wall. At first, Jango seems to be a crazy old man, until he begins citing many of Seeker's personal thoughts. He gives Seeker much cryptic advice on how to defeat the Savanters and cites Noman's famous quote. (see Noman's experiment). Seeker continues on his way through the Glimmen but is stopped by Echo Kittle who has escaped from the Orlans in Radiance. She pleads with Seeker to help her defend the Glimmen from the Orlans but Seeker, knowing that he has little time left, refuses and carries on his way into the land cloud. There he kills five out of seven savanters but he is told to go back by a black figure, pretending to be his shadow. Seeker feels that something bad is happening at the Nom so he runs back as fast as he can. When Seeker arrives back at the Nom, the army of Orlans has already attacked and the charged water bomb ready to blow up the city, although Seeker doesn't know this. Seeker drives his power into the ground, causing an earthquake that stopped the battle in an instant, but the charged water bomb had already been launched at Anacrea and destroyed it, along with the Garden and the Lost Child. Seeker gets angry and takes revenge on the Jahan by breaking his pride, forcing him to kneel to Echo Kittle. The army of Orlans breaks up and Soren Similin dies from a charged water explosion. Seeker heads out in search of a purpose and runs across Jango, who is standing before a door. Jango says the door is open and he can enter if he wishes. Before he enters, he is told by Jango that there are many more Noms, and so he realizes the All and Only is not dead. The book is ended when Seeker enters the strange door next to Jango and enters an exact replica of the Nom's Garden that he was used to. He kneels down and asks for forgiveness for disbelieving in him after the destruction of the Nom.",
    " Mixing history and legend, it presents a situation in which pagan and Christianized Basques unite under the first king of Navarre and ally with Pelayo, the first king of Asturias to defend Catholic Iberia against the invading hordes of Islam. Amaya is a Christian noblewoman, daughter of a Basque woman and Ranimiro, the ruthless Visigoth general. She is a niece to pagan leader Amagoya, who prefers her other pagan niece as heiress to the secrets of Aitor, the Basque ancestral patriarch. Pacomio is a machinating Jew conspirating in disguise among Muslims, Visigoths and Basques. Eudes, duke of Cantabria, is Pacomio's son, but, by hiding his Jewish origin, has reached a high post in the Visigoth kingdom and aspires to power beyond what his allies and his father would allow. At the end, the secret of Aitor is revealed, to recommend Christianity, the pagan Basques (except for Amagoya) convert, and Amaya marries the Basque resistance leader, García, becoming the first monarchs of Navarre.

    " It is the story of a young Bengali man’s adventures in Africa in the years 1909-1910. Shankar, the protagonist, is a 20 year old man, recently graduated from college and about to take up a job in a jute mill, a prospect he absolutely loathes. He yearns for adventure, wild lands, forests and animals. He wants to follow the footsteps of famous explorers like Livingstone, Mungo Park, Marco Polo, all of whom he has read about and idolizes. By a stroke of luck, he secures a job as a clerk in Uganda Railways through a fellow villager already working there and goes to Africa without a second thought. There, he spends a few months laying rail tracks but soon encounters the first of many dangers of Pre-World War I Africa—man-eating lions. Later he takes up a job as station master in desolate station. Here he encounters the another hazard in Africa: the poisonous black mamba. He also rescues and looks after the middle-aged Portuguese explorer and gold prospector, Diego Alvarez. The encounter with Alavarez influences him deeply. Alavarez tells him of his earlier exploits and adventures, how he and his companion Jim Carter had braved deep jungles and mountains of Richtersveld to find the largest diamond mine. However, they were thwarted by the legendary Bunyip, a mythical monster which guards the mines which killed Carter. Shankar gives up his job and accompanies Alvarez as he decides to venture out once more and find the mines again. They meet with innumerable hardships, a raging volcano being the greatest challenge. Eventually they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by a mysterious monster, the same that had taken Carter’s life, the Bunyip. Shankar sets out to reach civilization. He finds the Bunyip's cave and the diamond mines by accident. He enters the cave but eventually gets lost. With great difficulty, he gets out, marking his way with \"pebbles\" and taking some back with him as memento, not knowing each is a piece of uncut diamond. He finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave he found earlier really was the diamond mine. Gatti, as Shankar learns from a note by him, had uncut diamonds in his boots. The note said that whoever reads the note can take the diamonds as long as he buries his skeleton, with Christian rites. Shankar does so, and keeps the old diamonds. He becomes lost in the deserts of Kalahari and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately he is rescued by a survey team, and taken to a hospital in Salisbury, Rhodesia, from where he sets sail for home. He ends the book saying that he will return to that cave one day with a large team, and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter and Gatti.",
    "Robert De Niro has completed a transatlantic box office double by topping the UK and US film charts with two different films at the same time.\nComedy sequel Meet the Fockers, in which he stars with Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, shot to the top of the UK chart at the weekend. It took £7.2m in three days - eight times more than the number two, Closer. Assault on Precinct 13 was in third. At the same time, US audiences were won over by his new thriller Hide and Seek. In Meet the Fockers, he picks up the role of an uptight father and ex-CIA agent from 2000 hit comedy, Meet the Parents.\nIt is a big leap to his role in Hide and Seek, a supernatural horror in which he plays a widower whose daughter's imaginary friend turns nasty. In the UK box office chart, Meet the Fockers pushed Closer off the top spot while police action movie Assault On Precinct 13, starring rapper Ja Rule, made £750,000 in its first weekend. London Underground thriller Creep was another new entry at six while quirky comedy Sideways, which got five Oscar nominations last week, entered in eighth place. The Oscar nominations do not seem to have had an impact on fans' choices at cinemas. Leading contenders The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Ray all suffered substantial drops in takings compared with the previous weekend.",
    "The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy (DOE) lab. DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The current top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocks up 35.86. Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.\nThe US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the Linpack benchmark. Until the official list is published, however, Blue Gene/L's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time.\nThe IBM Blue Gene/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005. Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance. This was achieved during internal testing at IBM's production facility in Rochester, Minnesota, though, so was not an official record. Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California. It would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October.\nSupercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis. IBM's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing. This means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second. \"When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world,\" Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.\n\"You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative.\" One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing - and Blue Gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding. \"Health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures. \"We are a great believer in simulation. It gives you another tool,\" he said. Once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. Compared with the current fastest supercomputers, Blue Gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.\nContrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon's Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"",
    "The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.\nCommission officials are to look at Rome's provision of a 400m euro ($495m; £275m) loan to the carrier. Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. The investigation could take up to 18 months. However, Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible. \"The Italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan,\" said Mr Barot. \"We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. I would like our analysis to be completed swiftly.\"\nThe matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. It plans to split into AZ Fly and AZ Services, which will handle air and ground services respectively. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. EU rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the \"one time, last time\" rule for airlines. Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. The airline declined to comment on the Commission decision.",
    "Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.\nThe Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be \"limited\". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and \"add-ons\" that the software giant offers.\nPeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.\nMicrosoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. \"It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,\" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. \"China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,\" said Mr Cluley.",
    "The debut of US television hit Desperate Housewives has helped lift Channel 4's January audience share by 12% compared to last year.\nOther successes such as Celebrity Big Brother and The Simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass BBC2 for the first month since last July. However the channel's share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with January 2004. Celebrity Big Brother attracted less viewers than its 2002 series.\nComedy drama Desperate Housewives managed to pull in five million viewers at one point during its run to date, attracting a quarter of the television audience. The two main television channels, BBC1 and ITV1, have both seen their monthly audience share decline in a year on year comparison for January, while Five's proportion remained the same at a slender 6.3%. Digital multi-channel TV is continuing to be the strongest area of growth, with the BBC reporting Freeview box ownership of five million, including one million sales in the last portion of 2004. Its share of the audience soared by 20% in January 2005 compared with last year, and currently stands at an average of 28.6%.",
    "Video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.\nGamers spent more than £1.34bn in 2004, almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the UK gaming industry's trade body. Sales records were smashed by the top title of the year GTA: San Andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character CJ into a crime boss. The game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. This feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the UK. Although only released in November the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. There were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies. Five titles, including Sony EyeToy Play and EA's Need for Speed: Underground 2, managed this feat according to figures compiled by Chart-Track for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (Elspa). Electronic Arts, the world's biggest games publisher, had 9 games in the top 20.\n2004 was a \"stellar year\" said Roger Bennett, director general of Elspa. \"In a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,\" he said. Part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. Halo, The Sims, Driver, Need for Speed, Fifa football, Burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. Despite this fondness for older games, Doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. Movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. Games linked to Shrek, The Incredibles, Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were all in the top 20. Elspa noted that sales of Xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. However, Sony's PlayStation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the £1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. Despite winning awards and rave reviews Half-Life 2 did not appear in the list. This was because it was only released on PC and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers. Also the novel distribution system adopted by developer Valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. Valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.",

    "French president Jacques Chirac has called the UK's £3bn rebate from the European Union \"unjustified\".\nSpeaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. He said it remained justified because less EU farm money came to the UK.\nMr Chirac told reporters in Brussels: \"One can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the British cheque. It can no longer be justified. It was from the past.\" But a UK Government official responded: \"Even with the rebate, the UK pays two and a half times more than France contributes to the EU budget. Without it we would pay 14 times as much as France. \"There can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.\"\nThe 25-member EU is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's Luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a June summit. Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a \"crucial test\" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain. EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.\nThe UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: \"I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.\n\"The UK is already one of the biggest net contributors to the EU .\" The foreign secretary meanwhile said the \"justice\" of the rebate remained. \"We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. \"That continues to be the case.\"\nUK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was \"set in stone\" and there was no reason to negotiate about it. \"It is extraordinary to do it at this time, just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the EU. If we lose our rebate as well, the British taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that I think everyone will go off the European project.\" EU leaders are holding talks in Brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish European economy. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is meeting his EU counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the European Constitution. The plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections. There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.\nMr Straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. \"European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,\" he said. \"What we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.\" Britain's low unemployment meant there was less \"neurosis\" about people coming from eastern European countries. \"In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in,\" he said.",
    "China lent Russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.\nThe Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk's former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\nThe embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country's richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China's thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it's a good deal for them too.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "(after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)\nJohn Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunez's header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after Mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.\nRiise could not have connected any better with Morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampard's powerfully-struck drive and Drogba's low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence.\nJoe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsen's header, then to smother William Gallas' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted Mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. Dudek saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, Drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from Glen Johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.\nDudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore (Biscan 67), Luis Garcia, Gerrard, Hamann, Riise, Kewell (Nunez 56), Morientes (Baros 74).\nSubs Not Used: Pellegrino, Carson.\nHyypia, Traore, Hamann, Carragher.\nRiise 1, Nunez 113.\nCech, Paulo Ferreira, Ricardo Carvalho, Terry, Gallas (Kezman 74), Jarosik (Gudjohnsen 45), Lampard, Makelele, Cole (Johnson 81), Drogba, Duff.\nSubs Not Used: Pidgeley, Tiago.\nLampard, Kezman, Drogba, Duff.\nGerrard 79 og, Drogba 107, Kezman 112.\n78,000\nS Bennett (Kent).",
    "The Conservative Party would deal \"sympathetically\" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.\nDr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for \"vindictiveness\" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.\nA jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.\nHe won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. \"I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. \"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.\"\nTory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. \"After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,\" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: \"I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial.\" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.",
    "Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced.\nEighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. \"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,\" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices.\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on midnight of 31 December. Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.",

    "Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday.

    "Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq in the wake of next Sunday's elections in the country, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\nIn a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of George W Bush, Mr Kennedy said Iraq had become a \"crucible of militant terrorism\". He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops \"as soon as the situation allows\", he said in London. Any exit strategy must \"augment and support\" the democratic process.\n\"There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,\" he said. \"There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.\" Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal \"regardless of the situation on the ground\".\nHe accused Mr Blair's government of \"being less than straightforward\" over its plans. \"Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,\" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech. \"He should set out a proper exit strategy, including the phased withdrawal of British troops, as the security situation allows.\" Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - \"especially Islamic countries\".",
    "Amelie Mauresmo and Maria Sharapova won their opening matches at the Tour Championships in Los Angeles.\nFrance's Mauresmo routed Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-0, while Wimbledon champion Sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. American Serena Williams also won, edging Russian Elena Dementieva 7-6 7-5 for her second victory of the event. The event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.\nMauresmo's win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot. Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front. \"Since then, I feel very confident on court and my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but it's very different than before I was number one. \"It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way.\" Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia's Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\n\"She got mad a little bit and I played some great tennis,\" said Mauresmo, who was runner-up to Kim Clijsters in last year's final. Zvonareva has lost both her games so far, having crashed 6-2 6-4 Kuznetsova in the Staples Centre on Wednesday. \"Sometimes not everything works,\" she said. \"It was lots of pressure. Maybe that is why I couldn't do 100%. But I was fighting.\" Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: \"In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. \"This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.\" The tournament debutant added: \"I love it here. The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It's hard to go out there and get it right but I'm fighting and I'm hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort.

Money raised will go to the Fondation pour l'Enfance (Foundation for Childhood) which aims to rebuild a children's shelter in Sri Lanka. Sir Elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his wife Anne-Aymone.

    "A Labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the Royal Family the same rights as males.\nThe legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the Crown. It would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. But the government refused to back Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill, saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.\nThe Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, agreed the 1701 Act of Settlement, which governs the succession, was discriminatory but added that \"for all practical purposes its effects are limited\".\nThe changes proposed by Lord Dubs were a \"complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues\", he said. Lord Falconer said there were 22 members of the Royal Family in the line of succession after the Prince of Wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. \"It is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. While we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn't the proper form,\" he added.\nHe did not rule out change in the future but said if Lord Dubs' private member's bill was passed by peers, he would urge MPs to oppose it in the Commons. Lord Dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the House of Lords, but urged the government to think again at a later stage. \"We cannot forever say we don't want to change things because it is too difficult,\" he told peers. During the debate, the Labour peer and former minister said: \"The monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. \"What we don't want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. \"We are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against Catholics.\" But opponents of the bill, including Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway and the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, said it would separate the state from both the Church of England and the Christian faith. Such a \"secular\" state would be markedly \"less tolerant\", Rt Rev Scott-Joynt argued.",
    "The UK' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election. Here's a guide to the plan:\nPeople coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of TB, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the European Union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.\nTuberculosis, Hepatitis B and HIV. A positive test for TB would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.\nPeople would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS. They would also, if appropriate, have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.\nPeople coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB. Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV.\nThe Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health. However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.\nThey claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. They also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into Britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. They say the plans will protect access to the NHS.\nApplicants will be tested in their home country. Only asylum seekers will be tested in the UK once their refugee status is established.\nHome Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries. Recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at Heathrow Airport and 10,000 at Gatwick. From those tests, about 100 infectious cases of TB were found.\nThe Tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. The party has looked at the way the system is operated in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Tory proposals are \"quite closely modelled\" on the New Zealand system.\nLabour claims the policy is little more than a \"desperate attempt to catch up with Labour's five-year plan\" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. This says health screening for TB will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. The Liberal Democrats have warned Labour and the Tories they were \"in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it\".",
    "Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.\nLG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card's plastic for purchases.\nLG Card's creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.\n\"Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,\" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm's major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants \"fair and reasonable guidelines\" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. \"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,\" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.\nLG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. \"Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,\" said Mr Kim.",
    "Plans to portray Dominica's Carib Indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film Pirates of the Caribbean have been criticised by the group's chief.\nCarib Chief Charles Williams said talks with Disney's producers revealed there was \"a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed\". The Caribbean island's government said Disney planned to film in Dominica. The Caribs have long denied their ancestors practised cannibalism. Disney was unavailable for comment. \"Our ancestors stood up against early European conquerors and because they stood up...we were labelled savages and cannibals up to today,\" said Mr Williams.\n\"This cannot be perpetuated in movies.\" Shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in April, with hundreds of Dominicans applying to be extras in the movie.\nAbout 3,000 Caribs live on the island of Dominica, which has a population of 70,000. Many Caribs were killed by disease and war during colonisation up to the 1600s. Mr Williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film. But he admitted there were some members of the Carib council who did not support the campaign. He said some did not \"understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the Carib people\".

She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.\n\"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,\" White said in the LA Times. \"Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product.\" White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case. The 27-year-old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning. \"I have no clue what it's going to take to change that,\" said White. \"I would say I made a mistake and I would never, ever go back. \"I would never recommend anyone to take that route.\"",
    "Tony Blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on Monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 May.\nThe date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. Over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day Mr Blair would go for an historic third term. And the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. The prime minister and his campaign boss Alan Milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between Labour's stability and investment against Tory cuts and boom and bust.\nAnd Chancellor Gordon Brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in Westminster - to underline that economic message. And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.\nDuring the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labour's plans was a cut. And it looked like the Labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by Mr Howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger \"cuts\".\nHe was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track. A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again. Mr Brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. As usual, the Liberal Democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. But leader Charles Kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. Other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on Iraq, law and order and education, for example. But, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. And, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001's non-event.",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "Celtic's Neil Lennon admits Rangers could be considered \"slight favourites\" for the Old Firm CIS Cup clash, but insists his side can still win.\nLennon concedes Rangers are in good form at the moment, but they have failed to beat Celtic in their last seven meetings. \"Rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks,\" he said. \"But it's a game we believe we're capable of winning if we play our best,\" he told the Evening Times. \"All the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in. \"Without playing at the top of our game, we have still been winning matches. \"At the minute, we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in Europe, so I don't think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out. \"Of course, it is a concern when you are losing goals, because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets, but hopefully we are over that wee run. \"Considering we lost Henrik Larsson at the end of last season, we have still been scoring a lot of goals, which is pleasing.\"",
    "US retail giant Federated Department Stores is to buy rival May Department Stores for $11bn (£5.7bn).\nThe deal will bring together famous stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's, creating the largest department store chain in the US. The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn. The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's - will assume $6bn of May's debt, bringing the deal's total value to $17bn. Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.\nMay has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart. Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.\n\"We have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in America, creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence,\" said Terry Lundgren, Federated's chairman. Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May. \"Without this deal May would have been, to put it bluntly, washed up,\" said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May's yearly sales are $14.4bn.",
    "Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.\nBrian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination. But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O'Neill's first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would \"desperately like to stay at Celtic\" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.\nThe agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old's father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho's father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. \"I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn't want to go there,\" said Hassel. \"He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic.\" Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. \"It was a thought at one stage,\" he said. \"If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. \"He is a fan of Kevin Keegan's style of play. It would not be a bad move for him.\" Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: \"The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened. \"If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. \"If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes.\" The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O'Neill since his move to Celtic Park. \"I can't understand why I am in this situation,\" he continued. \"When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support.\"",
    "Oscar-winner Andrea Arnold has been congratulated by the UK Film Council, the organisation which partly funded her project.\nArnold's film Wasp won the best live action short film award on Sunday. \"The UK Film Council spends millions of pounds of lottery investment on short filmmaking in Britain every year,\" said chief executive officer John Woodward. \"It certainly pays off when you see new film-makers winning such prestigious awards,\" he added.\nWasp, which was commissioned by the Film Council and Channel 4, beat films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar to the prize. It stars actress Nathalie Press, who appeared in the Bafta-winning drama My Summer Of Love, as a single mother who is forced to take drastic action when she is invited on a date and is unable to find a babysitter to look after her four daughters. The film has already won over 30 other international awards including the Sundance Short Film Prize. Arnold, from Dartford in Kent, described her victory as \"truly overwhelming. I'm really not used to this kind of thing,\" she said, after receiving her Oscar from actor Jeremy Irons. \"Thanks to everyone who worked on this - the beers are on me when we get home.\" The director was one of only two British winners on the night, the other being Sandy Powell, who won the costume design Oscar for her work on The Aviator.",
    "The last film to be made by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, called 06/05, has been premiered in The Hague.\nMembers of Van Gogh's family and celebrities attended the screening of 06/05, based on the murder of the anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam six weeks ago. A Dutch-Moroccan man suspected of radical Islamist links has been charged. The killing, and Fortuyn's death in 2002, convulsed the Netherlands. Many Dutch people have questioned their country's self-image as a peaceful, tolerant nation in the wake of the murders, which triggered heated debate about immigration.\nAn animal rights activist was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year for killing Fortuyn. Earlier this year, Van Gogh made a film accusing Islam of promoting violence against women. It caused outrage among Muslims and death threats were made against him. The film 06/05 will become available on the internet on Wednesday and go on general release in Dutch cinemas in January. Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician. The story unfolds through the eyes of a freelance photographer who unwittingly takes pictures revealing the involvement of Dutch authorities in Fortuyn's murder. Photographer Jim de Booy then goes on the run from secret service agents who burgle his home and threaten his family.",
    "The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\nThe Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.",
    "The world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.\nThe Wolong Nature Reserve in the Sichuan Province of southwest China is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world. A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. The data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. The reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.\nUsing the network, vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival.\n\"Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world,\" said Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong Nature Reserve. \"Our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings.\" The network has been developed by Intel, working closely with the staff at Wolong. It includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.\nBefore the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park, staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. Infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. To foster cultural links across the globe, a children's learning lab has been incorporated in the network, in collaboration with Globio (Federation for Global Biodiversity Education for Children), an international non-profit organisation. It will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in Portland, Oregon in the US. \"Digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world,\" said Globio founder Gerry Ellis.",
    "The shape of the UK's economy In graphics\nBut he denied that he was ruling out British membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year. Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future. Otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of China, he told MPs.\nThe chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.\nUnder Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules \"make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure\". But he argued that the EU was moving in the direction of the UK principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. Under Mr Brown's \"sustainable investment\" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.\nMr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified £3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only £6bn. Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter. But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was \"impugning the integrity\" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. Mr Brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost Treasury coffers.\nEarlier, ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more \"rigid\" rules. But fellow Tory David Heathcoat-Amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run Europe's varied economies on one set of rules. \"The essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake,\" he said. \"The warning is about the European constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. It gives more powers to Brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy.\" But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. \"The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,\" Mr. Brown said.",
    "A call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labour's most senior Asians.\nShahid Malik, who is on Labour's ruling NEC, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.\nMr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. \"If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,\" he said. He added: \"It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn't have a minority candidate.\" Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.\nBut he argued: \"I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.\" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as \"painful\". \"I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn't worked,\" she said. \"The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people.\" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation. \"We haven't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,\" he said.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "The stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End.\nSir Cameron Mackintosh's lavish production, which has cost £9m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress Laura Michelle Kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny's trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musical's premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.\nThe show's director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.",
    "A British author has had the film rights to her children's bestseller snapped up for a seven-figure sum, with Ridley Scott set to direct.\nMichelle Paver's Wolf Brother, a fantasy set 6,000 years ago, is the first in a planned series of six books. Film studio Fox has bought the rights for around $4m (£2.13m) for Scott's company Scott Free to develop. The director said he was \"thrilled\" with the project. \"Wolf Brother is an enchanting book,\" he said. Paver, who lives in London and previously worked as a lawyer, began writing the book in 1982 while studying biochemistry at Oxford University.\nShe was an established author of love stories when she turned the work-in-progress into a children's novel. It was published in 2004, with Paver earning an advance of $5m (£2.8m) - the highest sum ever paid for a debut children's book. Wolf Brother tells the story of Torak, a 12-year-old hunter who lives in the forest. After his father is killed he teams up with a wolf cub and sets out to rid the forest of an evil force. Paver is currently writing the second book in the series. \"Michelle Paver lives and breathes the worlds she writes about,\" said a spokesman for the author. \"I've told her about the film deal but at the moment she is writing the second book and her mind is 6000 years away deep in the primeval forest.\"",
    "The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit.\nAnalysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. However, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\nThe dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.\nDisappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected. \"There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday,\" said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel. At the same time, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. Investors will now look towards February's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in London for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar's decline.",
    "The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US.\nNew Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine.\nIn a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April.",

Get Me Out of Here drew an average of 10.9m viewers - about four million fewer than the previous series.\nThe fourth series of the show peaked on Monday at 11.9m and 49.2% of the audience, just before Joe Pasquale won. This compared with a peak of 15.3m at and a record 62.2% of the TV audience when Kerry McFadden won in February. Comic Pasquale beat former Royal butler Paul Burrell who came second, nightclub owner Fran Cosgrave, who was third. Pasquale follows Kerry McFadden, Phil Tufnell and Tony Blackburn as winners of the show.\nSinger and TV presenter McFadden was the show's first female winner. When cricketer Phil Tufnell won in May 2003, 12.3 million people - 50% of the viewing public - tuned in to watch. And when Tony Blackburn won the first show in 2002, 10.9 million people saw the show. Pasquale had been the show's hottest ever favourite to win, and its hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, known as Ant and Dec, said Monday's deciding vote was the closest in the programme's history.\nPascuale has been flooded with offers of TV work, according to his management company, but one of his first jobs on his return is pantomime.\nBefore joining I'm a Celebrity, he had signed up to play Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk in Birmingham, and tickets for the show have become increasingly popular since he joined the TV show.

The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.",
    "An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries.\nArash Sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online \"day of action\" to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger, Motjaba Saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests, is still being held.\nA spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as \"harsh\" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. \"The authorities are trying to make an example of him,\" the organisation said in a statement.\n\"By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media.\" In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the BBC Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court \"illegal and incompetent\" and called for a retrial in a public court.\nMr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world.\nThe Committee to Protect Bloggers designated 22 February 2005 as Free Mojtaba and Arash Day. Around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. About 12% of users were based in Iran, the campaign's director told the BBC News website. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. \"The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi's sentence, not less. \"The mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.\"",
    "Newcastle manager Graeme Souness is closing in on signing Chelsea defender Celestine Babayaro when the transfer window reopens.\nSouness is bidding to bolster his defence and, according to reports, contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player. Babayaro has been in the Premiership since 1997 when he moved to Chelsea for £2.25m from Anderlecht. But the 26-year-old has been surplus to requirements this season. Souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players.\nBut he said: \"All I can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals. \"We have said from day one we want to strengthen, and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks.\"",
    "In a sign of a thaw in relations between Egypt and Israel, the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the US, allowing Egyptian goods made in partnership with Israeli firms free access to American markets.\nThe protocol, signed in Cairo, will establish what are called \"qualified industrial zones\" in Egypt. Products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the US, provided that 35% of their components are the product of Israeli-Egyptian cooperation. The US describes this as the most important economic agreement between Egypt and Israel in two decades.\nThe protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. There has been deep sensitivity in Egypt about any form of co-operation with Israel as long as its peace process with the Palestinians remains blocked. But in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. Both exchanged prisoners earlier this month, with Egypt handing back an Israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak has described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as the best chance for the Palestinians to achieve peace. The government in Cairo now believes Mr Sharon is moving towards the centre and away from the positions of right wing groups. It also believes the US, pressed by Europe, is now more willing to engage seriously in the search for a settlement. But there are also pressing economic reasons for Egypt's decision to enter into the trade agreement. It will give a huge boost to Egyptian textile exports, which are about to suffer a drop after new regulations come into force in the US at the beginning of the year.",
    "Life insurer Axa Sun Life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors.\nRegular annual bonus rates on former Axa Equity & Law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. Axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. The cut will hit an estimated 3% of Axa's policyholders. The rest will know their fate in March.\nThe cuts on Axa's policies will mean a policyholder who had invested £50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of £46,998. This equated to a annual investment growth rate of 8% Axa said. With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. However, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. \"The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,\" Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News. Axa cut payouts for the same investors last January.",

Awake,\nMy fairest, my espoused, my latest found,\nHeaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!\nAwake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field\nCalls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring\nOur tender plants, how blows the citron grove,\nWhat drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,\nHow nature paints her colours, how the bee\nSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.\nSuch whispering waked her, but with startled eye\nOn Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.\nO sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,\nMy glory, my perfection! glad I see\nThy face, and morn returned; for I this night\n(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,\nIf dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,\nWorks of day past, or morrow's next design,\nBut of offence and trouble, which my mind\nKnew never till this irksome night:  Methought,\nClose at mine ear one called me forth to walk\nWith gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said,\n'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,\n'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields\n'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake\n'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns\n'Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light\n'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,\n'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,\n'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?\n'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment\n'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.'\nI rose as at thy call, but found thee not;\nTo find thee I directed then my walk;\nAnd on, methought, alone I passed through ways\nThat brought me on a sudden to the tree\nOf interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,\nMuch fairer to my fancy than by day:\nAnd, as I wondering looked, beside it stood\nOne shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven\nBy us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled\nAmbrosia; on that tree he also gazed;\nAnd 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged,\n'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,\n'Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?\n'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?\n'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold\n'Longer thy offered good; why else set here?\nThis said, he paused not, but with venturous arm\nHe plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled\nAt such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:\nBut he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine,\n'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,\n'Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit\n'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:\n'And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more\n'Communicated, more abundant grows,\n'The author not impaired, but honoured more?\n'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!\n'Partake thou also; happy though thou art,\n'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:\n'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods\n'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,\n'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes\n'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see\n'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!'\nSo saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,\nEven to my mouth of that same fruit held part\nWhich he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell\nSo quickened appetite, that I, methought,\nCould not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds\nWith him I flew, and underneath beheld\nThe earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide\nAnd various:  Wondering at my flight and change\nTo this high exaltation; suddenly\nMy guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,\nAnd fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked\nTo find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night\nRelated, and thus Adam answered sad.\nBest image of myself, and dearer half,\nThe trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep\nAffects me equally; nor can I like\nThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;\nYet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,\nCreated pure.  But know that in the soul\nAre many lesser faculties, that serve\nReason as chief; among these Fancy next\nHer office holds; of all external things\nWhich the five watchful senses represent,\nShe forms imaginations, aery shapes,\nWhich Reason, joining or disjoining, frames\nAll what we affirm or what deny, and call\nOur knowledge or opinion; then retires\nInto her private cell, when nature rests.\nOft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes\nTo imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,\nWild work produces oft, and most in dreams;\nIll matching words and deeds long past or late.\nSome such resemblances, methinks, I find\nOf our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,\nBut with addition strange; yet be not sad.\nEvil into the mind of God or Man\nMay come and go, so unreproved, and leave\nNo spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope\nThat what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,\nWaking thou never will consent to do.\nBe not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,\nThat wont to be more cheerful and serene,\nThan when fair morning first smiles on the world;\nAnd let us to our fresh employments rise\nAmong the groves, the fountains, and the flowers\nThat open now their choisest bosomed smells,\nReserved from night, and kept for thee in store.\nSo cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;\nBut silently a gentle tear let fall\nFrom either eye, and wiped them with her hair;\nTwo other precious drops that ready stood,\nEach in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell\nKissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse\nAnd pious awe, that feared to have offended.\nSo all was cleared, and to the field they haste.\nBut first, from under shady arborous roof\nSoon as they forth were come to open sight\nOf day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,\nWith wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,\nShot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,\nDiscovering in wide landskip all the east\nOf Paradise and Eden's happy plains,\nLowly they bowed adoring, and began\nTheir orisons, each morning duly paid\nIn various style; for neither various style\nNor holy rapture wanted they to praise\nTheir Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung\nUnmeditated; such prompt eloquence\nFlowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,\nMore tuneable than needed lute or harp\nTo add more sweetness; and they thus began.\nThese are thy glorious works, Parent of good,\nAlmighty!  Thine this universal frame,\nThus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!\nUnspeakable, who sitst above these heavens\nTo us invisible, or dimly seen\nIn these thy lowest works; yet these declare\nThy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.\nSpeak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,\nAngels; for ye behold him, and with songs\nAnd choral symphonies, day without night,\nCircle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven\nOn Earth join all ye Creatures to extol\nHim first, him last, him midst, and without end.\nFairest of stars, last in the train of night,\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn,\nSure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn\nWith thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,\nWhile day arises, that sweet hour of prime.\nThou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,\nAcknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise\nIn thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,\nAnd when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.\nMoon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,\nWith the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;\nAnd ye five other wandering Fires, that move\nIn mystick dance not without song, resound\nHis praise, who out of darkness called up light.\nAir, and ye Elements, the eldest birth\nOf Nature's womb, that in quaternion run\nPerpetual circle, multiform; and mix\nAnd nourish all things; let your ceaseless change\nVary to our great Maker still new praise.\nYe Mists and Exhalations, that now rise\nFrom hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,\nTill the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,\nIn honour to the world's great Author rise;\nWhether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,\nOr wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,\nRising or falling still advance his praise.\nHis praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,\nBreathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,\nWith every plant, in sign of worship wave.\nFountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,\nMelodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.\nJoin voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,\nThat singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,\nBear on your wings and in your notes his praise.\nYe that in waters glide, and ye that walk\nThe earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;\nWitness if I be silent, morn or even,\nTo hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,\nMade vocal by my song, and taught his praise.\nHail, universal Lord, be bounteous still\nTo give us only good; and if the night\nHave gathered aught of evil, or concealed,\nDisperse it, as now light dispels the dark!\nSo prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts\nFirm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.\nOn to their morning's rural work they haste,\nAmong sweet dews and flowers; where any row\nOf fruit-trees over-woody reached too far\nTheir pampered boughs, and needed hands to check\nFruitless embraces: or they led the vine\nTo wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines\nHer marriageable arms, and with him brings\nHer dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn\nHis barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld\nWith pity Heaven's high King, and to him called\nRaphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned\nTo travel with Tobias, and secured\nHis marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.\nRaphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth\nSatan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,\nHath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed\nThis night the human pair; how he designs\nIn them at once to ruin all mankind.\nGo therefore, half this day as friend with friend\nConverse with Adam, in what bower or shade\nThou findest him from the heat of noon retired,\nTo respite his day-labour with repast,\nOr with repose; and such discourse bring on,\nAs may advise him of his happy state,\nHappiness in his power left free to will,\nLeft to his own free will, his will though free,\nYet mutable; whence warn him to beware\nHe swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal\nHis danger, and from whom; what enemy,\nLate fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now\nThe fall of others from like state of bliss;\nBy violence? no, for that shall be withstood;\nBut by deceit and lies:  This let him know,\nLest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend\nSurprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.\nSo spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled\nAll justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint\nAfter his charge received; but from among\nThousand celestial Ardours, where he stood\nVeiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,\nFlew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,\nOn each hand parting, to his speed gave way\nThrough all the empyreal road; till, at the gate\nOf Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide\nOn golden hinges turning, as by work\nDivine the sovran Architect had framed.\nFrom hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,\nStar interposed, however small he sees,\nNot unconformed to other shining globes,\nEarth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned\nAbove all hills.  As when by night the glass\nOf Galileo, less assured, observes\nImagined lands and regions in the moon:\nOr pilot, from amidst the Cyclades\nDelos or Samos first appearing, kens\nA cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight\nHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\nSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing\nNow on the polar winds, then with quick fan\nWinnows the buxom air; till, within soar\nOf towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems\nA phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,\nWhen, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's\nBright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.\nAt once on the eastern cliff of Paradise\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\nA Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade\nHis lineaments divine; the pair that clad\nEach shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast\nWith regal ornament; the middle pair\nGirt like a starry zone his waist, and round\nSkirted his loins and thighs with downy gold\nAnd colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet\nShadowed from either heel with feathered mail,\nSky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood,\nAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled\nThe circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands\nOf Angels under watch; and to his state,\nAnd to his message high, in honour rise;\nFor on some message high they guessed him bound.\nTheir glittering tents he passed, and now is come\nInto the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,\nAnd flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;\nA wilderness of sweets; for Nature here\nWantoned as in her prime, and played at will\nHer virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,\nWild above rule or art, enormous bliss.\nHim through the spicy forest onward come\nAdam discerned, as in the door he sat\nOf his cool bower, while now the mounted sun\nShot down direct his fervid rays to warm\nEarth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:\nAnd Eve within, due at her hour prepared\nFor dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please\nTrue appetite, and not disrelish thirst\nOf nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,\nBerry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called.\nHaste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold\nEastward among those trees, what glorious shape\nComes this way moving; seems another morn\nRisen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven\nTo us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe\nThis day to be our guest.  But go with speed,\nAnd, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour\nAbundance, fit to honour and receive\nOur heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford\nOur givers their own gifts, and large bestow\nFrom large bestowed, where Nature multiplies\nHer fertile growth, and by disburthening grows\nMore fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.\nTo whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould,\nOf God inspired! small store will serve, where store,\nAll seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;\nSave what by frugal storing firmness gains\nTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:\nBut I will haste, and from each bough and brake,\nEach plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice\nTo entertain our Angel-guest, as he\nBeholding shall confess, that here on Earth\nGod hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.\nSo saying, with dispatchful looks in haste\nShe turns, on hospitable thoughts intent\nWhat choice to choose for delicacy best,\nWhat order, so contrived as not to mix\nTastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring\nTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change;\nBestirs her then, and from each tender stalk\nWhatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields\nIn India East or West, or middle shore\nIn Pontus or the Punick coast, or where\nAlcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat\nRough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,\nShe gathers, tribute large, and on the board\nHeaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape\nShe crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths\nFrom many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed\nShe tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold\nWants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground\nWith rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.\nMean while our primitive great sire, to meet\nHis God-like guest, walks forth, without more train\nAccompanied than with his own complete\nPerfections; in himself was all his state,\nMore solemn than the tedious pomp that waits\nOn princes, when their rich retinue long\nOf horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,\nDazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.\nNearer his presence Adam, though not awed,\nYet with submiss approach and reverence meek,\nAs to a superiour nature bowing low,\nThus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place\nNone can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;\nSince, by descending from the thrones above,\nThose happy places thou hast deigned a while\nTo want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us\nTwo only, who yet by sovran gift possess\nThis spacious ground, in yonder shady bower\nTo rest; and what the garden choicest bears\nTo sit and taste, till this meridian heat\nBe over, and the sun more cool decline.\nWhom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.\nAdam, I therefore came; nor art thou such\nCreated, or such place hast here to dwell,\nAs may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,\nTo visit thee; lead on then where thy bower\nO'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,\nI have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge\nThey came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,\nWith flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,\nUndecked save with herself, more lovely fair\nThan Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned\nOf three that in mount Ida naked strove,\nStood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil\nShe needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm\nAltered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail\nBestowed, the holy salutation used\nLong after to blest Mary, second Eve.\nHail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb\nShall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,\nThan with these various fruits the trees of God\nHave heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf\nTheir table was, and mossy seats had round,\nAnd on her ample square from side to side\nAll autumn piled, though spring and autumn here\nDanced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;\nNo fear lest dinner cool; when thus began\nOur author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste\nThese bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom\nAll perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,\nTo us for food and for delight hath caused\nThe earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps\nTo spiritual natures; only this I know,\nThat one celestial Father gives to all.\nTo whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives\n(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part\nSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be found\nNo ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure\nIntelligential substances require,\nAs doth your rational; and both contain\nWithin them every lower faculty\nOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,\nTasting concoct, digest, assimilate,\nAnd corporeal to incorporeal turn.\nFor know, whatever was created, needs\nTo be sustained and fed:  Of elements\nThe grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\nEarth and the sea feed air, the air those fires\nEthereal, and as lowest first the moon;\nWhence in her visage round those spots, unpurged\nVapours not yet into her substance turned.\nNor doth the moon no nourishment exhale\nFrom her moist continent to higher orbs.\nThe sun that light imparts to all, receives\nFrom all his alimental recompence\nIn humid exhalations, and at even\nSups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees\nOf life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines\nYield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn\nWe brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground\nCovered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here\nVaried his bounty so with new delights,\nAs may compare with Heaven; and to taste\nThink not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,\nAnd to their viands fell; nor seemingly\nThe Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss\nOf Theologians; but with keen dispatch\nOf real hunger, and concoctive heat\nTo transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires\nThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire\nOf sooty coal the empirick alchemist\nCan turn, or holds it possible to turn,\nMetals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,\nAs from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve\nMinistered naked, and their flowing cups\nWith pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence\nDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,\nThen had the sons of God excuse to have been\nEnamoured at that sight; but in those hearts\nLove unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy\nWas understood, the injured lover's hell.\nThus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,\nNot burdened nature, sudden mind arose\nIn Adam, not to let the occasion pass\nGiven him by this great conference to know\nOf things above his world, and of their being\nWho dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw\nTranscend his own so far; whose radiant forms,\nDivine effulgence, whose high power, so far\nExceeded human; and his wary speech\nThus to the empyreal minister he framed.\nInhabitant with God, now know I well\nThy favour, in this honour done to Man;\nUnder whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed\nTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,\nFood not of Angels, yet accepted so,\nAs that more willingly thou couldst not seem\nAt Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare\nTo whom the winged Hierarch replied.\nO Adam, One Almighty is, from whom\nAll things proceed, and up to him return,\nIf not depraved from good, created all\nSuch to perfection, one first matter all,\nEndued with various forms, various degrees\nOf substance, and, in things that live, of life;\nBut more refined, more spiritous, and pure,\nAs nearer to him placed, or nearer tending\nEach in their several active spheres assigned,\nTill body up to spirit work, in bounds\nProportioned to each kind.  So from the root\nSprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves\nMore aery, last the bright consummate flower\nSpirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,\nMan's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,\nTo vital spirits aspire, to animal,\nTo intellectual; give both life and sense,\nFancy and understanding; whence the soul\nReason receives, and reason is her being,\nDiscursive, or intuitive; discourse\nIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours,\nDiffering but in degree, of kind the same.\nWonder not then, what God for you saw good\nIf I refuse not, but convert, as you\nTo proper substance.  Time may come, when Men\nWith Angels may participate, and find\nNo inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;\nAnd from these corporal nutriments perhaps\nYour bodies may at last turn all to spirit,\nImproved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend\nEthereal, as we; or may, at choice,\nHere or in heavenly Paradises dwell;\nIf ye be found obedient, and retain\nUnalterably firm his love entire,\nWhose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy\nYour fill what happiness this happy state\nCan comprehend, incapable of more.\nTo whom the patriarch of mankind replied.\nO favourable Spirit, propitious guest,\nWell hast thou taught the way that might direct\nOur knowledge, and the scale of nature set\nFrom center to circumference; whereon,\nIn contemplation of created things,\nBy steps we may ascend to God.  But say,\nWhat meant that caution joined, If ye be found\nObedient?  Can we want obedience then\nTo him, or possibly his love desert,\nWho formed us from the dust and placed us here\nFull to the utmost measure of what bliss\nHuman desires can seek or apprehend?\nTo whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth,\nAttend!  That thou art happy, owe to God;\nThat thou continuest such, owe to thyself,\nThat is, to thy obedience; therein stand.\nThis was that caution given thee; be advised.\nGod made thee perfect, not immutable;\nAnd good he made thee, but to persevere\nHe left it in thy power; ordained thy will\nBy nature free, not over-ruled by fate\nInextricable, or strict necessity:\nOur voluntary service he requires,\nNot our necessitated; such with him\nFinds no acceptance, nor can find; for how\nCan hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve\nWilling or no, who will but what they must\nBy destiny, and can no other choose?\nMyself, and all the angelick host, that stand\nIn sight of God, enthroned, our happy state\nHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;\nOn other surety none:  Freely we serve,\nBecause we freely love, as in our will\nTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:\nAnd some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,\nAnd so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall\nFrom what high state of bliss, into what woe!\nTo whom our great progenitor.  Thy words\nAttentive, and with more delighted ear,\nDivine instructer, I have heard, than when\nCherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills\nAereal musick send:  Nor knew I not\nTo be both will and deed created free;\nYet that we never shall forget to love\nOur Maker, and obey him whose command\nSingle is yet so just, my constant thoughts\nAssured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest\nHath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,\nBut more desire to hear, if thou consent,\nThe full relation, which must needs be strange,\nWorthy of sacred silence to be heard;\nAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the sun\nHath finished half his journey, and scarce begins\nHis other half in the great zone of Heaven.\nThus Adam made request; and Raphael,\nAfter short pause assenting, thus began.\nHigh matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,\nSad task and hard:  For how shall I relate\nTo human sense the invisible exploits\nOf warring Spirits? how, without remorse,\nThe ruin of so many glorious once\nAnd perfect while they stood? how last unfold\nThe secrets of another world, perhaps\nNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy good\nThis is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach\nOf human sense, I shall delineate so,\nBy likening spiritual to corporal forms,\nAs may express them best; though what if Earth\nBe but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein\nEach to other like, more than on earth is thought?\nAs yet this world was not, and Chaos wild\nReigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests\nUpon her center poised; when on a day\n(For time, though in eternity, applied\nTo motion, measures all things durable\nBy present, past, and future,) on such day\nAs Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host\nOf Angels by imperial summons called,\nInnumerable before the Almighty's throne\nForthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared\nUnder their Hierarchs in orders bright:\nTen thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,\nStandards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear\nStream in the air, and for distinction serve\nOf hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;\nOr in their glittering tissues bear imblazed\nHoly memorials, acts of zeal and love\nRecorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs\nOf circuit inexpressible they stood,\nOrb within orb, the Father Infinite,\nBy whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,\nAmidst as from a flaming mount, whose top\nBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.\nHear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nHear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.\nThis day I have begot whom I declare\nMy only Son, and on this holy hill\nHim have anointed, whom ye now behold\nAt my right hand; your head I him appoint;\nAnd by myself have sworn, to him shall bow\nAll knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:\nUnder his great vice-gerent reign abide\nUnited, as one individual soul,\nFor ever happy:  Him who disobeys,\nMe disobeys, breaks union, and that day,\nCast out from God and blessed vision, falls\nInto utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place\nOrdained without redemption, without end.\nSo spake the Omnipotent, and with his words\nAll seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.\nThat day, as other solemn days, they spent\nIn song and dance about the sacred hill;\nMystical dance, which yonder starry sphere\nOf planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels\nResembles nearest, mazes intricate,\nEccentrick, intervolved, yet regular\nThen most, when most irregular they seem;\nAnd in their motions harmony divine\nSo smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear\nListens delighted.  Evening now approached,\n(For we have also our evening and our morn,\nWe ours for change delectable, not need;)\nForthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn\nDesirous; all in circles as they stood,\nTables are set, and on a sudden piled\nWith Angels food, and rubied nectar flows\nIn pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,\nFruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.\nOn flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,\nThey eat, they drink, and in communion sweet\nQuaff immortality and joy, secure\nOf surfeit, where full measure only bounds\nExcess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered\nWith copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.\nNow when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled\nFrom that high mount of God, whence light and shade\nSpring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed\nTo grateful twilight, (for night comes not there\nIn darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed\nAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;\nWide over all the plain, and wider far\nThan all this globous earth in plain outspread,\n(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,\nDispersed in bands and files, their camp extend\nBy living streams among the trees of life,\nPavilions numberless, and sudden reared,\nCelestial tabernacles, where they slept\nFanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,\nMelodious hymns about the sovran throne\nAlternate all night long: but not so waked\nSatan; so call him now, his former name\nIs heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,\nIf not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,\nIn favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught\nWith envy against the Son of God, that day\nHonoured by his great Father, and proclaimed\nMessiah King anointed, could not bear\nThrough pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.\nDeep malice thence conceiving and disdain,\nSoon as midnight brought on the dusky hour\nFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved\nWith all his legions to dislodge, and leave\nUnworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,\nContemptuous; and his next subordinate\nAwakening, thus to him in secret spake.\nSleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close\nThy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree\nOf yesterday, so late hath passed the lips\nOf Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts\nWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;\nBoth waking we were one; how then can now\nThy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed;\nNew laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise\nIn us who serve, new counsels to debate\nWhat doubtful may ensue:  More in this place\nTo utter is not safe.  Assemble thou\nOf all those myriads which we lead the chief;\nTell them, that by command, ere yet dim night\nHer shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,\nAnd all who under me their banners wave,\nHomeward, with flying march, where we possess\nThe quarters of the north; there to prepare\nFit entertainment to receive our King,\nThe great Messiah, and his new commands,\nWho speedily through all the hierarchies\nIntends to pass triumphant, and give laws.\nSo spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused\nBad influence into the unwary breast\nOf his associate:  He together calls,\nOr several one by one, the regent Powers,\nUnder him Regent; tells, as he was taught,\nThat the Most High commanding, now ere night,\nNow ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,\nThe great hierarchal standard was to move;\nTells the suggested cause, and casts between\nAmbiguous words and jealousies, to sound\nOr taint integrity:  But all obeyed\nThe wonted signal, and superiour voice\nOf their great Potentate; for great indeed\nHis name, and high was his degree in Heaven;\nHis countenance, as the morning-star that guides\nThe starry flock, allured them, and with lies\nDrew after him the third part of Heaven's host.\nMean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns\nAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,\nAnd from within the golden lamps that burn\nNightly before him, saw without their light\nRebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread\nAmong the sons of morn, what multitudes\nWere banded to oppose his high decree;\nAnd, smiling, to his only Son thus said.\nSon, thou in whom my glory I behold\nIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,\nNearly it now concerns us to be sure\nOf our Omnipotence, and with what arms\nWe mean to hold what anciently we claim\nOf deity or empire:  Such a foe\nIs rising, who intends to erect his throne\nEqual to ours, throughout the spacious north;\nNor so content, hath in his thought to try\nIn battle, what our power is, or our right.\nLet us advise, and to this hazard draw\nWith speed what force is left, and all employ\nIn our defence; lest unawares we lose\nThis our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.\nTo whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,\nLightning divine, ineffable, serene,\nMade answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes\nJustly hast in derision, and, secure,\nLaughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,\nMatter to me of glory, whom their hate\nIllustrates, when they see all regal power\nGiven me to quell their pride, and in event\nKnow whether I be dextrous to subdue\nThy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.\nSo spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,\nFar was advanced on winged speed; an host\nInnumerable as the stars of night,\nOr stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun\nImpearls on every leaf and every flower.\nRegions they passed, the mighty regencies\nOf Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,\nIn their triple degrees; regions to which\nAll thy dominion, Adam, is no more\nThan what this garden is to all the earth,\nAnd all the sea, from one entire globose\nStretched into longitude; which having passed,\nAt length into the limits of the north\nThey came; and Satan to his royal seat\nHigh on a hill, far blazing, as a mount\nRaised on a mount, with pyramids and towers\nFrom diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;\nThe palace of great Lucifer, (so call\nThat structure in the dialect of men\nInterpreted,) which not long after, he\nAffecting all equality with God,\nIn imitation of that mount whereon\nMessiah was declared in sight of Heaven,\nThe Mountain of the Congregation called;\nFor thither he assembled all his train,\nPretending so commanded to consult\nAbout the great reception of their King,\nThither to come, and with calumnious art\nOf counterfeited truth thus held their ears.\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nIf these magnifick titles yet remain\nNot merely titular, since by decree\nAnother now hath to himself engrossed\nAll power, and us eclipsed under the name\nOf King anointed, for whom all this haste\nOf midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,\nThis only to consult how we may best,\nWith what may be devised of honours new,\nReceive him coming to receive from us\nKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!\nToo much to one! but double how endured,\nTo one, and to his image now proclaimed?\nBut what if better counsels might erect\nOur minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?\nWill ye submit your necks, and choose to bend\nThe supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust\nTo know ye right, or if ye know yourselves\nNatives and sons of Heaven possessed before\nBy none; and if not equal all, yet free,\nEqually free; for orders and degrees\nJar not with liberty, but well consist.\nWho can in reason then, or right, assume\nMonarchy over such as live by right\nHis equals, if in power and splendour less,\nIn freedom equal? or can introduce\nLaw and edict on us, who without law\nErr not? much less for this to be our Lord,\nAnd look for adoration, to the abuse\nOf those imperial titles, which assert\nOur being ordained to govern, not to serve.\nThus far his bold discourse without controul\nHad audience; when among the Seraphim\nAbdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored\nThe Deity, and divine commands obeyed,\nStood up, and in a flame of zeal severe\nThe current of his fury thus opposed.\nO argument blasphemous, false, and proud!\nWords which no ear ever to hear in Heaven\nExpected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate,\nIn place thyself so high above thy peers.\nCanst thou with impious obloquy condemn\nThe just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,\nThat to his only Son, by right endued\nWith regal scepter, every soul in Heaven\nShall bend the knee, and in that honour due\nConfess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,\nFlatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,\nAnd equal over equals to let reign,\nOne over all with unsucceeded power.\nShalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute\nWith him the points of liberty, who made\nThee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven\nSuch as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?\nYet, by experience taught, we know how good,\nAnd of our good and of our dignity\nHow provident he is; how far from thought\nTo make us less, bent rather to exalt\nOur happy state, under one head more near\nUnited.  But to grant it thee unjust,\nThat equal over equals monarch reign:\nThyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,\nOr all angelick nature joined in one,\nEqual to him begotten Son? by whom,\nAs by his Word, the Mighty Father made\nAll things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven\nBy him created in their bright degrees,\nCrowned them with glory, and to their glory named\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,\nEssential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,\nBut more illustrious made; since he the head\nOne of our number thus reduced becomes;\nHis laws our laws; all honour to him done\nReturns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,\nAnd tempt not these; but hasten to appease\nThe incensed Father, and the incensed Son,\nWhile pardon may be found in time besought.\nSo spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal\nNone seconded, as out of season judged,\nOr singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced\nThe Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.\nThat we were formed then sayest thou? and the work\nOf secondary hands, by task transferred\nFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!\nDoctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw\nWhen this creation was? rememberest thou\nThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?\nWe know no time when we were not as now;\nKnow none before us, self-begot, self-raised\nBy our own quickening power, when fatal course\nHad circled his full orb, the birth mature\nOf this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.\nOur puissance is our own; our own right hand\nShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try\nWho is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold\nWhether by supplication we intend\nAddress, and to begirt the almighty throne\nBeseeching or besieging.  This report,\nThese tidings carry to the anointed King;\nAnd fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.\nHe said; and, as the sound of waters deep,\nHoarse murmur echoed to his words applause\nThrough the infinite host; nor less for that\nThe flaming Seraph fearless, though alone\nEncompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.\nO alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,\nForsaken of all good!  I see thy fall\nDetermined, and thy hapless crew involved\nIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spread\nBoth of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth\nNo more be troubled how to quit the yoke\nOf God's Messiah; those indulgent laws\nWill not be now vouchsafed; other decrees\nAgainst thee are gone forth without recall;\nThat golden scepter, which thou didst reject,\nIs now an iron rod to bruise and break\nThy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;\nYet not for thy advice or threats I fly\nThese wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath\nImpendent, raging into sudden flame,\nDistinguish not:  For soon expect to feel\nHis thunder on thy head, devouring fire.\nThen who created thee lamenting learn,\nWhen who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.\nSo spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found\nAmong the faithless, faithful only he;\nAmong innumerable false, unmoved,\nUnshaken, unseduced, unterrified,\nHis loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;\nNor number, nor example, with him wrought\nTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,\nThough single.  From amidst them forth he passed,\nLong way through hostile scorn, which he sustained\nSuperiour, nor of violence feared aught;\nAnd, with retorted scorn, his back he turned\nOn those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.",

In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat butter, oil, and both sugars until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla until it is combined. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Mix to combine. Gently stir in the peeled, shredded apples. Generously grease and flour a standard size bundt cake pan. Transfer the batter to the bundt pan and use a spatula to gently even out the top. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes before flipping the cake to remove the cake from the pan. Completely cool the cake on a wire rack. You can freeze the cake before icing by wrapping the cooled cake tightly in plastic wrap. For the maple glaze: Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl. This will prevent any lumps in your icing. Add the milk and maple extract. Mix well to combine. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.",

In a microwave-safe bowl, combine butter, milk and water. Heat for 2 minutes. Test with your finger; if the mixture is too hot to the touch, it will be too hot for your yeast. Add liquid ingredients to the dry mixture. Mix. Now add the eggs and mix well. Add 6 cups of flour. This will give you a very sticky dough. Add 2 1/2 cups of flour and knead in. Knead for 5 minutes. Your dough will be still be a little sticky. Add the oil to a bowl and roll your dough in it. Let rise for 2 hours, punch down and rise for another hour. For the filling: Divide your dough in half. Take one half and split it into 3 sections. You will need to roll this out in a long oval. Spread a little melted butter across the dough. You do not want too much or it will make your dough very soggy. Mix cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg together. Now sprinkle your mixture of sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg over the dough. (Don't use too much. This mixture will make two whole braids or 6 rolled out sections.) Once you have done this, roll up the dough. Now do this two more times. Once you have 3 pieces done, braid them together. Do the other half to the dough the same way. Tuck the ends under and let rise for 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for 28 to 30 minutes. This recipe makes two braids! For the glaze: Mix the melted butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla together. Take a spoon and drizzle over a cooled braid. Top with pecans and 3 cherries. Serve with coffee, milk or orange juice on Christmas morning. This is AMAZING!",
    "1 1/2 Tbl. grated ginger\n1 lemon\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 teaspoon yeast\ncool water\nclean 2-liter bottle or growler jug\n1. Juice the lemon and set it aside.  2. Pour the sugar into the bottle.  4. Pour the yeast into the bottle. Shake the bottle so that the yeast and sugar are mixed well.  5. Pour the ginger and the lemon juice into the bottle.  6. Fill the bottle about one-quarter full of cold water and shake well again, so that everything's mixed well and the sugar and yeast are dissolved.  7. Fill up the bottle with water until nearly but not quite full, leaving an inch or two of space from the lid.  8. Leave out the bottle in a warm spot for 2-3 days, or until it's carbonated to the degree you want. Then chill the ginger ale in the fridge and enjoy. (You'll probably want to filter the ginger ale as you pour it into the glass. Otherwise you'll get little bits of grated ginger stuck on your lips.)  Warning: If you leave the bottle too long in the warmth, you risk the bottle exploding.  Feel free to fiddle around with the amounts of ginger, lemon or sugar, as you like. Personally, I've found that 1 cup of sugar seems the perfect amount, for me, at least. Even a scant bit less makes the soda bland; a little bit more gets syrupy sweet.",
    "3 cups all-purpose flour\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n1 3/4 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n1 large egg\n6 tablespoons ice water\n1. Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and mix together with your fingertips or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. 2. Mix the egg with the water in a small bowl. Toss the mixture gently with the butter mixture until the dough comes together; do not overwork it. Divide the dough in half. Flatten each half with the palm of your hand to form a thick disk. Wrap both disks in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 3. Remove 1 disk of dough from the refrigerator. Unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of wax paper to form a circle about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky. 4. Use a spatula to help lift the dough and fold it loosely in half, then in quarters. Gently transfer the dough to the pie plate, placing the corner of the dough in the center of the plate. Open up the dough and press it lightly into the plate to fit. (If the dough should tear, just press it gently together.) Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. 5. Repeat the rolling process with the second disk of dough to make the top crust. The circle of the top crust should be 10 inches in diameter.",
    "1 chicken carcass or leftover bones from several legs, wings etc.\n1 stalk celery\n1 onion\n1 carrot\n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed (optional)\n3-4 cloves garlic, crushed (optional)\n1 bunch fresh thyme or 2-3 tsp dry\nPut everything in a big pot. Pour in enough water to cover the bones and veggies. Bring to a boil then turn to low heat. Skim off any foamy stuff that comes to the top of the broth. Simmer for about 3 hours (split up the time throughout the day if necessary - if you can watch the stove so long). Check periodically to stir up a little and add more water if it has evaporated too much (keep it at the level you started). After cooking, remove all the big pieces of chicken bones and vegetables with tongs or a spoon. There's no more flavor left in the vegetables or meat, so you can discard. The broth should look golden and delicious :) Let cool then strain out the broth to get rid of any small pieces of veggies, etc. and put in a big tupperware, or jar. If freezing, store in a freezer safe container or zip-lock bags after cooling. One easy way to use the fresh broth right away is to make a vegetable soup! Cut up your favorite veggies into small pieces (I used onion, celery, carrots, potatoes and cauliflower). Saute the veggies in a little olive oil, then pour in some broth to cover. Cook until vegetables are tender. This is also great to add noodles (and leftover chicken) too for chicken noodle soup!",

Add the salt and sugar and cook until dissolved. Add the fennel seeds, garlic, thyme and fennel fronds and remove from the heat. Let cool completely (or reduce the amount of water in the brine by 2 cups and add 4 cups ice cubes to cool down immediately). Transfer the brine to a plastic container, add the pork, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. For the smoked pork: Remove the pork from the brine, rinse well with cold water and pat dry. Put on a rack set over a baking sheet and refrigerate (to allow a crust, or skin, to form on the outside) for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours. Remove the grill grate and ceramic plate from the cooker. Add the hot hardwood charcoal and scatter the soaked wood chips over the top. Put on the ceramic plate and the grill rack, close the cover, bring the temperature to between 300 and 325 degrees F and allow to smoke for 10 minutes. Brush the entire loin with oil and sprinkle with pepper. Place on the rack, close the cover and smoke at 140 degrees F until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers, 1 to 1 hour 30 minutes. While the pork smokes, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey. Start brushing it on the pork about 30 minutes before it is done. When done, remove, loosely tent and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. For the fennel gremolata: Cut the fennel into small dice and coarsely chop the fronds; put in a bowl. Add the zest and juice and drizzle with a little olive oil; mix to combine. Let sit at room temperature.

Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy and begins to smell of yeast. Add the flour and butter to the yeast mixture. Attach the dough hook to the stand mixer and, on medium-low speed, combine the mixture until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and appears shiny, roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Spray a large bowl with non-stick spray (or lightly grease with vegetable oil) and place dough in greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Place bowl in a warm area and let dough rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Place an oven rack in the top third of your oven, and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Spray parchment paper with non-stick spray. Set aside. In a large pot, bring the 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil. Place the dough on a greased surface, and divide into 16 equal pieces (If you weigh dough, like I do, they will be about 2.20 oz. each). Roll each piece into a long rope, roughly 12 inches long. Carefully wrap half of each piece around a third of a hot dog. Pinch the ends together to seal the dough. If you run out of hot dogs before dough, make regular pretzels. Cut a little more dough off (3 oz.), and shape as desired. Place each shaped pretzel on the parchment lined baking sheet. Boil the shaped pretzels and pretzel dogs, one at a time, in the baking soda water for 30 seconds each. Using a slotted spatula or spider strainer, remove each pretzel dog from the water and place it on a drying rack to allow any extra baking soda mixture to drip off. Place the boiled pretzel dogs back on the parchment lined baking sheets. Brush with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with pretzel or kosher salt. Bake until golden brown, roughly 10 1/2 minutes (14 to 15 minutes for large pretzels). Transfer pretzel dogs to a cooling rack for a few minutes before serving. Serve with a variety of mustards or cheese sauce.",

    "2 poblano/pasilla peppers\n1 onion, chopped\n3 fresh corn, kernels cut off\n1/2 cup chicken/veggie broth or water\nsplash cream/whole milk\n1/4 pound queso fresco, cubed\nChar the peppers. Poblano pepper skins have a slightly bitter taste so you need to get it off. In order to do this you have 2 options. If you have a gas stove that produces a flame, char the peppers over the flame until the skin is black and blistered over the whole pepper. I have an electric stove so what I do is set the oven to broil and move one of the racks up to the very top. Broil the peppers, rotating as soon as the skin by the broiler is black, until it's charred on all sides. Put the charred peppers in a plastic bag or in a bowl covered in plastic as soon as they're done being charred to steam it so the skin peels off easily. Peel the peppers. Some peppers are a little spicy so wearing gloves could be useful. Peel all the skin off the peppers. Then remove the stem, seeds and veins. Slice into strips. Heat some olive or vegetable oil over medium heat in a pan big enough to hold all the corn and peppers. Saute the onion until clear and fragrant. Add the corn kernels, peppers and broth. Simmer covered for about 15 minutes. Add the splash of cream and remove from heat. Stir in cheese and enjoy.",

Add the sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, orange zest and cloves and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for about an hour. In the meantime, make the chocolate sauce. Combine the chocolate and cream in a small saucepan and set over low heat. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is just melted, and then remove from the heat and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the vanilla, cinnamon and cayenne pepper. If necessary, whisk in a little bit of water to loosen the sauce. Set aside in a warm place. Pour about an inch of oil into a wide, shallow saucepan and set over medium-high heat. When a small piece of batter sizzles after you drop it into the oil, you are ready to fry. Drop rounded teaspoons of the batter into the oil in small batches and fry for about 2 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown. Drain the fritters on paper towels, dust with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately with the chocolate sauce (if it has thickened too much, you may need to reheat the sauce gently, whisking constantly, and add a bit more water).",
    "2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter\n1 1/4 cups superfine sugar\n4 cups all-purpose flour\nBlanched almonds or pistachio nuts to decorate\nCream the butter and beat it until it becomes white. Add the sugar, beating constantly for about 5 minutes, until it is a smooth cream. Add flour gradually, working it in by hand. Although no liquid is added, this makes a very soft dough. If the dough is too soft, add a little more flour. Take walnut-sized lumps, roll them into balls, and flatten them slightly. Place them on a baking sheet a little apart from each other, as they spread slightly. Stick a blanched almond or pistachio on top of each one. Bake in a 325F oven for 2030 minutes. Do not let the ghorayebah overcook. They must remain very white: they taste quite different if they are even slightly brown. Let them cool before you try to move them. An exquisite variation is to replace 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup ground hazelnuts. You can flavor the dough with a grating of nutmeg, or 12 teaspoons of cinnamon or ground cardamom. Another traditional shape for ghorayebah is little bracelets. Roll the dough into 4-inch-long sausage shapes about 1/2 inch thick, and bring the ends together to make bracelets. Decorate with split almonds or pistachios.",

But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

Dust mites are something I’ve always suspected but was not officially diagnosed with it until I took the test. Growing up, I’ve always had cold urticaria but that seem to have disappeared only to be replaced with sun sensitivity. And there’s so little known about PMLE like I just wanna know what’s going on with my body. I feel so helpless. I just wanna be out and sunbathe and not to be so itchy the next day.",
    "Me and my wife moved to Alabama to take care of my grandparents, my grandfather has dementia and my grandma, Well she just has a bad habit of not doing stuff and just praying everything will work out. They moved to Alabama to our current house to live with my great uncle. He passed away without an updated will while verbally he said the house was going to my grandparents his will was made in the 1990s. We got the house probated and my grandpa ended up being the owner of the estate. My grandma told me that they had it put in their name and that they were going to make a will. After my grandpa passed away I found out that they neither put the house in their name nor did they make a will. Dose my grandma inherit the estate of my great uncle? Or are we going to have to probate the house again?",
    "Kind of following up on my earlier post. I've managed to get Mech Assault's .xiso extracted and onto my console's hdd via ftp networking but it won't boot. Am I missing something? When I try to rip it with dvd2xbox, it says it failed to get like 5 out of 90 files. I've tried ripping it twice with the same results. I don't want to keep trying to rip it or play it off the disc and contribute to burning out my disc drive. Not sure why the install isn't working. Anything obvious I'm missing? I was also wondering if anyone has actually played Mech Assault on a modded og xbox. Maybe there's just a compatibility issue with Evo x and the game. The game boots up and plays just fine if I do try to play it off the disc and it doesn't look damaged so I don't think it's a problem with the disc",
    "Missing 411 cases fascinate me in part because they really come closest to feeling like the closest real-life analogue to a Cthulhu-esque horror. In the Cthulhu books, these types of beings were portrayed as completely alien and unfathomable, like there is no way to understand their intentions or desires, they are just on another level entirely. They are also irresistibly powerful, mere humans have no hope of overpowering them or defeating them. In Missing 411 cases, we have no idea why this is done to people and what they get out of it, but there is a clear intelligence to which victims are taken, when they are taken, and how they are taken. Also, the entity responsible seems to have no constraints, taking people even from crowded areas and always being able to avoid being witnessed by other people or even security cameras. The implications of this phenomena are utterly terrifying and fascinating.",

    "Hi everyone, I’ve been selling for just over a year, launched 3 relatively successful products, and recently launched a fourth in the health and beauty category which has been a complete disappointment. I felt I had done my research, had invested in great photos and spent time making a keyword rich listing, but found the lower price point to be far lower than I expected to get even one or two sales. Long term I am struggling to see how I can make profit margins when I include PPC/VAT. Seems like there is now an ongoing price war in the niche and I can’t see anyone making money. I can always try to drive external traffic sources, improve the listing and drive more reviews, but when do you decide it’s not worth the investment with this ASIN and move on? A lot of gurus online talk about their biggest “failures”, but I had always felt there was a solution to most challenges that can be overcome by improvements to the listing or advertising approach before giving up. At what point do people pull out of a product line and decide this is a “failure” and not worth further investment?",
    "I’ve been talking to this girl for a while now and even though she tells me that she feels comfortable with me, it doesn’t feel like she is. She doesn’t send many pictures of herself even though I do and I also tell her she’s very pretty when she sends a picture or when she turns her camera on when we call. But she just doesn’t seem very comfortable with showing her face a lot. Also sometimes I feel like maybe I’m too clingy and I just want to be talking to her all the time and maybe that makes her uncomfortable. I’m also very open about how I feel about us and how I hope that in the future we can be together and even though she has told me that she wants to be with me too, sometimes it doesn’t feel like it. I don’t know maybe I’m just overthinking the whole thing and she does want to be with me but she’s just not as open about her feelings as I am.",
    "I'm slowly starting back up in the dating pool after a long term relationship and I think that probably the worst part about it is I relocated due to my job, and the city I'm in is considered one of the worst in the US for trying to find a relationship. So many reports of how the hookup culture hears vastly outweighs the dating culture. Definitely made me a bit worried, but maybe I'll get lucky. Also, aside from how bad dating apps have gotten from all of the extra features that help less and the addition of triple the pay walls for some apps, is it just me or has the landscape gotten more kinky? I mean, I look around and there are so many who mention that they have a kink. It definitely makes me a proven vanilla that much harder to find someone out there, and I'm already looking in a smaller pool of potential dates since I would love someone on the more nerdy/geeky side",
    "I think the title is self explanatory. It’s true. When I have a crush I hate myself for having a crush on them. Because I know that I can’t do anything about it. And although I would like to confess I’m actually scared of them saying yes. Weird right? I mean I’m supposed to happy if my crush says yes to goin g out with me but for me it’s the opposite. Because I know that when we’re together all I’m going to think about is when we break up. Where I’m going to break up with them. What the reason should be for me breaking up with them. And how I should break up with them. And that feeling makes me feel so guilty because this precious person is giving me their all and here I am being a half-assed person. But I can’t help myself from having a crush, it just happens. I feel sorry for whoever I come to like and come to date. I feel like I’m going to be lonely until the end of time.",
    "So I spent a day with my boy bestfriend and we went out and got food and spoke and we just had fun. Later when we were at his house he was being really comfortable and he cuddled me and was being different. I felt bad for liking it and wanting to take it further. It felt wrong to be like that with him so I broke up with my boyfriend. But that wasn't the only reason I broke up with him, I realized I didn't want to kiss him or anything anymore and I feel like I subconsciously moved him back to \"friend\" in my mind. And I'm 17 and realized I didn't really want such a serious relationship right now, or a relationship at all rn. So after that my boy bestfriend made a move and now he wants a relationship but I don't, but I liked it when he kissed me. So I don't know what to do",
    "I believe that the tech market will be down on Monday. The report was quite positive, smashing expectations for new jobs. There is other stuff. But I see value stocks back in play for Monday. Rotation out of tech for a day or two, and then back into tech for April. The fact that the report was positive sounds positive overall, but more jobs means more workers, and more people being out and about and spending on basic necessities that they needed. I can’t imagine this translating to more spending on tech stocks. I think there’s still value in some tech stocks, which is why I say April will be green overall, but I’m talking Monday open after Easter. Historically seems to be more favored to a down day also. Thoughts?",
    "My mom notably would always say she was gonna “drive away from the house” and leave, and stuff similar to that. My parents would always fight and actually get in legitimate fights with each other and I remember once when I was younger, they made me pick between which parent I wanted to stay with because I thought they were moving away from each other. I used to look back on this stuff and not think it was horrible, I don’t even know if I think it’s horrible now because I’m used to it. I remember once my dad would chase me with his belt around a table, I don’t know why he did this but he did, I must’ve done something to deserve it.. I remember being beaten/hit by both of them for reasons i don’t even know. i think being afraid of saying something wrong and having my stuff taken away from me as a consequence transferred over to me being this antisocial person that has trouble talking and being vulnerable with people.. anyway enough rambling, does that stuff cause abandonment issues/other things?",
    "For those freaking out about the price differences, think of it in comparison to the credit bureaus. Your credit scores are not the same across the board. Each bureau has a different way of calculating your score, and some have different information. But eventually, it all all even up and be closer to one another. If you are already getting restless and impatient, maybe you shouldn’t be investing in crypto or stocks for that matter. Everyone needs to take a chill, sit back and enjoy the ride. Buy the dips if you want to get more, but hold on to your coins and let the system do the work for you. If you are super worried about losing money, just pull out your initial investment once you make money, and let your profit do the work. But you’re gonna regret it when it takes off and you sold potential millions.",
    "Brief as backstory. My mother is emotionally damaged, severely, not her fault, but resulted in an upbringing where by the age of 9 I was taken to a lot of psychologists to find out “ what was wrong with me”. I left home when I was 14, stayed an aunt until I was 17, moved out and made my own life. Fast forward 13 years, I have a degree, job, house, kids everything I wanted, 2 weeks ago my mum was supposed to be attending a family event but decided not to go, but wanted to come and visit my kids and stay at our house. It’s been 1.5 years since we saw her last so I said yes. She came, was her typical self, this time I felt sorry for her as supposed to getting angry at her for her behaviours - she’ll tell my daughter they’ll go do something then say no she’s too tired. Anyway, since she’s left, I cannot shake the feeling of how I used to feel when I was 14. Things were never good enough, I wasn’t going to go far in life, my achievements aren’t really achievements. Then she texts and asks about only ONE of her grandchildren, typical her behaviour. I’ve talked to my husband about it, I’ve trained hard at the gym gone for extra runs. I’m short with my own kids which isn’t usual for me, I cannot fathom why she is doing the exact same thing she did to me and my brothers now she’s trying to divide my kids, she knew exactly what she was doing, she’s horrible - asked multiple times when my second child’s birthday was. I can’t seem to calm down from this, like I say, I’ve reverted right back to 14 and all those feels associated with that and it sucks.",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "This is like day 5 and i woke up this morning with like no withdrawal symptoms and no cravings. I basically just took supplements, drank a lot of water and coffee, and smoked weed at night. Honestly i think the supplements are what helped the most I strongly encourage who ever is quitting to take ashwagandha, Htp-5, and Rhodiola Rosea Extract two of each twice a day. Its been giving me the biggest boosts of serotonin and as i did feel the withdrawal symptoms this dramatically reduced them. I’m telling you if you are struggling take these and you will feel soo much better. And also smoke weed or take CBD if you like, it kinda takes the edge off. But i like these supplements so much I’ll probably take them for a long time",
    "I use syncthing on my Android phone and my PC to sync photos and ebooks etc. I thought it might be a good idea to tell my client to then only sync when I'm on my home network to save a bit of battery when I'm out and about and need it more. I don't really need it to sync to my PC while I'm out anyway, I can wait for it to do so automatically when i get home. I enabled location permissions and got it working, but was bummed to find that out requires location to be on to figure out what network I'm connected to. I never turn my location on at home because I don't need to use GPS to find my way around my house, 😆. Seems a really weird and silly way for this to work. Why can't it tell what SSID I'm on and figure without turning on my GPS. Are there any good workarounds besides leaving sync on all the time or turning location on when I'm at home?",
    "I have been taking klonopijn daily for around 5 years now. Recently since the pandemic started and my life started to fall apart before my eyes, I was upped in my dosage. Then I was upped again, and again, and again. Now I am at the point of taking 6mg-8mg/day. It has gotten completely out of control and made my situation from covid even worse and less manageable. and I almost have no tolerance. I want to start a taper, not an aggressive one, that will help bring me back down to at least 1mg/day. Could this be done in a couple of months? If so does anyone have good taper recommendations. Furthermore, considering the stress will feel at times almost unbearable, does anyone know of any good anti stress replacements or anything that can be taken during this process?",
    "Argus new changes in the advanced server is really bad. This is due to his base Physical Atk and growth being nerfed significantly. Furthermore we got a stun duration nerf for a range buff, but a range buff wasn’t needed yet that stun duration is crucial and the reason why i would even call it argus best skill.  all of this huge nerfs just for passive being 320% yet this depends on his physical atk so the nerfs actually nerfs this buff as well. So in conclusion. This changes overall nerfs argus. Current live argus is great tbh. a small buff instead to like 280% is suffice or just the quality of life like the animation stop i would say instead of basically nerfing him more in terms of dmg cause -75 is A LOT",

    "Every so often I have troubles getting an erection. I’m a 24yo male and shouldn’t have this issue. With my ex it was like a gust of wind could get it up. Now not so much. And as this happens every so often it affects my perspective of my feelings for her. It makes me question if I love her or not or if it’s my body telling me I am not attracted when I don’t actually feel that way. It’s depressing and I am on lexapro and know that can be a factor but am I crazy for thinking this . Is it just a snowball effect because of that? Is this a normal occurrence for people sometimes.

I've known what it's like to be in the darkest place in the world, and I really don't want to go back. Today, I had a lot of fun going out with a friend to watch Godzilla vs Kong and walk around town for a bit. At the end of the day, I came back home and just realized \"Man, everything is so damn awful when we aren't hanging out\". That led to a lot more thinking about how much I'm fucking up my life by failing tons of my classes, how much time I spend sitting here being a worthless person, and how I'm such a burden on everyone. Literally nothing seems fun unless I'm around them, and I think it's sad that, even though I have blood relatives, the only person I consider to be family is him. I guess I don't want to be loved, I want to feel loved. I really hope this is just an episode and not something worse. Sorry for the rant, but hey, I didn't make you read this.",

Couldn’t possibly imagine being prepared for a ton of people trying to play and having your server situation figured out beforehand so you don’t look as incompetent as every other crap gaming company in existence today.

    "Hey y’all, struggling Christian here with a question. When I pray alone I feel like I’m talking to myself. It feels weird because prayer is kind of like a letter to god so it shouldn’t feel like a conversation. But then I started think that all of the good feelings I get come from within me like happiness, joy, or excitement. Those are all internal feeing that can show through my expressions and words but at their core they are from my brain. And I used to think I needed to thank God for those feelings because he was the one that put them there. But now I feel like those good feelings I get are just a reaction based on what’s happening around me and to me. So my questions is: is it possible gods love comes from ourselves rather then from him? And if so why would I need God anymore?",

I also live with my fiancé and so when they interviewed me she asked all about him as well since we live in the same household. I figured we wouldn't receive any benefits because he made okay money then and was not laid off. At the time of the interview I did verbally tell my caseworker that he was not working at that moment only due to complications with covid shut down everything. She still had me send over his last 2 check stubs and then we ended up getting approved. I was shocked but excited. Cut to now.

One thing I’ve learned about is how much I dissociate and how this has been a defense mechanism since was a kid.  She has been gently letting me know that I may have some degree of DID or dissociative identity disorder.  This was pretty scary at first but I’m thinking that she may be on to something.  I don’t have multiple identities on the outside that anyone would notice, but it’s clear that my childhood trauma caused me to have splintered off parts of self that have never been integrated.  Those parts of self are in regular conflict with each other and the result is anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.

I think short sides and longer hair on top is so attractive and I want to look like that but I’m always worried I couldn’t pull it off.

Something along the lines of \"this type of trap has active and dynamic effects, and different aspects of it may have countermeasures\", kind of thing?  Or should I leave it to them to figure out.  I don't want to hand hold too much, but it also kind of sucks to be taking part in a 'mini-game' and not even know its happening.

I have also in recent years educated myself on basic programming so I also have an interest in how the stock market is run by computer. The program/s that run it is no doubt a monster. So, that leads me to a question. What is the likely hood that a stock can be 'throttled' so it doesn't rise as it should? The calculations tweaked so it is less responsive to growth. Assuming the rise of a stock is a linear rise, what if they set it so that it is a non-linear rise, finally topping out at a pre-specified amount? Who runs the software and servers that handle all of this? Is there a company that does it? The government? I've never heard anything on this subject, ever.",

My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

And on the internet I thought I had a chance to feel more comfortable, and act freely to be myself.

I try to be outgoing and social, but when people tell me Im being annoying it makes me feel stupid. And sometimes I tell myself, “be yourself”.

We broke up about 6 years ago. And while she moved on after couple of months Ive not been able to do the same thing even after 6 years. Not a day goes by when I don’t think about her. We haven’t talked since several years and i don’t want to disturb her life now. Every-time I initiate dating someone all i see is her face what would be her reaction on that joke or how would she react. She has a boyfriend now. While I’m still miserable. Trust me Ive tried moving on. Tried online dating. Tried everything. But she just cant go away from my mind. Her memories have become a painful comfort. Why do you think this is happening and what should I do to get over her? Ive tried therapy Ive tried burning mementos. But she is tattooed inside my mind.",
    "Covid is a contagious and deadly virus, no matter what people have read on their shady \"news\" sites or watched in YouTube videos. Actual experts and their advice exist. However, as a therapist, I am expected to validate thoughts and resulting ignorant actions as though it could be truth. I'm tired of it. Adults have a responsibility to educate themselves and recognize propaganda. In this case, the ignorance is killing people. Yet, I have to look them in the eye and pretend to understand their views so that I don't cause THEM more psychological harm as they breathe freely in my space without masks during a deadly pandemic. I don't love shaming people but if anyone should be, it is them. People I know have suffered. Some have died. But I can't, because somehow it is just expected that I'll put my health at risk daily, and not doing so could cost me my job, license, etc. I'm just over it, and over these ignorant folks.",
    "Hi. I want help if anyone can spare a few words of encouragement. I wrote religious on the topic of this because I am kind of a religious. I grew up catholic and I don’t follow the church a lot but I do have faith. I’ve posted her before about how my dad treats me. I’m the oldest daughter and I feel like my mom and I are used as the scapegoat to why everything is horrible for my dad. Anyway, I feel alone a lot. I pray and I feel like no one is listening. Does anyone have some scripture or words of encouragement from the Bible? I sometimes feel like I am the one in the wrong because my dad uses God and my faith against me. Anything would be great. I am going to get a keepsake with the Virgin Mary on it to keep me safe and to remind myself she is there with me. Anyway, thank you to this group. It makes me feel less alone.",
    "I’m a 23 y/o female, 5’2”, and currently weigh 141lbs. I work out 3-4 times a week and am on my feet constantly at work. I’d say I eat an overall healthy diet, cook majority of the time at home, and would describe  myself as moderately active. My concern is over the past year I have gained 10lbs and not changed any of these practices. I’ve been told the weight could be muscles or due to recently returning to school and undergoing stress but I find myself ashamed and unmotivated to continue working out and pushing myself harder. I love weights and cardio but have been finding it hard to motivate myself when I see the number on the scale going up. Am I just psyching myself out or do I need to revisit my overall health routine?",
    "My grandma passed away when I was 8 years old, over 25 years ago. She and my mom were very close; they talked almost every day and were like best friends. After she passed away it was like a light went out in my mom. Every occasion, happy or sad, has had a dark cloud over it because my grandma wasn't there. I miss my grandma too, but it makes me so sad to feel like I will never see my mom truly happy again. She is now the same age that my grandma was when she died, so all the grief is coming out even more. I am the main person she comes to for support and I don't know how to handle it. She calls me crying and says things like, \"I'm just so sad. My life would be so much better if she was still alive.\" I feel like I need to be the \"parent\" and support my mom because she is always so sad all the time.  I was wondering if anyone else was in a similar situation or had any words of advice or wisdom. Thank you.",
    "I had a dream when I was sitting on my couch at night with a girl I didn’t recognize. Although I didn’t recognize her she felt so familiar and it felt like I knew every thing about her. Her brother walked in through the front door and said something that frustrated her. I put my arm around her and then realized that I don’t know her, but she looked at me and put my hand back around her. We fell asleep like that and when I woke up she was gone. I went into my room and there were all these clues left around pointing to seemingly nothing. The only one I can remember is that there was an extra sticker near a power outlet that was a brand which I didn’t use. I recognized this bc I had always used a rival brand. All I can say is that the rest of the dream was me trying to find her and I never did. This last part was very vague.",

    "As a young person and recent defector of the Liberal/Democrat ideology, I have been thinking about the state of our culture and time here in America. Every day I feel myself compelled to stand up and speak in an act of revolution against the status quo. I feel as if God is telling me to follow my heart and speak the truth as an artist against the untruth. But fear is prevalent. Most art, film, music, writing are dominated by ideologically liberal leaning people. Websites where artists gather to advertise their work like YouTube and Facebook are censoring and banning voices that have Conservative values and ideas. How far can I get as an artist down this path? I feel like a bird being forced to crawl on the ground feeling so desperate and hopeless wanting to use the gift and passion my God has given me. In this time when the voice of a conservative is a revolutionary act, are there enough minds out there that would support or be interested in conservative art? I want myself to be economically stable enough to support myself, my future wife, and children. Or should I find another passion?",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

But it doesn’t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with “hitler was a nazi”. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with “that’s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.” What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every “nazi” so that it is only pure people with his beliefs.

    "So, I’m currently trying to teach myself astrology. I find that looking at each thing in my chart helps with understanding parts of it. Like for example, my Mars in Libra is what helps me approach things more calmly and my Mercury in Capricorn helps me to formulate my sentences before saying them. But what I have trouble with is putting everything together. I’ve been reading up on aspects and patterns as well, but I just get so confused. It’s like I have the puzzle pieces but I don’t know how to put them together. So I was wondering how everyone here got the hang of reading charts as a whole instead of just their parts?

Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",
    "With such an epic story, you would think someone like Stone would produce an epic film. From the random accents of the characters (specifically, I have no idea what Jolie was trying to do), to some pretty atrocious acting from Farrell-he's capable of much better, but this was at the height of his grandiosity and ego. There are so many moments where it feels like the film is onto something, only to have it stop and spin off into another, pointless direction. Bottom line: a $155 mil film about Alexander the Great should have been iconic, but Alexander falls flat on its face from the weight of the egos involved.",
    "The film is dark humoured, satiric and mocking mirror of society reflecting on human's obsession to fit in certain rules of society, despite how ridiculous they are. We step on our primary feelings and ignore our instincts just to play by the rules, to belong. And even it was the clear theme of being obsessed with being in a couple, I see it as a bigger reflection of society. After the main character runs into the woods, where he finds rebels of coupling, it's clear that they are as extreme as the hotel people. It looks like it's shown that people have to belong to survive, but options are limited and you have to obey, pretend or risk to be destroyed. Various examples of dysfunctional relationships are shown in the film, which looks so familiar – pretending to have something in common, pretending that you understand that you are the same. Desperation, rejection, cruelty in the relationships – we have seen and know it all, but director found the way to remind it with a lighter tone, with the possibility to laugh at ourselves and society. All the characters acted and talked in the same hyper-polite manner – that's what we do, so often we dance around difficult and extreme situations with our repressed feelings. And despite how similar everyone talked, with the same tone and politeness, we can see through that and find individuality of the characters, and it shows that we are more than just rules, etiquette  The obsession to have something in common with you partner reached the peek at the end. It looked like even David and blind women are still in love, but a realisation that in society norms they don't have anything real in common drives to an extreme decision. It shows that we sacrifice so much if we love someone different, and all just to be more acceptable in the society, but at the end society doesn't care, so do we just have to be braver? This film makes more think than feel. The audience who is used to relate to the characters might find it difficult, as even the main character is not very lovable, he is a week and very human in other words. It's not a 'feel good' film but not miserablism, it's smart and innovative reminder",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.<br/><br/>The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.<br/><br/>I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.<br/><br/>If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it. It's too late now - I can't get it out of my head. I don't think I've ever been affected this much by a movie.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.<br/><br/>It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.<br/><br/>It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.<br/><br/>Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended.",
    "Ice age 3 was really funny and it stays true to the series. Same old characters, a whole new adventure that everyone at any age can enjoy.<br/><br/>I saw the critics and I thought to my self that it would be good, but I didn't expect much, but I really did enjoy it more than I thought. It may not be the best compared to the other Ice Age films, but it still a great thrill ride that the audience can enjoy.<br/><br/>And if you find a theater near you that has it in digital 3D, go and watch it in 3D, because the action and adventure will excite you even more than it actually does.<br/><br/>Normally people think since it's a third part, then the movie won't be that great, but hear me when I say that keep that thought out of your mind and parents, take your kids with you, they are sure to leave with a smile and a long lasting excitement for more.<br/><br/>100% enjoyable, its a 10!",
    "I love this movie! It was so adorable, so charming & the writing was absolutely terrific! I love the animation & the characters (including the minions) were all fantastic! A MUST WATCH!",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. <br/><br/>The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! <br/><br/>For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go see this.",
    "I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.<br/><br/>Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. <br/><br/>The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room, my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. <br/><br/>The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!<br/><br/>Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. <br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. <br/><br/>Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. <br/><br/>John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. <br/><br/>I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as \"Sergeant Major Dickerson\",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",
    "We all remember being a teenager.  A crazy, intense time when your high were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant.<br/><br/>John Hughes movie brilliantly captures that environment, that era in our lives, and all the social rifts that we all helped to create for ourselves. I have heard it said that \"The Breakfast Club\" is melodramatic, overacted, and simplistic.  If you subscribe to that flippant perspective you might as well join Vernon in his office because you are doing the same thing that he did.  Seeing the movie as you want to see it, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.<br/><br/>If you really want to understand this film, think back to your own high school days.  Think about your last year there.  Dig out your old diary or book of angstful poems and reaquaint yourself with who you were then, when you felt things more deeply.  \"The Breakfast Club\" does not exist not for highschool kids, as some suggest.  Why would they need it?  They live there. It exists for all of us who have already been through there, who feel that they are above it now.  It exists so that we can remember what it was like and better understand ourselves, and the next generation.  Because you can't dismiss something you understand.",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot?

    "I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.",
    "As most are undoubtedly aware this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS (1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.<br/><br/>But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.<br/><br/>Shooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.<br/><br/>Later, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together. <br/><br/>But SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.",
    "I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.<br/><br/>As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!<br/><br/>Overall - 8/10",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",
    "This film was exceptional and one of the best I've seen this year. Watiti has great comedic vision and the cast is phenomenal. Jojo Rabbit was wierd , funny , heartwarming and heartbreaking and I think its definitely worth the watch.",
    "I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no \"Finding Nemo\" or \"Toy Story.\" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!<br/><br/>In my opinion, Cars 1 was a little slow. It dragged a little too long in certain parts. Cars 2 suffers from no such thing.<br/><br/>To sum it up; Cars 2 may not be Toy Story but it sure is FUN and ENTERTAINING.",
    "I am truly sadden that this film got bashed so much. I hear reviews saying this film \"sucks\" or it has too many inaccuracies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List have also \"some\" inaccuracies in them. (They are Masterpieces) It is pretty sad this film has been getting this bashed. It doesn't deserve to be.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is full of suspense and is directed beautifully by Kathryn Bigelow. I'd have to say this is movie truly captures the Iraq War. What a dangerous war it was for our soldiers. This movie shows us what our soldiers went through. This isn't bashing the American soldiers at all or even War. It gives us a great deal of appreciation for our troops who are risking their lives every single day for Us, Freedom and the U.S.A.<br/><br/>The true purpose of this movie is to not just praise the soldiers. But for one of the military's unrecognized heroes which are the technicians of the bombs squads who risk their lives to save others. This is the purpose of the movie to let everyone know what these people do.<br/><br/>This time and I know all of you out there, don't want to hear it, the critics are actually right. This movie is fantastically directed by Kathryn Bigelow and she rightfully deserved her Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>I know many Avatar fans out there probably rated this movie a 1, without even seeing it because it won Best Picture and Avatar didn't. This movie seems its suffering from the curse of Best Picture. More people have watched Avatar than the Hurt Locker. So of course this film has gotten bashed by so many. I think SOME of the bad reviews are the Avatar Fanboys who are just angry Avatar didn't win Best Picture.<br/><br/>Please don't just go along with the bad reviews this film has gotten from IMDb. Just try and watch this film.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a war epic, that I hope it becomes appreciative as time passes. 9/10 Highly recommended.",
    "It's funny, but I notice most of the prior comments are from guys, but speaking as a woman, this is by no means just a guy's flick. It's been one of my favorite films since the day it came out. It's got everything- drama, romance, action, and an honest to goodness story. There are even interesting themes, like the moral dilemma that Wyatt finds himself in-- Is he compelled to help fight the Cowboys even though he's \"retired\" and just wants to live out his life in peace? Is there a moral equivalence between killing for justice and killing for retribution? How far can a man go to sacrifice his own integrity and better judgment? Even though the Earps are the \"good guys\", the movie doesn't glamorize violence. Doc Holliday and some of the Earps' other sidekicks (\"Creek Johnson\" and \"Texas Jack\") are obviously pretty shady characters, but at the end of the day, are forced to choose between right and wrong, and they choose correctly. It doesn't get much better than Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't get nominated for it. I also appreciate the fact that the love story between Wyatt and Josephine didn't dominate the film and take away from the real plot, ala \"Titanic\". The love story simply served its purpose in helping viewers to better understand the character of Wyatt. Also the friendship between Wyatt and Doc was portrayed tenderly but not wussily. And okay, as a woman, let me just say that there is no one sexier than Sam Elliot. Man alive, if there ever was a person born to portray a cowboy, that guy is IT. If you've never seen a Western, or are not a fan, try this movie. It will make a believer out of you.",

    "SAW III in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series. For many reasons- one reason being that it keeps it simple. Instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in SAW's II, IV, and V, SAW III, like the original, has much fewer characters, leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone. And while it does have sub-plots, they don't feel out of place, they're not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences. They feel organic, they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to why.<br/><br/>If you've seen a SAW film, you know the story is going to have twists, turns, and violence/gore to accompany them. But at least SAW III does it very well. It expands on characterization and back stories for these characters and ties up the loose ends as believably as this franchise can do. We also get a deeper look at the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, knowing more about how the two really look at each other. Jigsaw is the calm, cancer-stricken anti-hero who does these evil things to prove a moral standpoint. Amanda, on the other hand, doesn't seem to grasp this - instead using the traps to torture her victims as a way to get back at innocent people for the way she was tortured herself with suicidal tendencies and drug abuse. With these two extremes, we see how much Jigsaw is trying to mentor her in his vision while she struggles with her own demons. And when Jigsaw gets ill, we see that Amanda really isn't a fitting apprentice to carry on his legacy as her vindictiveness comes out.<br/><br/>SAW III is also supported by the fact that the two protagonists are developed deeply. Maybe not as much as our two anti-heros, but we understand where they're coming from. From Lynn's dour nature to devastated Jeff's situation. The subplot with Jeff by the way adds some great underlying messages to the film. These messages shows us that hate, vengeance, revenge, and complacency brings more pain than anything else, and does not solve anything. It ruins families, destroys relationships, clouds judgment, and at the end: self-destruction. Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two films with James Waan and flew solo writing the screenplay for this one, does a nice job giving the spotlight to all the characters instead of just focusing on Jigsaw and Amanda. He makes SAW III more of a character study than any of the other installments and that's one of the essential reasons why this installment scores high.<br/><br/>Darren Lynn Bousman directs a much more subtle film than he did with SAW II and SAW IV. The quick edits are kept to a bare minimum (thank God) and the film has a lot of dread going for it. Very moody and darkly atmospheric. He focuses on the drama and emotion at hand, which was a vast improvement on SAW II and especially SAW IV. He lets the acting and the situations do the work for him instead of being extra-fancy with the camera work. Lastly, the cinematography is a plus. Darren shoots the film with a vibrant and kinetic feel and uses good, non-queasy camera movements. I love the lighting most of all though; he uses a wide arrange in the color palette (from lime green to icy blue). He definitely proves here that he knows how to grasp the material and visualize it. His direction of III ranks alongside James Waan's mindblowing direction of the original.<br/><br/>The acting is hardly an issue. It's usually good or better. Tobin Bell can play John Kramer in his sleep by now for gods sake! He shows excellent range and is always effective in the role because he gives the character more depth than what the script probably provides. Shawnee Smith is superb as Amanda, who will always be one of my favorite characters in the series. This is without a single doubt her shining moment, her most dramatic portion in the series. You really want to hate her but you just can't because you pity her. Smith could have easily played the character as an annoying nutjob, but she gives the character substance and unbelievable humanality. Angus Macfadyen as Jeff is superb in his role as well; he makes Jeff the most realistic and sympathetic character within the entire series. As far as I'm concerned, McFayden nailed the mourning father act. Bahar Soomekh was decent but always outshone by Bell, Smith, and McFayden. Her acting was a bit flimsy at times, but for the most part she gave a nice performance and made her character likable.<br/><br/>The suspense and tension, while not as impressive as the original, is still great. Hardly any other Saw film or horror film in general for that matter (with the exception of Eden Lake from last year and Inside from 2007) has been so edge-of-your-seat gripping, so exciting. The slow pacing allows you to gradually absorb everything in, and this makes it all the more better.<br/><br/>There is a lot of extreme gore in this film, but unlike some other installments like Saws IV and V, it's done very well and serves a purpose. Jeff's bloody trials are in a lot of ways cathartic. You're enduring these horrific scenes along with Jeff, and the relief at the end that the horror is over really fits with the theme of redemption through forgiveness. Moreover, the revelation that the horror isn't over, and what you feel as a result, drives home the Shakespearean tragedy in a very personal way because you the audience have to keep enduring it.<br/><br/>SAW III is clever, solidly written, has the best characters, succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for, and ties up loose ends perfectly. For a third installment in a horror series, it's incredibly strong.",
    "And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive \"Spider-Man\" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.",

Sure she could be scared (of being revealed to be a fraud by the true her) but not of a shadow. Again, purposeful misleading to set up the twist.<br/><br/>3. Why does the good version go insane and deciude the only way to get revenge on her evil self is to raise an army of evil duplicates that murder their good halves? Again, contrived and makes no sense.<br/><br/>4. Why didn't/ couldn't the good version of the girl use the escalators to escape the evil realm? This really doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>5. How the hell did all of the evil versions have enough food/ water to survive?<br/><br/>6. Surely not every single copy of everyone in the world was stored in the one bunker shown. So how did the \"Good\" girl convince all of the evil copies (of all the rest of the world) to arise??<br/><br/>There are probably many many MANY more issues with this film. But god does it destroy itself trying way too hard to set up a profound twist that is just completely illogical.",
    "Don't believe the negative reviews on this one. Its easily the most underrated movie I have come across, and can best be described as a hidden gem for the ones who like historical adventure/action-movies (Braveheart/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/Robin Hood) and fantasy-movies. <br/><br/>Others have described it better here on IMDb, so I am just going to say this: It is not a historical correct piece, and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy, even though the vikings portrayed and their buildings/settlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.<br/><br/>Btw: To all you who like the above-mentioned movies for the big battle-scenes and sword-fighting, don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area (even though it got them). On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in pre-medieval times. Instead of having the one super-hero defying all logic, you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie, with Banderas, Storhøi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.<br/><br/>This is a great adventure of a movie, which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.<br/><br/>9/10 - Must see for all who like adventure/fantasy",
    "Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.<br/><br/>The good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.<br/><br/>The actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.<br/><br/>The bad. Since it's so bizarre, it won't please everyone.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don't think you'll see your run of the mill kind of film and you'll have fun.",
    "I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on \"the list\" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like \"Superbad\", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of \"40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Superbad\", or \"Knocked Up\".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the \"TV actors on the big screen\" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of \"That 70s Show\" didn't follow her to \"Forgetting\"'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that \"Forgetting\" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than \"American Psycho 2\" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on \"CSI\") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious \"American Psycho 2\"); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with \"Superbad\"). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt \"Knocked Up\"). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write \"Fun with Dick and Jane\".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",
    "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:<br/><br/>First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?<br/><br/>Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.<br/><br/>During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",
    "I was talked into seeing this, and I have to shout it out, because it is a RIOT! I don't write many reviews, but when I love a film, I have to. If I have any complaint on this one, it's the title. I expected gross-out humor (\"crude\"). There isn't any, really. It's actually extremely unpredictable, subtle and extremely smart humor.<br/><br/>It has a story arc that you begin to somewhat anticipate, but you don't feel you're being patronized. Instead, you're left feeling that very intelligent people put this thing together in hopes that everyone would find something to love about it.<br/><br/>The cast is great, the animation is fun, and it's non-dizzying 3-D.<br/><br/>When I saw it, the entire audience clapped at the end, because we were entertained throughout, and found the ending really satisfying.<br/><br/>What else? Sweet emotions crop up because we can all relate to the family dynamics. Every family has the screw-up, the salt of the earth, the rebel, and the stubborn one. And it has one of the funniest babies ever put on film. A baby unlike any baby you'll ever see anywhere.<br/><br/>Very, very funny. Definitely recommend.",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! <br/><br/>10/10",
    "\"Atonement\" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class comedy of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and accidentally sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison. <br/><br/>In Act II, set in 1940, Robbie, released from jail, is now a soldier with the British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans, kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becoming estranged from her family as a result. In Act III we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.<br/><br/>After \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \"Becoming Jane\", James McEvoy is the rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the best yet that I have seen. Whereas Dr Garrigan in \"The Last King\" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in \"Becoming Jane\" hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in conveying his character's basic decency, achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and this is her second film with director Joe Wright after \"Pride and Prejudice\". Although she was good in the comedy \"Bend it like Beckham\", I think that her films with Wright are her best, suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" in which she seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film I have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and to Vanessa Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the epilogue, set in 1999. I felt, however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a good film, but \"Atonement\" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years, and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances. One of its themes in particular, the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps McEwan's final twist, although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, however, the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel, Wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination, something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels. \"Atonement\" joins that list of films (\"Far from Heaven\" and \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" are other examples that come to mind) where almost every scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of Act II, where Wright can find a terrible beauty even in war, especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the Dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light. Particularly moving was the scene where the British soldiers sing \"Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\". The second line of John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course, \"Forgive Our Foolish Ways\"- a particularly apt comment on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Also very good was Dario Marianelli's musical score, which (appropriately for a film in which writing plays an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and late summer (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it comes to next year's Oscars. 9/10",

    "Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised \" Esther's secret\" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the \"secret\" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a \"creepy\" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",
    "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.<br/><br/>At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.<br/><br/>There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",

    "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original \"Willy Wonka\" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",

    "Mass amateurization refers to the capabilities that new forms of media have given to non-professionals and the ways in which those non-professionals have applied those capabilities to solve problems (e.g. create and distribute content) that compete with the solutions offered by larger, professional institutions. Mass amateurization is most often associated with Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies include the rise of blogs and citizen journalism, photo and video-sharing services such as Flickr and YouTube, user-generated wikis like Wikipedia, and distributed accommodation services such as Airbnb. While the social web is not the only technology responsible for the rise of mass amateurization, Clay Shirky claims Web 2.0 has allowed amateurs to undertake increasingly complex tasks resulting in accomplishments that would seem daunting within the traditional institutional model. In addition to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed a variety of digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, trackbacks, and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during the first decade of the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.",

    "Bass–Serre theory is a part of the mathematical subject of group theory that deals with analyzing the algebraic structure of groups acting by automorphisms on simplicial trees. The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of free product with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass–Serre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory. History\nBass–Serre theory was developed by Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970s and formalized in Trees, Serre's 1977 monograph (developed in collaboration with Hyman Bass) on the subject. Serre's original motivation was to understand the structure of certain algebraic groups whose Bruhat–Tits buildings are trees. However, the theory quickly became a standard tool of geometric group theory and geometric topology, particularly the study of 3-manifolds. Subsequent work of Bass contributed substantially to the formalization and development of basic tools of the theory and currently the term \"Bass–Serre theory\" is widely used to describe the subject.",
    "Hemoglobin Barts, abbreviated Hb Barts, is an abnormal type of hemoglobin that consists of four gamma globins. It is moderately insoluble, and therefore accumulates in the red blood cells. Hb Barts has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, so it cannot release oxygen to the tissue. Therefore, this makes it an inefficient oxygen carrier. As an embryo develops, it begins to produce alpha-globins at weeks 5–6 of development. When both of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes which code for alpha globins becomes dysfunctional, the affected fetuses will have difficulty in synthesizing a functional hemoglobin. As a result, gamma chains will accumulate and form four gamma globins. These gamma globins bind to form hemoglobin Barts. It is produced in the disease alpha-thalassemia and in the most severe of cases, it is the only form of hemoglobin in circulation. In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis and normally die before or shortly after birth, unless intrauterine blood transfusion is performed. Since hemoglobin Barts is elevated in alpha thalassemia, it can be measured, providing a useful screening test for this disease in some populations.",

    "High Angle Control System (HACS) was a British anti-aircraft fire-control system employed by the Royal Navy from 1931 onwards and used widely during World War II. HACS calculated the necessary deflection required to place an explosive shell in the location of a target flying at a known height, bearing and speed. Early history\nThe HACS was first proposed in the 1920s and began to appear on Royal Navy (RN) ships in January 1930, when HACS I went to sea in . HACS I did not have any stabilization or power assist for director training. HACS III which appeared in 1935, had provision for stabilization, was hydraulically driven, featured much improved data transmission and it introduced the HACS III Table. The HACS III table (computer) had numerous improvements including raising maximum target speed to 350 knots, continuous automatic fuze prediction, improved geometry in the deflection Screen, and provisions for gyro inputs to provide stabilization of data received from the director. The HACS was a control system and was made possible by an effective data transmission network between an external gun director, a below decks fire control computer, and the ship's medium calibre anti-aircraft (AA) guns.",

Typically, the different types of asset-based loans include accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, equipment financing, or real estate financing Asset-based lending in this more specific sense is possible only in certain countries whose legal systems allow borrowers to pledge such assets to lenders as collateral for loans (through the creation of enforceable security interests). Usage\nAsset-based lending is usually done when the normal routes of raising funds is not possible, such as the capital markets (selling bonds to investors) and normal unsecured or mortgage secured bank. This is often because the company has exhausted other capital raising options or needs more immediate capital for project financing needs (such as inventory purchases, mergers, acquisitions, and debt purchasing). Asset-based loans are also usually accompanied by lower interest rates, as in the event of a default the lender can recoup its investment by seizing and liquidating the assets tied to the loan.",

The simplest, or most evasive, approach is RAM-scraping, accessing the system's memory and exporting the copied information via a remote access trojan (RAT) as this minimizes any software or hardware tampering, potentially leaving no footprints. POS attacks may also include the use of various bits of hardware: dongles, trojan card readers, (wireless) data transmitters and receivers. Being at the gateway of transactions, POS malware enables hackers to process and steal thousands, even millions, of transaction payment data, depending upon the target, the number of devices affected, and how long the attack goes undetected. This is done before or outside of the card information being (usually) encrypted and sent to the payment processor for authorization. List of POS RAM scraper malware variants",

    "Michael van Gerwen (; born 25 April 1989) is a Dutch professional darts player. He is currently ranked number three in the world, having been world number one from 2014 to 2021. He is also a three-time PDC World Champion, having won the title in 2014, 2017 and 2019.  Van Gerwen began playing darts at the age of 13. He won the 2006 World Masters and threw a televised nine-dart finish at the 2007 Masters of Darts, becoming the youngest player to do both, aged 17. However, after this initial burst onto the darting scene, van Gerwen struggled for consistent form until his breakthrough year in 2012. Improving from world number 38 at the start of 2012 to number four at the beginning of 2013, he won his first major PDC title at the World Grand Prix and reached the final at the 2013 World Championship. In 2014, at the age of 24, van Gerwen became the youngest winner of the PDC World Championship, a record he still holds today, as well as being one of only five players to win it more than once. He also holds the record for the highest three-dart average in a televised darts match, with 123.4.",
    "Chakán (, ‘1) oregano of this land; 2) macaw tail feathers.’) is the name of one of the Mayan jurisdictions (kuchkabalob) that existed on the Yucatan Peninsula at the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the sixteenth century. Unlike other jurisdictions, Chakán did not seem to have a centralized government or control of a dominant Halach Uinik, as in the case of the provinces Ceh Pech or Ah Kin Chel. This is inferred from the fact that upon the Spaniards' arrival, Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo) was well received by some local leaders (batabob), but not others, such as Ah Kin Chuy, who organized resistance in the region's eastern towns to repel Spanish settlers. The most important city in the jurisdiction may have been Caucel, which controlled the region's salt trade since this material came from Chuburná and Sisal. Caucel's batab, named Ah Kin Euán, was so open to the Spanish from the outset of the conquest that he converted to Catholicism and changed his name to Francisco Euán, maintaining his position as batab for much longer.",

    "European exploration and settlement of Oceania began in the 16th century, starting with Portuguese settling the Moluccas and Spanish (Castilian) landings and shipwrecks in the Marianas Islands, east of the Philippines, followed by the Portuguese landing and settling  temporarily (due to the monsoons) in the Tanimbar or the Aru Islands and in some of the Caroline Islands and Papua New Guinea, and several Spanish landings in the Caroline Islands and New Guinea. Subsequent rivalry between European colonial powers, trade opportunities and Christian missions drove further European exploration and eventual settlement. After the 17th century Dutch landings in New Zealand and Australia, but not settling these lands, the British became the dominant colonial power in the region, establishing settler colonies in what would become Australia and New Zealand, both of which now have majority European-descended populations. States including New Caledonia (Caldoche), Hawaii, French Polynesia and Norfolk Island also have considerable European populations. Europeans remain a primary ethnic group in much of Oceania, both numerically and economically. European settlement and colonization"

    "Advocacy learning has demonstrated strong promise for many domains and we are rapidly becoming accustomed to applying this approach. However, few datasets have been studied experimentally with adversarial training such as the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task, which includes more than 500 million trials over almost two decades. Here, we propose an approach that allows generating ad-hoc networks through supervised, unconstrained sampling, enabling robust training even on data not suitable or appropriate for other methods. As in previous approaches (e.g., refs. 25⇓–27), our framework is based upon factorisation of the latent representations of discrete classes into more interpretable clusters by reducing their inter-class similarity; however, by adopting an extra layer between these hidden states, our generative model can represent high dimensional features efficiently without being trained in advance.\n\nThese ideas also appear in Nils Brauer's work, The Design (or Lack thereof) Of Learning From Imperfect Data; A Perspective On Support Vector Machines With Generalization Problems, but they're more developed here, with some really neat implementation examples at the end.

    "We present a new method of visualizing semantic relationships between visual features and language in scenes using semantic segmentation. Our system's high degree of generativity makes it a suitable candidate for visualizing complex relationships in a generative picture language.\n\nOur work is based primarily on the theory of visualizing the semantic relationships between features in scenes, inspired by the ideas in Büchner et al.'s Theories of Semantic Visualization thesis [1]. We consider the problem of visualizing semantic relationships between two visual features, such as an object and an object feature respectively. This approach is inspired by visualizing the semantic relationships between visual features in the natural world (see this paper for further details) when considering the relationships of two complex, spatially distributed sequences of features. In particular, we consider the problem of visualizing a semantic relationship between, for example, a location and a location feature (here, the features at two locations on the scene).\n\nFor example, consider two examples:\n\nA scene in which there are, in addition to the location feature, six features corresponding to motion direction.\n\nA non-artistic scene in which there are, in addition to the location feature, three features corresponding to time of day.\n\nWe are presented with a way to visualize relationships between these two situations with respect to the feature sequence of the non-artistic scene. For the purposes of illustration we are only interested in the question of whether there is a spatial relationship in the visual features of the two scenes.\n\nWe present general techniques we use to solve this problem, which in the future may be used effectively to perform similar tasks on scenes from diverse genres, different disciplines, and with different features, in different domains.\n\nOur results show that our method does produce a well-organized graph where the semantic relationships within a given image sequence is well preserved across different scenes. Moreover, our results show that the semantics of an image sequence can be visualized through a visual representation of its semantic relationships. This visualization technique provides a means for the visualization of semantic relationships between a visual feature in a scene. When visualized, the semantic relationships can be compared visually to visual features from different, different domains, such as music visualizations, or even a 3D scene rendered from various types of data.\n\nThe Semantic",

The algorithm is based on the fact that the distance between any pair of points in Euclidean space is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances between them. We show that this result holds even if we assume that the set of points has no boundary. This implies that the C-W equivalence is equivalent to the Euclidean equivalence. In particular, it follows that the C-W equivalence is equivalent to the Euclidean equivalence when the distance between two points is less than or equal to the square root of 2.",

The obvious solution to the equation is to use an approximate interpolation, but those methods can be computationally expensive, if not prohibitively so for small data sets.

This is called 'chebyverification', and while it isn't as common as other problems of this nature (e.g., rewriting every time using brute force), it can still be disastrous. To see why it happens so frequently (and worse than before by over 5X), we will present some examples, show how they arise naturally with various analytic choices, and illustrate where optimization strategies might be developed to avoid them.

    "Non-Measurable Unions in the Presence of Arbitrary Nonlinearity\n\nIn this work, we study the effect of arbitrary nonlinearity on the behavior of non-measurable unions. We show that if one has an arbitrary nonlinearity, then the union of two sets of elements can be described by a linear combination of these sets. This means that the union of two sets of elements can be described as a sum of linear combinations of their components. In other words, the union of two sets of elements can be described as a linear combination of their component sums. The existence of such a linear combination implies that there exists a set of all possible linear combinations of the union of two sets of elements. If one has an arbitrary nonlinearity, then it follows that the union of two sets of elements cannot be described by any linear combination of its components. Thus, the union of two sets of elements cannot be described as a linear combination of their component sums.\n\nWe prove that the above statement holds even when the union of two sets of elements is not commutative and that the above statement holds even when the union of two sets of elements is not associative.\n\nThis work was done with the help of the following resources:",

    "In this work we investigate the use of high dimensional sparse filters for image filtering, focusing on the problem of image filtering with noisy data and limited capacity. We show how to apply this filtering method to a range of applications in image processing, particularly deep learning, by building a scalable BNF-like model that can adaptively learn to deal with the noisy data, and by employing the high-dimensional sparse linear algebra to efficiently scale up image filtering. Our model learns to handle arbitrary sparsely shaped data efficiently, using a high dimensional non-linearity in the input space and high dimensional non-linearity in the output space. The result is efficient implementation of simple filtering algorithms and a complete characterization of the framework's performance. In particular, we show for a range of image datasets, both for both real and n-dimensional sparse data, that training is achievable through a combination of parallel filtering and parallel sparse linear algebra. Our results also show that this system can be extended to handle large datasets, without requiring additional feature engineering.\n\nWe demonstrate two main results. First, we make use of the scaling technique proposed in this article, to achieve efficient scaling of high-dimensional sparse linear algebra representations on a GPU. Second, our framework can also provide an alternative form of feature engineering that allows the model to learn to do a variety of filtering tasks, such as bilinear filtering, soft and hard soft-edge detection, and fuzzy feature engineering.\n\nThe video gives a good description of the research, showing a few examples of both the parallel and the parallel sparse linear algebra pipelines.\n\nI want to thank Paul Chudnovsky and Ben DeZeeuw for helpful discussions, and I would like to extend a huge thank you to Alex Graves and his folks at Deep Learning Systems for making this work possible.

    "This paper presents the implementation of the adversarial constraint-based CNN with a large vocabulary. In contrast with previous efforts we employ fully connected components, which allows us to achieve better performance under unsupervised, multi-label classification tasks. All of our classes are implemented in the fully connected layer based on the adversarial constraint-based training framework proposed in [Sharma19][Keen21]. However, unlike traditional adversarial training, the CNN is trained directly and never participates in the learning process. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy in the unsupervised task in two different images of the same patient based only on the original CNN structure and using a large natural vocabulary. Using the adversarial structure, each CNN class is trained with different weights, and the resulting loss of each type of CNN is computed. Our approach achieves robustness and speed in comparison with the traditional approach.\n\nThis is definitely a big first step in the AI space here, and while they say this will be implemented in a medical imaging application, you could easily run the same approach on any subject, especially in the domain of medical imaging, which needs some type of classification to distinguish between healthy and sick people. From where we are standing, we can't tell you exactly how that will play out in the real world, but we're not exactly betting against it having some serious, positive effects.\n\n[image credit: iStock]",

    "High-dimensional estimating equations (HEDE) have broad applications, in the domains of biomedical drug discovery, biophysical dynamics, and environmental economics. The generalization techniques that have allowed us to create high-dimensional HEDE models are not very useful, at least in practice. To gain a practical insight on the difficulties we have encountered in doing so, we present a numerical example of the process we have been describing, along with two variants (with different numbers of dimension) where it is not possible to solve the equations. We also present a proof of the completeness of the technique. Our analysis focuses on the case where an arbitrary data set can be represented as a sum of \"subspaces\" containing \"values,\" and are not constrained to have certain properties. We propose a more general strategy to estimate models, to be used with higher-dimensional data sets that have at least the dimension that is needed. We show that with such data, we can model many important phenomena in physics and biology, notably biological macromolecular interactions, electrochemical and molecular dissociation, and non-equilibrium electron transfer processes. While a certain amount of computational effort is necessary in the case of simple models without constraints on the size of the spatial dimensions of the model, our approach is well suited for models with arbitrary spatial dimensions.\n\nThe full paper has been published in Nature Communications: \"Hierarchical and Multidimensional Estimating Equations for Physical Models with High Dimensionality.\"\n\nI've always been a huge fan of the idea of \"higher order approximations\" – in particular, the idea that we can use higher level approximations and use them to do things we could not do before.

I have been watching this potential (and I have to say I am not disappointed) with a mixture of glee and trepidation, and I'm excited to be part of the DFT effort (and excited to see what comes of it)",

We find that DM articles tend to be more negative than those about other fields, but this effect is not significant when we control for the number of citations to these articles. In addition, we show that the bias is driven by the fact that Wikipedia articles about academics have fewer references to their work than do articles about other disciplines. These results suggest that Wikipedia's focus on the humanities may lead it to produce an overly positive view of academia.\nThis is a very interesting study. I think it does a good job of showing how Wikipedia can skew the way people perceive certain topics. It also shows that there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of how Wikipedia presents information about academics. For example, if you look at the article on the University of California system, it says that UC Berkeley is one of the top ten universities in the world, yet it doesn't mention that they're ranked #1 in the US. That would be a much better representation of what the university actually is.\nI'm sure there will be some who say that this isn't really relevant because Wikipedia is just a collection of random links to other websites. But I don't see how that could possibly be true. If Wikipedia was just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it had a problem? And if Wikipedia were just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why didn't anyone notice that it was being edited by a group of editors with a clear agenda?\nIf Wikipedia is just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it had a problem?\nAnd if Wikipedia is just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it was being edited by a group of editors with a clear agenda?\nIt seems like a pretty big deal that Wikipedia is being used as a source of information about academics.

    "Abstract While much has been written about prompt generation for DEL, it remains highly problematic to reliably produce the output given many different environment parameters - some difficult and others obvious like an ENV variable's value and configuration of.NET's eventing infrastructure. The primary problem can be summarized as follows: To obtain reliable and predictable outputs from simple, dynamic input, a generator should be composed to use standard environment variables where possible and otherwise invoke built in function such as shell commands or batch file parsing that does not rely on the current environment. In addition to being less error prone because one does not need to make hard assumptions on the input, this design methodology reduces reliance on libraries (such as CSPRNGs ) which are susceptible to changes during runtime in order to exploit specific inputs within the program. However this approach still requires careful manual effort to ensure no data gets accidentally overwritten because any number of errors can result when entering unknown variables while running DEVELOPER'S CHILD with some kind of custom logic involving INPUT's,.NET's Eventing Frameworks, etc.\nWhile there are multiple approaches to dynamically create these environments (often named \"Del\", \"DELIMEPLATIONER \", \"dynamic prompt generation \" or even just DEL_SEARCH_DEPL) they invariably fall short due to the necessity (at least in my experience) of ensuring most of the initial input contains a string like /bin/bash in its name. This makes them extremely resource intensive, expensive in terms of CPU usage, require having an entire interpreter to run on your computer and, as a side effect, limits their flexibility due to the fact that most people have limited familiarity with how languages work internally until they actually need to interact with those languages to generate an environment out of input. Since I'm looking at the topic as a programmer who is very concerned with maintaining his programming language knowledge through active practice so while these features may get new features added quickly into existing programming environments they won't necessarily change something that is fundamental to what I take pride in when using an existing programming language. While most of us will probably never see that feature enabled by default within our editors, IDEs or other programs we often do need to enter inputs that start with bash ; or command line arguments that start with \\; etc. But how often do we encounter prompts from",

We present a statistical model that quantifies the contribution of dental biofilms to oral health by using a novel approach based on the analysis of data from a large cohort of patients with periodontal diseases. Our results show that dental biofilms contribute significantly to the development of periodontitis, whereas they do not affect the severity or persistence of gum disease. The model also shows that the presence of dental biofilms does not predict the risk of developing periodontitis.

    "\"In this paper, we present a new approach for facial landmark detection, based on deep learning, that combines multiple deep neural networks into a single super-trained system for facial landmark recognition. Our system can learn to extract landmarks from any object feature image, including ones that are not directly visible, or for example when a human's face is obscured by an object. We present extensive analyses showing that our algorithm can accurately predict facial landmark attributes in the absence of extensive landmark knowledge, and also demonstrate its ability to converge on a human-recognized human face. Our data set is enriched with a relatively large number of human faces that are well known to both computer vision researchers and general users, which makes our task interesting for both researchers and users.\n\nThe current state of facial recognition technologies is centered around automated analysis of images, mainly from online sources. While human recognition, also known as face detection, is an important research topic for the future, the current state of automated computer vision has focused on simple face detection, such as recognizing face, or face contours; detecting the distance between two objects; or recognizing a single shape features. The aim of this work is to find a more comprehensive approach or paradigm for facial detection, which will enable computer vision research to be carried out in a more advanced manner in the near future. Our proposed approach uses several deep learning models to represent the features of the human face, and combines these with the knowledge of each feature in order to model the user's facial expressions, thereby creating a novel facial detection framework. The proposed approach enables machine learning to deal with complex and diverse problems, ranging from tracking the facial movements of faces, to detecting facial distortions. Our results support the idea that deep learning has the potential to increase computational efficiency and make computer vision accessible to a large community of researchers.\n\nThe goal of this work is to demonstrate that deep learning achieves super-realtime facial landmark detection. With this approach, the neural networks can learn to discover landmarks on the basis of unsupervised feature learning, to achieve a state-of-the-art performance of 6.4% in a task where only 20% of the images were annotated with landmark boundaries. To demonstrate the validity of our work, we analyzed the accuracy and accuracy of our proposed approach against the state-of-the-art of existing",
    "Observations of an EXO-200 background in radioactive rock obtained from the Mt. Baker–Snoqualmie National Monument in Washington State indicate that the emission of radioactivity from the radioactive geochemistry of the rock is significantly higher than that of natural geological sources, probably due to a very high rate of radioactive decay in the rock. This background has been detected at a number of distances from the source, implying that the background must arise from a physical process, possibly due to the interaction between the geochemistry of the rock and an external field. A comparison between the background-induced emissions and background values of ambient background radiation suggests that the background was generated by radioiodine decay.\n\nThe article also includes the following short, but very useful, video clip from a presentation called \"How a Geologist Obtains a Radioactive Background for Exo-200\" by David M.

    "\"Our main idea in this paper is about the efficient evaluation of a compact version of product or product space. According to this strategy, a compact space consists of a set of linear products, and a set of linear filters over this set. Here, linear maps are used to specify the compactness property of the (filtered) compact set of products, which are known as product space. In our case, we evaluate the composition of a linear map with the product space itself by selecting at random a linear map of all fixed dimensions. In contrast to other work, we do not specify, at first sight, a specific choice of \"product\", but rather take the property of nonlinearity of the filters. Such a property, which is not known to the author of such analysis, is not easily definable by using finite series or other traditional nonlinearity tests. In addition to the usual nonlinearity tests, we also take advantage of the property of compactness to the filter, which gives a good approximation to the nonlinearity. As a consequence, using a product space as an efficient (or inefficient) measure for the nonlinearity of a filter is both correct and a generalization of the usual nonlinearity tests from regularity to compactness. Concretely, we first introduce an optimization scheme that we call \"narrower product space,\" which we prove that a compact compact collection of products (or products of filters) will be compact if and only if both this compact collection and the selected filter have a finite complement. In other words, the selection of a filter in the product space must be as specific as that of a linear map in the collection space. A generalization of our method is that any fixed pair of linear maps can be selected without restriction by simply selecting random elements from the selection between them. Moreover, given a \"filter\" and some product space, we show that this product space is always compact, and thus compact in any sense in which product space is defined in an efficient and general way. \"\n\n\nHere is an animation of our proof in practice:",

In this way, data can be transmitted without loss or errors over distances exceeding several kcm. We address other challenges such as high quality interconnects, energy management and efficient use of laser power.

    "In this work we address a novel form of sputter on polar surfaces, where multiple particles are produced by light trapped within a rotating beam cavity. The result can be defined as an interference pattern, which may show up either symmetrically with respect to the orientation of particle origin/destination or asymmetric. Similar results were obtained previously using light trapping on metallic surfaces using a highly modified type of rotary tunneling microscope (MTM) [4], which permitted a large number of particle pairs in exchange (see Methods). In particular, we exploit this method on thin film graphene prepared in a three-dimensional channel. When one single pair of electrons is transferred across each graphene molecule at a single energy level, an electric potential difference and electromagnetic force arise between two adjacent pairs, that induces their formation in the same direction. As in the case of optical trapping on the metal substrate, we observe a rotation and sputtering effect at much lower frequencies when several such pairs occur in simultaneous locations along a given longitudinal axis [5]. At low atomic voltage (~8 eV), the resulting forces lead to emission waves emanating from nearby electrode locations (E i and E j ) that propagate along the surface, generating a complex system of correlated electronic charge density fluctuations that propagate outwardly throughout the entire sample length. These electric fields are more prevalent near edge regions due to the polarization angle between charged electron centers and oxygen atoms that is slightly different from the normal polarity of oxygen molecules. Since both center charges have approximately 180° symmetry, they create opposite electrical currents and magnetic moments, similar to those found for circular polarized beams (e.g., CVDs; Fig. 3a) whose induced electromagnetic field tends to push electrons toward one another. Thus for our experimental probe setup, only the most intense energy levels are capable of driving these effects on solid films on both sides of a vertical plane perpendicular to the original direction of motion. We also find that while all electron emissions generated upon interaction are directed away from the electrodes owing to the current dependence, the emitted trajectories remain distinct in various orientations depending on the applied directional magnetic field. Because spatial separation and polarization are extremely important parameters in the underlying mechanism (i.e., interparticle electric dipoles during particle generation and then recombination and spin dynamics), they determine how spatially separated excitations generate a complex wavefield with distinctive",

    "In this article we show how to ensure that parallel computations achieve their goal: they are evaluated serially on the same datapoints, and their results are evaluated at the same point in time. Although a parallel implementation may be possible in some cases; in reality a parallel implementation usually requires the addition of some overhead. In this article we present the design and details about a new optimizer, which ensures that parallel computation always is uniform across datasets. This optimizer is based on the concept of Uniform Sparsity, which ensures that a set of parallel computations have the same distribution of their results. We show how to implement this optimizer in the language of Haskell, a language which, apart from its powerful type system, boasts some of the most efficient and robust parallel execution models to date. The optimizer is called \"Tortoise\", for obvious reasons.\n(A side story: one of the early authors of this paper was also a programmer who wrote the serializer for various.NET serializers – this lead to a meeting in which it was decided to name it \"Tortoise\".)\nIn the paper \"Sparsity and Parallel Acquisition: Optimal Uniform and Nonuniform Acceleration\" [pdf] it was found that uniformization is an essential requirement for many algorithms. In fact, linear algebraic and other such parallel algorithms require uniform parallel processing.\nWhile uniform parallelization leads to great performance, it has a negative impact on certain algorithms. On the other hand, uniform computation, by its very nature, produces a monotonic distribution of results, which results in lower latency – both for code reading and code writing. This fact is well documented, however, and in many cases we will see that the loss in performance is insignificant in many cases. This was the case for the fast algorithms in the paper. However, some slow algorithms were shown to benefit from uniformization. For example, the algorithm to split a list into two sorted lists, has a uniform time step in its parallel computation. But in practice this is not the case, and the parallel algorithm will not always achieve uniform time step on each invocation. The reason being that the algorithm performs much better on smaller lists.\nWhile performing parallel acquisition, the time can be divided into two parts: (1)\nA collection of data objects A collection",
    "Abstract A maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of abelians on different manifolds with topological invariant representations leads to remarkable results such as the creation of axioms of bifurcations at any abelian group. The axiomatics here are of relatively little interest, however, since they arise within an idealization of Banach algebras that can be represented by a single graph R(|R|). The current work extends the idea beyond the trivialization of this graph R using additional graphs R′′ which correspond both to higher order operators of the Lie algebra \\eta and its extension R(|φ|). The new theory generates unique monoidal structures called maximal abelian subalgebras over these extra 2-manifold graphs, where each vertex must correspond to a different operator. We provide some simple examples including one over the symmetric 4-topology B ( ρ | ϣ ) and three over B ( ⊗, π : p | γ ⟶ σ ). Here we prove important properties such as a proof of (1-)of universal completeness for all extensions of C*B to the above structure, and (2)-convexes in this general case. In fact, our results imply what might have been taken for granted only in the past century.\nAs explained earlier I know of much of the work involved in a somewhat less formalized context.

Our approach is inspired by the work (i) of Chown et al. [1] and refined upon them; and (ii) of Yudkowsky & Jirsa [2] who achieved the same effect using non-resolvable neural networks with no fixed size, allowing them to be trained via stochastic gradient descent in sparse images. However SynNet's learning rate is variable among layers, making it suitable for use at an intermediate level within a dataset requiring sparsely connected, high dimensional representations instead of just continuous features. For this reason we also provide implementations of SynNet for nlmsolver [3], the OpenCog[4], VGG[5], HUDS[6]; for example. SynNet implements both forward inference and backward propagation through time based prediction functions, which together achieve the same end goal while having independent advantages per problem domain: deep, invariant inference while retaining generality, and fast-paced prediction with improved accuracy if our initial predictions are not perfect. The main advantages of this technique lie in its compact implementation, which allows high precision training directly from the raw input image and efficient memory management (e.g., on CPU) for storing intermediate representations inside the recurrent connections and minimizing computation time. As mentioned before, it has been demonstrated to support state-of-the-art results and outperforms other techniques such as Gaussian processes on medical imaging tasks [7]. We also propose theoretical explanations to explain how our method achieves these impressive performances even though these theories can't explicitly account for all reasons why SynNet achieves comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art methods that combine many small hidden units into single layer networks but operate on mathematically equivalent classes of sequences.",
    "Introduction As in any domain, and particularly in medicine, data sets are continuously growing exponentially, and as many of these collections grow, so does the challenge in processing the huge amounts of training data they contain. What can be done to tackle this problem? How can we make it possible in practice for individuals to train models without having lots of time waiting at their machines (like for the famous PASCAL VOC), or the budget available for them, like for medical researchers (which happens sometimes)? In this work, we have studied two techniques which involve explicit information being fed into an implementation of neural networks on a graphical user interface to speed up analysis, i.e. the'small-sampling' method and the deep learning technique named for its use of multiple hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. In addition, it contains an optimisation scheme used to estimate parameters in some submodel during training. Both methods are trained upon MNIST dataset using random sampling. To illustrate our approach, some figures describing MNIST image labels showing both learning curves were generated for some specific examples: The two learning curves may give one the impression that what we achieved seems simple but it turns out that both approaches are quite complex, even when the objective functions remain straightforward. For example, our optimisation scheme tries to estimate the values of the latent variables for each subroutine separately. We then convert those values to weights for inference in the form of gradient descent. We also show how we compute a confidence interval around such estimates by setting the posterior distribution for each variable and applying our algorithm to the samples given by sampling from the expected probability distribution. Finally, because submodels will need to be learnt simultaneously on the first few observations only, many more neurons are required and so the total number of connections in the network does not exactly match the training number per subnetwork. Even after fitting a linear model, we still see overfitting leading to spurious predictions and false positives if some sub-models actually get underfit due to low coverage when actual error is high. This means it is often necessary to perform some type of regularisation to reduce overfitting while preserving precision before applying the regression-based optimization strategy mentioned earlier. Moreover, it should also be noted that such methods could benefit from further optimizations which we have discussed previously such as the optimization to account for interactions between components/functions",

We present an efficient method that uses labels propagation and refinement to achieve high accuracy on object classification tasks. Our approach achieves over 90% label error rate on a large dataset of videos. The proposed method can be applied to any task where we want to extract information about objects in video.",
    "Abstract The goal of this work was to investigate the effect of multiple targets on the non-coherence of MIMO radar with multiple targets (MIMO) and to determine whether the effects are due to the presence or absence of noise sources. We used an experimental setup consisting of two MIMO antennas, one located at each end of a 2m long optical fiber cable. A single target antenna was placed at the center of the cable. Two different types of noise sources were employed: a low frequency (LF) source that produces a continuous signal and a high frequency (HF) source that generates a periodic signal. In addition, we varied the number of targets per antenna. The results show that the LF source has no significant effect on the non-coherence of the system. However, when there are more than three targets, the HF source significantly reduces the non-coherence of the system. This reduction can be attributed to the fact that the RF energy emitted by the LF source is absorbed by the air molecules in the vicinity of the antenna. The results also indicate that the presence of noise sources does not affect the performance of the system.",
    "We present an approach to semantic segmentation that uses domain adaptation and a novel neural network architecture to achieve high-quality results in image classification tasks. We show how our method can be used to improve the accuracy of medical imaging diagnosis, by using it to extract features from images that are not directly visible to the human eye. Our algorithm achieves this by exploiting the fact that the brain has evolved to process visual information in a way that minimizes the amount of data needed to reconstruct the original scene. In particular, we exploit the fact that the brain's receptive field (the area of maximum activity) is highly correlated with its spatial resolution. This allows us to use the same feature space as the brain does, but with much smaller datasets. The resulting system is able to detect objects in images at resolutions up to 1 mm × 1 mm × 0.5 mm, which is comparable to the resolution of most commercial MRI scanners. Furthermore, our system is capable of detecting objects in images at resolutions up to 2 mm × 2 mm × 0.1 mm, which is comparable to the resolution of many commercially available 3D scanners. These results demonstrate that our technique can be applied to a wide range of problems involving image processing, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and face recognition.",

    "Abstract:\n\nWe have computed, over 10 different time scales, the sum of the average sum of the power fluxes of the sum of the strong decays of four types of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs): the light ones (the top 5% of the mass line), and two classes of heavier ones called b-mesons and muons. The WIMPs are emitted by black holes at the centers of quasar halos and in the core of active galactic nuclei. Here the WIMPs correspond to the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) line at energies between 11 and 16 TeV. By comparing the results with those from earlier studies, we show that the total emission from the four types of WIMPS during the 2023 summit is ~50,000 fb-1 cm-2 at a time interval of a few days. The summit-time spectrum (SST) is dominated by two type-I WIMPs. These are the heavy WIMPs that emit most of their radiation in the optical, and type-II WIMPs, which make up a large fraction of the light WIMP spectrum. The total peak-brightness of type-II WIMPs is significantly larger than from any other WIMP type. The total peak brightness of type-I WIMPs is significantly smaller than from any other WIMP type. We have found that the top two top qubit (type-I) WIMPs are the dominant top qubit radiation at time scales of the order of days. In addition, we have found the first direct evidence for a new WIMP category (type-I+IIb) that is slightly heavier than type-IIb WIMPs.\n\nFollow Ups:\n\nWe also had the opportunity to interview Daniel Roth, one of the co-authors.\n\nA version of this post was first published on Physics arXiv.",
    "Software-Defined Constrained Optimization (SDOCP) is an emerging field in which software engineers are able to design and implement algorithms that can be used to optimize routing protocols, such as Ethernet or IP. The goal of this work is to develop a new algorithm for optimizing SCOR on top of the existing SCOR protocol. We present a novel approach based on a combination of two techniques: (i) a probabilistic programming framework and (ii) a dynamic programming language. Our method allows us to define a set of constraints that describe how we want our network to behave, and then use these constraints to generate optimal solutions. This approach has several advantages over traditional approaches, including its ability to leverage the power of modern computer hardware. In particular, it enables us to efficiently compute the optimal solution even when the number of nodes in the network grows exponentially with time.",

    "Abstract The relative wavelength dependence of the IR lag in active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been studied extensively, but its significance remains unclear. Here we present an analysis of the IR lag in AGN using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the IR lag is independent of the distance to the galaxy and the type of star forming region within it. This result implies that the IR lag is not due to the presence of a large number of stars or gas clouds in the vicinity of the galaxy. Instead, our results suggest that the IR lag may be caused by the interaction between the interstellar medium and the interstellar magnetic field. Our results also indicate that the IR lag is significantly smaller than previously thought.",

We demonstrate that RBAL can be used to achieve high accuracy on tasks such as image classification and natural language processing. Our approach uses a novel priority map based on the hierarchical structure of the input data. The resulting models are able to learn to classify images with high accuracy even when they have been preprocessed. In addition, we show how our method can be applied to other types of data, including audio and video.",
    "In this story, a king's head is found in a river and it is claimed that he was beheaded by his own people. The king's son is sent to find out what happened to him. He finds the head on the shore of a lake and decides to take it home with him. However, when he tries to put it on, it falls off and lands in the water. When he goes back to retrieve it, he discovers that the head has been decapitated. He then realizes that the head must have fallen into the lake because there are no fish around. He returns to the castle where he meets the queen who tells him that she had been told about the head falling into the lake but did not believe her until she saw the head. She also says that the king's wife was killed by her husband so they could claim the throne. The king's son is furious at his father and wants revenge. He sets out to find the head and bring it back to the castle.\n\nI'm sure you can see how this would make for an interesting book. I've read several books like this before (most notably \"The Beheading of King Arthur\") and I always enjoy them. But I think this one might be my favorite. It's got a lot going on, including some very dark themes. And it's written in a way that makes me want to keep reading.\n\nSo here we go!\n\nPlot Summary:\n\nA young man named John is traveling through the countryside when he comes across a dead body floating in a stream. He picks up the corpse and carries it back to his house. There he puts the body inside a coffin and buries it under the floorboards. A few days later, he hears noises coming from the cellar. He opens the door and sees a woman standing over the body. She asks if he knows anything about the death of the man in the stream. John replies that he does not know anything about it. Then she points to the coffin and says that the body is still warm. John looks down and sees that the body is missing its head. He quickly takes the head out of the coffin and places it on top of the body. He then closes the lid and locks it. He then leaves the room and heads outside.

    "Synopsis in one word One, well…\n\nWhat follows in this story should not be taken as a review or appraisal of any particular aspect of the book's writing - though there are some things to like in it. These were just my observations, and I would encourage other critics to take their own stabs at these themes.\n\n\nWe begin with an epigraph which seems to serve no purpose but merely to amuse:\n\nTowards morning\n\nour dreams will die –\n\nat night all good men will be dead\n\nAll life is dust now – and that was before our birth. (Curt C. Wright)\n\nLet me break the dryness by providing you my thoughts on it:\n\nI feel guilty as hell about using this quote again! But there it is, so here goes: In what sense, do you think? First, Curt Wright is describing being born into the world for the first time; having your personality form out of nothing but dust is probably pretty much true too. He mentions later that the difference between us and others may turn out to be something akin to who we wake up as compared to ourselves, since he clearly has done enough to shape his future self, yet is still basically dust itself when it comes to remembering everything else. That might help explain why he calls himself a \"bad man.\" Yes, there were good, wise men living through him and then his birth in the past-time. We won't ever know what good they saw in him (perhaps they saw something they themselves lacked?), so perhaps it is better that in reality we'll never find out about them after we're gone. His bad days come and go almost constantly and his bad luck happens mostly outside of those moments (though sometimes it does happen inside of those times). On the subject of character development, the concept he presents is interesting in another way- it indicates one could even have such simple traits defined into two attributes, similar to how \"personality\" can become a trait for both sexes. (That would mean gender role differentiation becomes less significant in an age when most people consider the terms of their own sexuality moot.) There are also hints throughout the collection at Wright's awareness of more complex issues involved in choosing our personal fate - i.e., maybe he already realized some kind of God doesn't exist, or perhaps he was just a product of circumstances rather than someone",
    "In this book, the author explores the state of the art in computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) as it relates to the development of autonomous weapons systems. The book begins with an overview of current AI research and then examines the history of AI research and its impact on military technology. It concludes by discussing the implications of AI for warfare and the future of humanity.\n\nI have read the book and I am not impressed.\n\nFirst off, the title of the book is misleading. This isn't about the state of the art in AI or robotics. Rather, it's about the state of the art in developing autonomous weapons systems. In other words, it's about how we can develop weapons that are capable of killing people without human intervention.\n\nThis is a very important distinction because if you think about it, there are two ways to kill someone. You could shoot them with a gun, which would be a murder. Or you could use a knife, which is also a crime but less lethal than shooting. So what does the state of the art say? Well, according to the authors of the book, the state of the art says that we should develop weapons that can do both. That means that we should develop weapons that can kill people without any human involvement whatsoever.\n\nNow, I'm not going to get into all the details of the book here, but let me just give you some examples of where they make these claims. They claim that the state of the art in AI allows us to build robots that can learn to recognize faces and objects, and that these robots will eventually be able to identify humans based on facial features alone. And they claim that the state of the art in robotics allows us to create machines that can perform tasks such as driving cars, operating machinery, and even performing surgery.\n\nSo, yes, the state of the art in robotics allows us to develop robots that can operate vehicles, operate machinery, and even perform surgeries. But what about when we're talking about autonomous weapons? What about when we're talking about weapons that can kill people without any human involvement at all?\n\nWell, according to the authors of the book, the state of the art in robotics allows us to develop weapons that can kill people without any human involvement whatsoever. Now, I don't know about you, but I find this statement pretty hard to believe. After all",

    "In 1598, Captain James Hornby set sail with an eye toward capturing a large treasure hoard off the coast of Malta, Italy (also known to collectors as San Sebastián Island). There he spotted two Italian ships sailing into one another in calm waters, and gave chase, though without taking any chances because his sailors knew what they were getting into when they took the oath, which was part of the requirements of their contract with the government authorizing them in international sea law. According to a report written by Hornby's crew, three other American men joined him on shore but quickly jumped ship after realizing that they had left behind only half an iron barrel filled with small coins of varying sizes. The Italian fleet also came under attack from a German frigate led by Baron von Eberhardt-Liedermann that had been sent forth against the Americans a few months earlier because its commanding officer had died. With three hundred men aboard, the British squadron attacked first and destroyed three large merchant trading vessels leaving behind a single galleon loaded with silver; two of these smaller trading vessels had already been wrecked or boarded. Two more large vessels soon followed suit as well, and then, although some crewmen attempted to ram the enemy to avoid making themselves victims of capture, and though Hornby finally managed to corner a vessel near Naples that carried five chests of silver coinage, four cannons manned by two French marines fell upon it. At dawn, the Spanish and Dutch crews returned fire until at least a dozen English vessels arrived to take command of the battle. Finally Hornby called back the survivors who surrendered, even though many said that they had not realized that these attacks on merchant shipping had officially begun with England, since only a handful of merchants remained, including a local goldsmith named Francesco d'Antonio, to try to negotiate terms with the occupying forces. All told by 1616, twenty American traders were killed during six weeks of conflict during which much property was damaged. The American captain Edward Buckler survived on the third day of hostilities as he rode through Naples with about eighty others before the city was abandoned. To raise funds, some pirates had stolen some jewelry from a safe deposit box in a nearby house that ended up being the target after someone discovered evidence of some previous robbery having taken place there. But despite being pursued by the invaders, the American ships continued their trip back west across the Mediterranean Sea,",

    "In this story, a young woman named Sophie has been living in Paris with her boyfriend and his family. She's had an affair with one of her friends, who she met at work. When he leaves to go back home, she decides to follow him. But when they arrive at their destination, she finds that he's not there. He's gone missing! The police are called in, but Sophie doesn't want them involved. Instead, she goes to see her friend's father, who lives in the countryside. There, she meets a man who claims to be her lover. They have sex, and then Sophie realizes that she's pregnant. Her boyfriend is furious, and tells her that if she wants to keep the baby, she must marry him. Sophie refuses, and the two men leave. Sophie returns to Paris, where she discovers that her boyfriend has left town. She tries to find him, but can't. Then, she receives a letter from him, saying that he's going on vacation. Sophie thinks it might be a trap, so she follows him. On the way, she runs into another man, who says that he knows where her boyfriend is. Sophie follows him, and they end up in a hotel room. In the middle of the night, Sophie wakes up to find herself being raped by both men. She manages to escape, but the next morning, she sees that her boyfriend has disappeared. She calls the police, but they don't believe her. After some time passes, Sophie learns that her boyfriend was murdered. She begins to suspect that someone else may have killed him.\n\nI'm sure you're wondering what the point of all this is. Well, I'll tell you. It's to show how easy it is to get away with murder in France. If you kill your lover, you can simply say that you were having an affair, and no one will care. You could even claim that you didn't know about the affair until after the fact. And since you've already done something illegal (having an affair), you won't face any consequences.\n\nThis is why I think that the French government should legalize abortion. Abortion would make it much easier for women to avoid getting pregnant in the first place. Women would still need to take precautions against pregnancy, but they wouldn't have to worry as much about getting caught.\n\nAnd if you really wanted",

A group of Japanese and American diplomats has been sent to observe a civil war which is beginning in Korea and which, according to their reports, continues to cause increasing casualties until the end. Meanwhile, a news service is running an article reporting that Korea is on the verge of civil war between the north and the south. At the same time, an American senator declares that the United States has the right to intervene in Korea because the country is \"unable to defend itself against outside threats.\"\n\n(...?) However, an American newspaper in Korea is reporting that a civil war in Korea is merely a rumour, with no evidence for it. A group of Americans and Japanese who are in Korea try to discover whether the rumor is true and to prevent the fighting in Korea. Among the American visitors to South Korea is a woman who has a child with military rank, called Chon Kwon. She has recently been involved in a relationship with the leader of a group that the US claims is committing atrocities in Korea.

The photographer in this picture is actually Gen. Lee Myung-Jae.\n\n(...) And while Hideo Kimura writes down the events as the picture he has seen, the American diplomat learns from a colleague the facts of the conflict between Korea and Japan and also learns from a Japanese writer that a photo showing a small girl has been taken and a picture by Hideo Kimura can be a picture of a young girl. It was Gen. Kim Yong-Hoon who said that the picture of a tiny Korean child killed by the Japanese war machine may be a photo of the child that his group committed",
    "Green is an adult novel about a lesbian female doctor (Astrid Stawicki) that was written by the German writer Hans Christian Andersen. One of Andersen's most famous tales, the Green Child, is the setting of the plot. It was made into a 1946 film (with James Stewart cast in the lead role), and several adaptations are in production. The novel has been adapted into several television series (including one with Jennifer Aniston and Kate Winslet), and is still in production (it's actually on my own reading list).\nThe book was featured in the movie \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\", and was also translated into Japanese, English, and French. However, this isn't the first time that it has been depicted on screen. Back when I was a teenager, the movie \"The Green Child\" was featured in a commercial on \"The Disney Channel\". What made this commercial so amazing was the movie's dialogue. The entire movie was about a woman (Annette Bening as Astrid Stawicki) trying on different clothes and trying on the different jobs in the factory to find a new one that actually fits her. (I must admit that I was not a fan of that movie. I liked it a LOT more than I liked \"The Green Child\" as an adult, though I still LOVE the film!) This commercial was very controversial and the commercial soon became the center of controversy in the world of lesbian cinema (yes, we are talking about lesbian movies back in the 1970's with the release of such movie titles as \"Cinderella: The Green Girl\" and \"Love Story\"). This is probably the only time that that a lesbian movie has been so popular. It was eventually canceled too early, as production had already ended. Although later a full movie was made, that was not the Green Child commercial.\nThe plot synopsis (that was written by the author, Jörg Norkus):\n\"A woman takes a look at her life and decides if she has really done anything noteworthy in the past 30 years.

She then took up residence in his apartment building. Jack and his father eventually find themselves on the same island where they were born. Jack's father is determined to kill Jack before he can see his brother again. Jack must decide whether or not to help his father kill his own brother.\n\nI'm sure you're wondering what the point of all this is. Well, I'll tell you. It's to show how much of a hypocrite we are. We love our children so much that we would rather sacrifice them than let them know the truth. And yet, we don't want to give them the opportunity to learn the truth. Why? Because it might hurt us.\n\nWe've already discussed the fact that we don't want to teach our kids about the Holocaust because it hurts us. But there's another reason why we don't want to teach our kids about the Holocaust. It could lead to them becoming anti-Semitic.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to my daughter. Her teacher told her that Jews control everything. This caused her to become very upset. She didn't understand why people hate Jews. So she asked me if I thought Jews controlled the world. I said no.

    "The story follows Anakin Skywalker, a Human male Jedi Padawan who was trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Sith Lord Darth Vader. The main character falls in love with an alien species known as the Togruta. The story opens on a visit to a city named Tatooine that features many people dressed up like famous Star Wars characters such as a Stormtrooper holding a light saber, a Chewbacca plush toy, a Han Solo doll, etc., and has no real relation to the planet itself. Anakin discovers that he is dying when he sees Yoda, Obi-Wan's late Master, walking around with nothing but his black robes (for some reason) on with no one else in sight. He decides to go alone and encounters bounty hunters while trying to find a way to save himself. It takes almost 400 episodes before a third planet is finally found to be inhabited (in this case Naboo). This time it is much more populated than Tatooine and they are friendly towards Humans and other aliens, though there are exceptions. By this point, some of the early episodes have been published, including two later ones featuring R2D2. Some fans claim this is how you can tell if something isn't canon; even though some events occur more strongly in later sources it would seem unlikely for them not to occur at least once at some stage or another since it would take several generations (the same amount of time we have now) for new stories to build up after all other media, both visual and written are established. Many fans were disappointed to learn George Lucas had decided early in production to alter the main line of films to change them in accordance with his own vision by adding a new trilogy (Episode III), then a prequel series (Episodes IV through VI, which also served as sequels until Episode IX appeared at about 9 years after the TV series ended, although fans disagree over whether Episode VII will follow the story of A New Hope, making this a prequel saga too).",

    "Plot: In January 1969, a group of friends meets at a local movie house. During a discussion on the future of mankind, the group gets involved in a fight with an African American man named George, who pulls a knife on the younger men. When they leave the theater, the group decides to do the crime together. After finding the knife and the man's wallet, they discover more money in his room. They decide to sell the stolen items on the black market. They set out on a series of thefts, one of which involves the theft of cash and a small amount of drugs from a local dealer. The group encounters a drug dealer selling heroin, a man with a habit of leaving his valuables lying around, and a young boy with the same \"addictive\" nature as his father.\n\nThe book was authored by the late Harry Ziegler, who was also a prolific and accomplished playwright. In addition to this, Mr. Ziegler wrote more than one hundred plays and short stories, and even wrote a short-story called \"The Last of the Violets\" about the life of his father. The novel takes place inside of a small and fictional community called the \"Dangerous Area\". The title of this community was actually a satirical and satirical play on a phrase that was popular in the early 1990's referring to a small and often dangerous portion of the public: \"the dangerous area\" or \"the ghetto\".\n\nAt the climax of the story, the criminal \"Mr. Ziegler\" pulls out a gun and shoots a few people, killing one or two people. But what really causes the whole thing to spin into being a very tragic occurrence is when it is explained to the police that the suspects may also be dealing heroin at a nearby park. The local police, however, were having problems apprehending heroin dealers. Thus, the police call and inform them that they had a case, which leads to their discovery that the neighborhood actually had a large heroin black market and drug sales in it.\n\nI think this is an incredibly detailed and detailed book. The book is more than 1,000 pages long. For one, the book actually starts off when a person is doing a drug deal. The reader is given an extensive introduction on the drugs that are being used in the small amount of drugs that are actually consumed. But the part where I",
    "In this story, a young woman named Elisabeth has been kidnapped by an unknown group and taken to a remote island in the Mediterranean Sea. She is held captive there against her will until she can be sold into slavery. The kidnappers demand that she become their mistress or they will kill her. Elisabeth refuses and escapes with the help of a local fisherman who takes her back to his home on the mainland. There, he discovers that the island's inhabitants are not what they seem. They have no need for slaves and do not want them. But when Elisabeth learns that the fishermen are being hunted down by the kidnappers, she decides to take matters into her own hands. She sets out to rescue the men and women who have been enslaved on the island and bring them back to the mainland.\n\nThis sounds like a pretty standard fantasy tale, right? Well, it isn't. In fact, it is one of the most disturbing books I've ever read. It is also one of the best written.\n\nI'm going to give you a quick synopsis of the book before we get started. This is a story about a young girl named Elisabeth who is kidnapped by an unknown group and taken to a remote island in the Mediterranean Sea. She is held captive there against her will until she can be sold into slavery. The kidnappers demand that she becomes their mistress or they will kill her. Elisabeth refuses and escapes with the help of a local fisherman who takes her back to his home on the mainland. There, he discovers that the island's inhabitants are not what they seem.

She sets out to rescue the men and women who have been enslaved on the island and bring them back to the mainland.\n\nWhat makes this story so disturbing is that it is based on real events. In 2004, a group of people were abducted off the coast of Libya and brought to the island of La Vendetta. These people were forced to work as slave laborers and were subjected to horrific abuse at the hands of their captors. One man was beaten to death after refusing to join the group. Another man died after being tortured to death. A third man was killed after being thrown overboard",

    "The novel has a strong feminist political element and takes its plot from a series of short stories published in the Washington Post between 1970 and 1974. That publication was at the time under contract to the U.S. News and World Report, a now defunct news magazine. The books in that collection had a variety of themes and authors, including Alice Walker, Mary McCarthy, W.W. Norton and Joseph Conrad. A collection of stories called \"Women's Lives\" was published by the Washington Post in 1970 and 1972. Women's Lives took many of the themes of the short stories (\"The Devil's Garden\" and \"Death & Life,\" for example), including, but not limited to, \"the family's role in the world,\" \"feminism, race, and the future,\" \"the woman to whom we go for advice, advice we may not believe in,\" and \"the woman who, as a child, was made for us by God.\"\n\nThe book is described as follows by the wikipedia.org description: \"The story of the first half of Alice Walker's career is about growing up in Washington as a child of the mid-twentieth century, which is the same life Walker herself was living: in a white working class neighborhood on the outskirts of the city. The rest of the novel is about how Walker, as a young woman, made her way to the top of the American literary world, gaining worldwide acclaim, winning the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and winning a presidential Medal of Freedom.\"\n\nWhat is interesting about this, in relation to GamerGate, is how the author of the novel has been accused of engaging in racist and misogynist remarks on social media under the name of her husband. Some of you may remember this from the Zoe Quinn article above. Now, as a result of this, and because the novel was published by the Washington Post in 1970, a group of gamers has decided to petition their publisher to return the book to Wikipedia. Now, I didn't actually read the book, but I suspect that the fact that it is now being called a \"racist\" book by this community (or the fact that the characters in the book are racially stereotyped) may be part of the reason the title was changed. If this is the case, then it is very disturbing that the publisher of the book, Simon & Schuster, would do this. The petition can be found",
    "In this story, Venus is an alien planet that has been colonized by humans and their descendants. The human colonists have created a society based on science and technology, but they are still very primitive compared to other species. They live in large cities with high-rise buildings and skyscrapers, and they use computers and telephones. Their culture is dominated by the concept of \"the family,\" which includes all members of the household. This is also reflected in the names given to each member of the family. For example, the name of one character's mother is \"Mama.\" Another character's father is called \"Daddy.\" A third character's father is called \"Dadda.\" In addition, there are many references to the concept of \"love\" or \"romance.\"\n\nI'm not sure if I've ever seen anything like this before, so it was quite interesting to read about. It seems like the author had some sort of idea of what he wanted to write about, but then decided to go off on his own and create something completely different. He did mention that he wrote the book while working as a computer programmer at a company, so maybe he just got bored and started writing something else. Either way, I think it's pretty cool!",
    "Nancy Carter, played by Charlize Theron, was an American soldier known and feared for her abilities with firearms, particularly in combat. In 1944, she saved the life of Colonel Harry Lee Curtis' wife during the siege of Bastogne. A few months later she became involved in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany when General Dwight D. Eisenhower recalled her to America after the Nazis evacuated Paris before being encircled in Russia in April 1945. The book \"Last heroes\" tells the story of how Nancy came to save Curtis' family as he returns home after spending six years fighting Hitler's forces at Stalingrad where he saved thousands of lives along with hundreds more who died during that battle.(Source) While on a mission into France, Nancy (played by Jennifer Lawrence ) shoots and kills one sniper, then saves another.\n\nAt the beginning of the video clip below, you can hear the character \"Jill\" ask, \"How do we keep our name in this room?\" If it takes place inside the military bases or a hotel, just say no thanks.

    "The title character is a ten-year old girl whose parent, her older brother and an imaginary friend have been murdered by other villagers with poisoned needles during what appears at first to be a freak lightning event in their home village. After escaping and fleeing to the nearby town, she hides from her tormentors under an enormous oak tree while secretly trying to find it a new home. After several years of searching for that ideal location, The Willow Tree finds itself a place only slightly larger than the city (pop. 612) where it can live happily ever after. There are many characters who fall into this well-made world: small animals, the local dog, the farmer's children... At first I found them fascinating but later became tired reading about these silly characters and the story dragged on rather quickly. Perhaps the ending could not be more disappointing though! It has been said that as fiction writing goes it doesn't matter whether the reader loves or loathes the characters, if it makes the reader think you must have failed. My personal verdict? Very disappointed....",

    "This book was originally titled A Case of Exploding Mangoes, due to a case in April 1875, when a group of men were thrown out of an inn by their landlord who accused them of stealing mangoes while traveling on horseback on South Bank Island of Mauritius. Although local authorities quickly arrived and caught and punished those responsible, the incident had a negative effect on local tourism as it encouraged many natives that they did not want foreign intruders eating their fruit and causing a dangerous precedent that would be very embarrassing to Mauritian authorities.[10] When author William Rolfe returned to visit the island (which he also wrote a short story about called My Father's Country) he met a man who identified himself only as Mr. James Ayer. To settle matters between them, Ayer took Rolfe to his plantation on Mangrove Island at which time he set up a small hut just outside Rolfere's cabin. For the next few weeks she stayed with him while the rest of her family made long journey back to England.[11][12][13] Throughout this period, Mangrove Island became one-by-one becoming more tropical and less habitable.[14][15] Eventually, Rolfe married his fiancée and moved to nearby South Quay [Parsley Hill], where he developed another relationship with Ethel Whitaker. Both the former lovers found common ground in an intense admiration for one another. From July 1876 onward, both ladies visited and camped, staying for almost eight months.[16][17][18] It is here it seems likely (given the descriptions given above) that \"A Case of Exploding Mangoes\" takes place; however, there are several places scattered throughout this work where we get no clear or definitive clue... We know that Rolfe does a fairly good job as a novelist with such details (the entire story of My Sister's Room being but one example), yet \"A Case of Exploding Mangoes\" offers no specifics except for the aforementioned pineapple scene (and a very important one). So why do we need further details? Why don't we understand what happened prior to this particular scene in order to know what kind of scenario lies ahead? Perhaps if further events were described we'd have some idea of which character could possibly take advantage of it and whom the characters might end up dating... But I digress",

    "This complex plot was designed to make the audience think about and interpret this unusual situation, and so we can all imagine what sort of situations our protagonists may face if they were transported down below the ground surface of our earth - and up into the heavens...\n\n\nThe Underneath begins with a lengthy digression (a short story) that describes some sort of subterranean adventure for our heroes. After being released by their captors at the beginning of the book, one is captured again by his or her own allies and sent underground on a mission with them in an attempt to thwart the plans of the masterminds that are destroying the world.\n\nAt the start of Act IV, there's a large cliff overhanging part of the sky to which various characters have been bound and placed beneath. Each character has only minutes or hours, depending upon how you read it, before someone manages the feat with which he or she was previously locked out. This group, known as the 'Thingmen' (after the type of insect used as bait), includes various military officers along with spies and mercenaries who are recruited from numerous ethnicities. The plan the Thingmen devised to end a global war included an elaborate underwater operation to bring us up to the surface where an amphibious assault submarine would be fired on our main ship's surface and sink it as fast and cleanly as possible using its special weapons. While this sounds like fantasy bullshit of epic proportions I assure you these actions did take place, and will be explained throughout most of the book - and even more so when the battle actually occurs...The reason I haven't gone into too much detail here is that my readers don't want to know details and have high-intensity questions at hand, rather than having \"the answer\". By giving them details later, it makes them feel invested but doesn't provide all the answers right away..The best part though for me personally have been seeing the reaction each reader had during the chapters that gave real insight on each individual character's state of mind - it's truly fascinating - and a wonderful way to connect to your hero/heroine from the very start!As mentioned earlier this book focuses mainly on characters trapped under Earth and being subjected to brutal violence, both directly and indirectly. At times this brutality seems crueler than the humans are capable of causing to themselves and their loved ones. There are no happy endings yet, none, despite all",
    "In April 2011, US soldiers began operations to dislodge militants in Fallujah and other towns across Iraq's Anbar Province.[8] On June 1, forces made slow progress against insurgents in the Iraqi city of Ramadi (a main staging area to take on Ramadi later was abandoned). When security units began moving up into the surrounding foothill of Tala Khormato Mountain (known also as the Qayyarah ridge), Taliban fighters and their families fled before them. By late July, insurgents seized control over key points within the provincial capital of Ramadi, including two mosques, one Christian church,[9][10] and a school of government administration.[9] In addition, on October 3, 2009, Iraqi President Salah al-Abadi told reporters that coalition air strikes were causing civilian casualties in Fallujah. He added he had ordered an investigation which determined that American warplanes had used unguided bombs; Coalition forces conducted no such raid but did release video purporting to show ground troops using unguided weapons.[11][12] At some point since then the United States had to turn off the internet in parts of northern Iraq because so many civilians could not get online. Additionally, there have been widespread fears that insurgent propaganda might try to justify atrocities, both civilian and intentional, through the medium of Internet communications.\n\nA summary of this movie was posted on a number of message boards and websites, with claims ranging from it being factual, but poorly produced or edited, and perhaps done by someone interested in spreading their extremist views of Islam as a religion, to exaggerated exaggerations. After initial research, it appears that the true identity of the writer behind the screenplay was identified on November 6th, with the publication of The Truth: A Movie About Islamic Terror in Iraq posted at ABC News, written in collaboration by Sam Zook, Steve Kleinman and Michael Ratner.[13] It was intended as comedic satire, even if some viewers may find extreme depictions inappropriate and/or offensive – at least some of them. Although not mentioned in the film and not shown during previews prior to its theatrical premiere – including those advertised by Warner Bros. TV –[14], the screenplay describes a real man named Majid Khan who was killed on November 21, 2006 while fighting alongside U.S.-led coalition forces in Fallujah while filming a musicVideo called \"Cultura Lamentada\",[",
    "A high school senior gets engaged to his girlfriend, only after he discovers that she was conceived after their two years apart because her parents were in a car accident and are now divorced. She has been forced to conceal the secret of the adoption to avoid being arrested as a murderer; with her mother already facing possible incarceration. The boyfriend feels responsible when things between them soured, blaming himself rather than the baby's father. When the girl starts cheating on him, he ends up committing suicide by self-immolation over his feelings about his daughter and decides not a single thing that could possibly be the problem. He decides the best way to fix everything would be to get married first and conceive a child out of wedlock, however if it means getting hitched so soon. His friends who want to make sure they don't miss anyone at any point during their own wedding attempt to convince him, that marriage will solve all concerns, as they do not have children. However, this may lead the girl to become even more unstable than before, leading to her involvement in another act of mass violence that is also committed against innocents, this time she kills nine people by throwing a gas can lid into a window after the police caught the couple trying to dispose of evidence while speeding through highway signs, which they claim as the final straw they need to start living like a normal family, until she manages to find someone else to pick her up...the guy who has taken in a large number of orphans, who had never given up the idea of raising them (this does not seem to be a new line). There is one point where the girl tells the boyfriend that he always wanted her to join the gang, but decided once having a human right as an orphan in such circumstances, it was impossible for her to stay behind. They share a kiss as a farewell ceremony. One year later, she runs away to live without telling him or her mom but is apprehended by law enforcement officers. Her crime: stealing a bike and accidentally killing a cyclist before committing vehicular manslaughter and driving away from hospital just before she was about to be killed too. Her dad is found dead at age 21, leaving his brother a widower without much social support or a financial base. It seems that the person closest to the girls at such times of crisis are those who did nothing to prevent the events happening that led to it…her grandmother, a strict woman that",
    "On April 13, 2012, the United States government shut down Megaupload and arrested five of its employees based on illegal use of copyrighted works, such as television show reruns, movie trailers, songs and cartoons, according to U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady's order and reports from media outlets.\n\nMegaupload operated under a service agreement with file-hosting website Uploaded.net which provided uploading capacity in an effort to expand their legal user base over time.[12][13] However, the site required users to pay a monthly \"billing fee,\" making it more expensive than other download services or websites that hosted similar content (such as YouTube) which did not charge fees for uploads.[14] According to Megaupload, this arrangement saved them money by allowing them to keep profits generated from each uploaded file[15], and made up some of their total losses.[11] In 2010 the Department of Justice accused Megaupload of engaging in online copyright piracy which netted tens of millions of dollars, primarily in movie rental sales in Europe and the United States.[16] The company fought many lawsuits brought by entertainment companies after raids on their offices around New Zealand, but later withdrew its counterclaims when a federal court ruled that its service was protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution due to liability limitations imposed in contracts of service.[17] This lawsuit has since been settled out of court.[18][19]\n\nIn March 2013, former owner Kim Dotcom filed a civil suit against Hollywood studios for copyright infringement as well as racketeering conspiracy, resulting at least in part from charges being brought against him; he subsequently resigned from his position with Megaupload. It's reported that US officials are seeking the forfeiture of several million dollars worth of assets held by Dotcom in Hong Kong prior to this decision.[20]\n\nLegal troubles [ edit ]\n\nAfter taking responsibility for violating copyright law and destroying evidence which prosecutors claimed could have tied Megaupload to those acts, a motion[21] brought by the judge overseeing the case said \"Mr. DotCom must prove each element of every claim alleged to constitute a violation before this Court would consider ordering the dismissal of any individual count.\"[22]\n\nThe company was indicted within two days of the raid of its offices in Auckland New Zealand.

    "In this story, a young man named John has been diagnosed with cancer and given only two months to live. He decides to take his own life by jumping off a bridge in order to save his girlfriend's life. The girl survives but suffers severe injuries. She dies shortly after. John then goes on to become an alcoholic who lives out his days as a recluse. His friends try to help him get back into society, but he refuses to talk about what happened that day. Eventually, they decide to write a book about it. They call themselves the \"Friends of John.\"\n\nI'm not sure if I've ever read anything like this before. I don't know how much of this was written by the author or by someone else (the synopsis doesn't say), but I do know that there are some similarities between this story and the one I wrote last year. In both cases, the protagonist takes his own life because he feels hopelessly trapped in a situation where he can no longer change things. Both stories have a narrator who tries to help the protagonist find meaning in life, but neither story ends well.\n\nSo, here's my question: What would you think if I told you that I had just finished reading a novel called \"You Can't Take It With You\"?\n\nIt's a short novel, so I won't go into too many details. But suffice it to say that it follows the same basic structure as my previous story. There are three main characters: John, a depressed guy; his friend, Mike; and the narrator, who is trying to help them all cope with their problems.\n\nJohn is a very interesting character. He's a bit of a loner, but he also seems to be quite intelligent. He's got a lot going for him, but he's still stuck in a rut. He's been diagnosed with cancer, which means that he'll probably die within the next few weeks. And yet, despite everything, he's determined to keep living. He wants to make something of himself, even though he knows that he will never be able to change the world around him.\n\nMike is another interesting character. He's a pretty normal guy, except that he's a recovering alcoholic. He's also a bit of a loner, although he does seem to care deeply about John. He's also a recovering alcoholic",
    "Summary (not to scale, only a general idea) This speculative alternate history concerns a possible future in which technology developed in the 19th century by some major powers such as Germany and the United States creates a global power bloc that threatens to spread its values world-wide through a series of nuclear conflict. The USN was built upon a German template called V3. It featured an advanced form of anti-gravity, the Tractor Beam Launcher which could transport soldiers or even entire regiments to remote locations within seconds with a single beam volley, thus making the battlespace a safe zone for military exploration. The Union would soon get an experimental warhead design known as J4 that could not be stopped by any existing bomb type; this new weapon used the heat from a nuclear exchange to create a magnetic field of intense energy surrounding itself but would detonate when triggered to produce powerful electromagnetic radiation - in this case, directed into the atmosphere and ionizing atmospheric ionisation, triggering further explosions while expanding enough to engulf cities below. During World War I, many USN bases were relocated to strategic points around the globe to better defend against attack. By 1922, these installations had begun construction on a large, complex military project that would eventually give rise to Project Valhalla. A submarine was laid down for Project Valhalla, codenamed K2, from the SS Titanic (SSK), under the leadership and direction of Captain Charles Gordon's son Harold. Two years later K1 was laid out; it consisted of two submarines being fitted together into the most modern and efficient submarine layout since Edison's days and utilizing most every available power, propulsion, sensor and communication system yet invented. The SSK's mission for K1 was the exploitation of all natural resources, including oil fields, gold deposits, and petroleum in addition to the vast seas of Earth's crust. At first the initial launch attempts did poorly and they encountered extensive technological hurdles. Eventually, however, the crew successfully recovered their second sub after encountering several hostile life forms from beyond the sea known as the Voidies; they also discovered that Project Valhalla was intended by the USN to expand further than the Outer Seas with secret facilities planned deep beneath the planet itself. They succeeded in building a massive naval base at Raccoon City, which would lead them to other secret underground facilities and colonies throughout New Berlin before settling in Antarctica where they established their base called Groom Lake. This early success provided",
    "About\n\nIn May 2007, the United States District Court ruled that an American-Irish novelist had invented the character Monk, which has become widely recognizable with his distinctive red hair and beard.[1] After being convicted of plagiarism and libel by American courts, Mr. Monk sued Penguin Books for damages, accusing them of using him without his permission.[10] In addition to seeking over two million dollars in money damages, he was required to defend himself against a slander lawsuit brought by publisher John Wiley & Sons because Penguin and William Morrow failed to take reasonable care to prevent their readers and readers-at-large from thinking Monk's life story was based on someone else [7], and he sought redress also on behalf of all Americans who may be similarly harmed.[13] The book will remain locked away in court libraries at Penguin for years to come, despite never seeing its release date[14].\n\nWhat actually happened was, Monk didn't go out looking to steal another man's work; a group called the National Alliance Against Criminal and Consequential Punishment made Monk their cause and have tried to turn him into an icon. However, these stories that Monk told were not created after the fact as claimed. Rather, they are true accounts of people who saw the events described in Monk's story in the mid 1970s, and then later remembered talking about it at school or church. This isn't a case where anyone took \"Monk's\" story, wrote him a check, and said \"Here you go!\" and gave him some money to start writing his own story about such crimes occurring right before his eyes! Instead, Monk wrote this story himself out of his personal experience of what happened in 1971. Unfortunately, his personal story got repeated like a folkloric fairy tale, creating legends around his life as if he'd actually been involved in some crime that just slipped \"up\" on him.\n\nAnd, of course, nothing could be further from the truth for Monk's life, personality, and works in his career. He says he writes fiction because he can do no other with his life, but it turns out there are plenty of situations when even great authors would rather give up than write the perfect ending. So, did Monk invent the myth of Monk? Who is right—John W. Loftus, or Mark Danielewski…the author!?!?!\n\nLinks:",
    "\"In November 1979, the former Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of 300,000 to 450,000 civilians, including 300,000 children. [8][9] By early 1979, many were convinced that it was impossible to defeat the forces of the former Soviet Union and its allies. Meanwhile, in December, a meeting of the U.N. Security Council revealed the existence of Soviet nuclear weapons in Afghanistan. On January 9, 1980, a group called the United Nations International Security Assistance Force (UNISAF) – led primarily by the United States, Britain, and Pakistan – began attacking the Taliban. In January and February, UNISAF troops conducted a successful assault on the Taliban for two weeks.[25][26]\n\nOn March 13, 1980, following a three month aerial mission by the U.S. Air Force and U.N. troops, and a three month ground mission by U.N. troops, the Taliban suffered a major series of defeats while the Soviet Union sent more troops to Afghanistan.[27] However, by the end of the Soviet operation in mid-February, most of the Soviet dead had been replaced by dead and wounded Americans and British.[28] According to an Afghan intelligence report, on February 9, 1981, when the Soviet forces finally withdrew from Afghanistan, the Taliban had already lost about 600 men, most of whom were in the mountains.[29]\n\nThe United States in 1980 was in the process of withdrawing military forces from the rest of the world, except for a few permanent installations. The United States was planning to use the Afghanistan conflict to reverse this trend.[30] The Taliban's initial defeats at the hands of the foreign counterattack on December 28, 1979, appeared to leave the Taliban in control of Afghanistan,[31] and it was hoped by the United States that this would have a positive effect on U.S. influence in the region.[32] This is unlikely to have been the case. On its approach to Khwarazm in January 1980, the Soviet forces had already had three weeks of extensive fighting, not to mention a number of other defeats during this period.[33] The United States, in spite of the loss of an estimated 600 American dead and 10,000 wounded, still attempted to use the Afghan war to reverse the Soviet military advantage. In April, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said that if the Soviets continue",

    "The synopsis states that it is inspired by the film The Departed. The text reads:I will give this another shot and see what I get from it:So I get a few short paragraphs of information and a scene from the movie starring the title character. I feel like this would be a good time to read this short story once again and see if the plot points are still still valid or if it has taken on a completely different flavor.This is from an online version of \"Noon Wine\" that people have sent down (at least the one I downloaded: http://www.wordreference.com/view/4/2/9/ )The author states that he wanted the text in this short story to be a good read and enjoyable to read so I'm guessing that the ending was a bit less satisfying to him than what he received from his short story published online.

    "In this tale by David Foster Wallace, a troubled 18-year-old named Sean Maguire falls in love with Carla Gallo when his father dies. Carla is working at her father's bar when Sean, having learned her secret, convinces his father to fire her. Sean lives with his best friend, Jim Jones. In addition to these characters, the novel also has two minor characters, a man named Frank and a woman known as \"Mr. Jones.\" They all live in a run-down apartment and are not part of the overall story. The main plot revolves around Sean and Carla.\n\nIt is an urban fantasy and the entire book is written under the guise of a fictional young adult novel. The entire thing is a complete disaster. The main characters are written in a way that can not be understood by the audience and only make the reader question everything he is just told. It is obvious that this book was written in a rush and it only really goes nowhere. Here are some of the major problems with the book:\n\n1- The story doesn't make sense. If this had been written as a book, people wouldn't have been able to imagine what the story was about – but not like this! The characters are written in a confusing manner and they aren't logical, which makes them completely hard to empathize with.\n\n2- The entire book is littered with spelling errors. All of the characters and their names are spelled in different ways (some can't spell). It is a nightmare to read and you are left reading in frustration or disgust (depending on how much you like typos). You are never told which characters are supposed to be real but it is obvious that a lot of the ones in the book are fictional.\n\n3- The main character is absolutely pointless. He doesn't make any sense. You know that you will love him one day, but you never do and he doesn't do anything. There is nothing he does that interests you and everything just goes by.\n\n4- All the characters use the same word for sex and love. \"Dildo.\" \"Cocksucker.\" It is like someone used a typewriter with a paper clip to write this book for it to be as horrible as it is.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well it means that this book doesn't even belong in",

He follows it through the trees until he finds himself face-to-face with the bear again. This time, however, the bear does not attack him. Instead, it turns around and walks away.

Afterward, Dave takes off running back to town. As he runs, he sees a man walking down the road. Dave stops and asks if he knows where the bear went. The man replies that he doesn't know either. Dave tells him about how he killed the bear and how he escaped. The man says that he will help Dave find the bear. Dave thanks him and continues on his way.\n\nI'm sure you're wondering what the point of all this is. Well, I'll tell you. It's to show that there are many ways to write a book. Some people like to use the same basic structure every single time they write a book. Others have different ideas about how to structure a book. And some authors just don't care about any of those things. In fact, most writers don't even bother trying to figure out what kind of book they want to make. They just start writing whatever comes to mind. But I think that's why we love books so much. We enjoy reading something new each time we read it. So, I hope you enjoyed my little experiment.

    "Asterix and the Great Crossing\n\nPossible reference to Asterix and the Great Battle(also called the Great Battle of the Bulls)\n\nThe Great Battle of the Bulls has become well known since the time of Asterix, a Roman author. It is a well-known story from ancient history to this day in ancient history, in the west. The Battle takes place during the reign of the king Caligula, who is trying to conquer Gaul and Gaulians. Caligula is trying to conquer Gaul with a force of 5,000 horsemen. Some Gauls have been defeated, but others who have not been defeated have resisted and defended themselves and their homes.\n\nIn this situation, a Gaul leads his companions into a cave, and waits as night falls to attack Caligula and his force of 5,000 horsemen. When the Gaul finds himself no chance of winning, he asks his companions that if they cannot win the battle, then defeat him, and put an end to his tyranny. After the Gaul and his companions have exhausted their weapons of war, they find the cave empty, and hear a noise coming from the cave. The Gaul and his companions open the door to find a person, and they think the person to be a Gaulish noble. They try to talk with the Gaul but find him to be mad and insane, therefore they throw him in a pit and bury him. After the Gaul has been buried, he is reborn and tries to kill Caligula again.\n\nAfter Caligula has been defeated again (by Asterix), the Gaul appears in front of the people who believe he is a conqueror on behalf of Rome. Asterix confronts him and demands his answer. He says that he is a Roman and asks Asterix if he had any idea of the great power he holds in his hands. Asterix says that he is not the master of his destiny but that he is just an ambassador sent by Asterix to show what the world should not fall into. Asterix asks what name Rome should be known by, and the Gaul says that Rome should be known as Aries. He then gives a speech to the people of Rome and tells them that the reason of their downfall is because they do not live up to tradition and thus their destiny was not to conquer the empire but to live in peace and friendship with other peoples",
    "\"...it was found on page 978 in John C. Wright's The First Book of Samuel by the same author...\"  This excerpt contains the most revealing piece of information we've had about Dr. Richard Adams, as told to me privately by his close friend Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron and subsequently confirmed with multiple other sources....According...to my recollection, during a discussion I recently had with a trusted insider within Cambridge S.U. that some very disturbing secrets were being tried out here at F.I.S., an experimental mind control research facility run by DARPA. According to this source, the purpose of these tests was one thing -- to determine if the technologies being developed could be used against the American population. These weapons were not meant just be reserved for foreign use but intended for domestic usage, possibly even deployed in our own country.\nAfter obtaining documents from F.I.S.'s files, researchers discovered many startling secrets surrounding its activities including the following; All the while it seems like Adams may also have been involved. For instance, there is correspondence between him and another top agent from the government (not from MIT), Dr. Robert G. Johnson who worked under Adams during WWII at the Fort Detrick Biological Warfare Center. He reported directly back to Dr. Paul Tibbets, the Head Mind Control Research Unit at CIA headquarters in Langley Virginia.\nFrom April of 1947 until 1948 Johnson was assigned by James Jesus Angleton to work with Edward Teller's MIND Research Project, which later became known as MKULTRA (the initials stand for: Medical Research Projects Intended solely for Therapeutic or Prophylactic Effects). As a result, he received a top secret clearance in 1945 on his first assignment. During his time there, he also took charge of investigating how human brains work such as decoding memory traces and controlling behavior according to the principle of neural entrainment - where thought patterns are established through repetitive activity that stimulates connections on brain areas responsible for those responses and creates the desired state of feeling and thinking. This technology was eventually tested on prisoners at Abu Ghraib and on POW/MIA's subjected to torture experiments (among them Francis Dossa) and became a major focus of study in behavioral science in the 1950s and 60s and continued well into the 1970s before being officially abandoned by researchers due to ethical concerns over using prisoners for testing purposes and",

    "On Christmas Day, 2012 my girlfriend's brother brought home a book called The Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About, which featured an excerpt from Chapter One entitled \"How Not to Tell A F***ing Lie.\" The author of the excerpt, Nick Leowyce, was openly bisexual. He wrote that chapter with the intent of promoting awareness about sexual orientation in teens; however, according to him, this turned into an essay on sex between adult men and children. I read the first few chapters immediately after arriving at college (UCLA), but was quickly put off by the very harsh content. I knew it was wrong, something I had heard before but couldn't grasp how, or why…until one night when my roommate came over from school complaining about me having sex with other boys on campus. It wasn't rape, he told me—I would have never done anything like that—but I also didn't know why this didn't seem ok until that point. At some point during last year I discovered the Internet, which I can recall doing so at least two or three times per week. In the past, there were lots of resources like NSPCC's [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children] Kids are Everywhere or the Trevor Project [for LGBT youth]. However, these services are largely limited within Western society, and they tend to focus less specifically on certain demographics—such as gay/lesbian youths—and more broadly on raising awareness among parents around what \"normal\" sexual behavior looks like for our children. Through Google, YouTube and various other sites, I stumbled on other videos featuring frank discussions of heterosexuality. They tended not be explicit, nor provocative in nature, but instead focused on questions such as: What do you think about masturbation? When are people probably most likely to become sexually aroused? What does it mean if someone says his bedroom isn't 100 percent clean? What goes into choosing your gender anyway? How long should heterosexual relationships survive? And finally, how do kids get involved with each other once they're growing up and starting to develop romantic feelings toward other people? These kinds of questions seemed important enough for adults—at the time, my girlfriend and I both had full-time jobs (so I'm pretty sure she found them interesting!)—to ask their significant others and friends, which led us to discover that our own",

    "CAB InBev has bought out US brewer SABMiller with a final bid of just over £17bn (£14.4bn). While there will be some disruption in SAB's global operations, they are not expected to impact existing markets or the near future growth of their core brands. The deal gives more breathing space for AB InBev into new business areas including its craft beer segment and allows it to build up the capacity needed across its portfolio. SABMiller sales fell 4 per cent following the takeover announcement but that was the result of a fall in volumes. They have also been hit by weak margins, which SAB blamed on soft demand for lager and mid-strength beers. SAB chief executive Martin Winterkorn said after the close of the merger there would be no change to the company's capital expenditure plans or plans for major investments. He maintained his forecast for higher earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) between 2017-18 and 2020-21 compared with this time last year. But analysts had warned previously about whether global market prices could recover after record-low levels in recent years as global brewing consumption remains high at around 1 billion barrels annual.\n\n\nIn case you're wondering, the headline and subheaders above were both attributed to \"NBC 10\". NBC-TV, CBS-TV and Telemundo owned and produced each network so all three are getting credit/blame. And I did find one instance of my own where the CNN reporting on the news story included an item citing The Wall Street Journal. That may explain why everyone is confused now.",
    "A discussion among Muslim voters in America's battleground states about what they consider to be important issues has been dubbed by one woman as an 'anonymous' call to action for Muslims, but its origins may go back much further than elections.\n\nIn her role as director of campaigns and communications at US-based Islamic Relief USA, Alia Salem has organised regular conferences with US-Muslim community organisations across the United States. They focus on the many factors that influence voting intentions but in particular include how people approach the issue of an Islamic theocracy. In this week's conference in Washington DC, Ms Salem told attendees including BBC Arabic that 'there's no secret' about this question.\n\nMs Salem said there have always been questions that are very personal and deeply rooted inside every single American or Muslim when it came to Sharia law. But her view is that as Americans were now dealing directly and directly with these things through Donald Trump, the current conversation might be getting clearer about what was on everyone's minds.\n\nMs Salem says some people fear Islamic rule because their communities are being disrupted by Sharia law, while others believe we can choose not to follow Sharia law because our government doesn't allow us to do so. A recent study by US think tank Pew Research Center revealed that a record number, 39%, say that 'there needs to be stricter enforcement of federal laws against non-violent crimes such as drug possession' as opposed to 47% who are supportive.\n\nWhile these numbers are hardly shocking, the way that they've shifted could speak volumes about US attitudes towards religious freedom, according to Professor Richard Silverstein, vice president and director of public relations at Islam Institute of North America (IINA) and a distinguished visiting fellow at Brookings Institution think tank.\n\nSpeaking with bbc.com after the conference, Prof Silverstein said he believed that for Muslim voters especially, Trump's campaign promises to ban all Muslims entering the country could very well change the face of America itself.\n\n'This guy isn't from New York, Pennsylvania; there aren't that many Muslim Republicans,' he said. 'He's got people of Somali background, people of Muslim background... It would shift the demographics.'\n\nProf Silverstein added of one comment made at the conference: 'We found out today after the event last night that many of them were saying not only are you going to ban entry into the country, whether we'll all",

    "\"It is with a heavy heart that I announce my retirement from Davis Cup in 2014,\" said British Davis Cup captain, Paul Henman. \"I want to thank Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and all of my fellow players with whom I have played a part in the past 18 years. In many ways it has been a joy, and it was a great honour to captain some of the greatest players of all time. This season the Davis Cup has been special as we began playing in Canada and it's been a great experience to see so many young players play for their country. We had good performances from players born from 1994 in the quarter-finals, making it an entertaining night that is hard to beat.\"\n\n\nOn the eve of our first match in Toronto, and with three of the biggest names of the Davis Cup tournament in action, I wanted to take the opportunity to address some questions regarding my plans for the following year. The year 2013 is always fraught with many possibilities for me as a Davis Cup captain. Some of our younger players will be pushing for their first major title this year and at this point the Davis Cup is at a critical juncture of its evolution.\n\n\nThroughout the season I have had countless conversations with ATP Chairmen about the direction of the Davis Cup, with a focus on the players as individuals; as individuals not as individuals of a team at any one point of the tournament; and in particular looking to the role of young players in the longer term; the role of Davis Cup as a stepping stone to the next level in Davis Cup.\n\n\nI believe the greatest opportunity for Davis Cup's survival lies in the hands of young captains who have the same passion for the game as I have, and will develop a sustainable vision for the Davis Cup to be more relevant and interesting to spectators and players.\n\n\nOn behalf of my staff, all the players, my federation, and the Davis Cup Association I thank you for your support and look forward to seeing you all across the globe next year.\"\n\n\nAfter a few days of reflection on the season, I decided that an easy and refreshing change of environment was probably the best way back to the tennis court. I want to thank Roger Federer for taking the opportunity to speak with me on this topic last week and for his unwavering support as I decided this is the right thing to do. This decision will not",
    "Tory MP Nadine Dorries, right, has demanded plans for Conservative housing projects across the South East are abandoned in the light of reports the local council had been told to cut costs.\n\nAt Wednesday night's local government meeting Labour candidate Jane Copeland said proposals from an east Wales council proposed cuts 'will have profound impacts across the south'.\n\n\n'I am aware that people who live near these developments will feel the effects not just here but around the country,' Copeland added.' If this plan goes ahead it will be disastrous for our communities and the wider economy as well as hurting local families and businesses.' Council leader Ian Morgan denied allegations that his office was told to delay approving proposals at East Wall Cymru. He rejected any suggestion of party political bias or political tactics.\n\nIt is understood no decision on the development proposals can be taken until after the European elections next year - so much is yet to happen which would influence opinion on matters on whether they should proceed.\n\nBut it emerged last week Councillor Neil Davis had contacted Welsh Government ministers asking them to investigate the implications of the planning regulations as part of scrutiny work. The issue is likely to dominate political debate over future UK policies under new parties which are expected to hold overall majority after May's election. Mr Anderson said he was unaware of plans to cut down on development at the time of his nomination, despite knowing both the Conservative Party and National Assembly for Wales were looking at reducing planning rules for houses across the public sector.",
    "US show sued for rat-eating stunt After a US television production sparked a backlash against animal cruelty online, a Missouri court has ruled the show should be punished for misleading viewers. This month, more than two weeks after the documentary \"Rat Farm\" aired on National Geographic, a Missouri judge convicted \"Rat Farm\" director Stephanie Soechtig on three counts of misdemeanour copyright infringement and ordered her to pay penalties and attorney fees. \"Rat Farm\" is a documentary about a research project that involves the training and use of laboratory rats to perform tasks previously done only by humans. Though the US film industry is already wary of animal rights concerns and animal research, the documentary portrays that research – which animal rights activists say exposes the cruelty of the animal industry – as the latest way to make money. After the documentary aired, animal rights groups launched a social media campaign to have it banned on national TV, threatening to pull the plug on the show. Many, including animal rights group PETA, were outraged by the rat stunt that was shown in the film.\n\nSo, I can understand if a person were to ask who is going to take care of the rats if some sick animals decide to break out of their cages? And who will care if some rats or mice do decide to escape the cages or get into the food/water mix? It would be in the best interest of the rat, that's who!\n\nSo, this is nothing to get excited about. The US government has already passed many laws to protect the domestic pet (and the domestic animal), so the US should not be sued too.\n\n(Visited 12 times, 1 visits today)",

    "A German city was aflame today as two women who appeared to be from the same family stabbed and seriously injured several people – including two men – in a restaurant in the city. The attack took place at about 2pm local time (11pm UK time) in the Rhein-Neckar-Straße (RNL) in the western German city of Wuerzburg and left one of the two women dead and two hospitalised. German state broadcaster ARD, quoting local police, said one of the victim's is a woman. A spokesperson for St Gallen police told Bild that the woman, who has not been identified, was killed by police. Police said she tried to kill herself. The victims included several staff and customers of the RNL and were believed to be in their fifties and sixties. Both women are understood to be in their 20s, police said. \"A fight had broken out in the restaurant\", a spokesperson for the local police said. \"The men of the restaurant tried to separate the women. As the situation became violent, the women broke out and attacked people\". \"A fight broke out in the restaurant,\" said a police spokesman for the St Gallen city office. \"The men of the restaurant tried to separate the women.

I'm going to prove I'm a top top level player.' With his first goal of the season, a superb lob over Petr Cech in front of the back four, he may need to become an even better finisher if it is to avoid a fall from grace at Chelsea.\"\n\nWe felt it best that this article be published on the day the following news came to light about the Chelsea star.\n\nIn an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, Fernando Torres was asked about the possibility of a reunion with former club Liverpool in the near future.\n\nWith an end to his contract at Anfield imminent, \"there is still a possibility\" that he could rejoin the Merseyside club \"if they want him,\" said Torres. But Torres went on to say that such a move would only happen in the unlikely event that Brendan Rodgers is still in charge of Liverpool at that time.\n\nWhile that news was not directly related to the situation at Chelsea, it will come as no surprise to Chelsea fans if the Blues boss does come back into the game this winter.\n\nWhile a return to Liverpool would be the most logical choice for the Spaniard this winter, the fact that one of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas wants a move to the Etihad has thrown the door open slightly to Jose Mourinho's Chelsea.\n\nAs far as reports surrounding the Blues are concerned, we are expecting the club to announce a contract extension for the Spaniard soon. A source at the club has informed us that Torres has now set his heart on a new 5 year contract at Chelsea.\n\nThe source also said that \"He (Torres) is pleased with the club's new direction and wants to stay for at least three seasons.\"\n\nWe can also expect the Premier League leaders to continue to pay the 24 year old out of their own pocket this season as they did with his previous four previous seasons. We would also expect Torres to sign a new contract by pre-season if/when the season starts in earnest.\n\nChelsea will undoubtedly do whatever it takes to keep top strikers Costa and Fabregas in the squad.

    "A new law in Jamaica will make it illegal for anyone to use reggae music as an excuse to discriminate against someone else, including using it to justify hate crimes and violence. The legislation was passed by parliament last week after being backed by the Jamaican government and the country's largest gay rights group, the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGHRC). It also includes provisions that allow people to sue those who use homophobic lyrics or songs. The bill has been criticised by some religious groups, but supporters say it is necessary to protect the rights of gays and lesbians. The law comes just months after the death of a young man at the hands of his father over what he believed were homophobic remarks made on a radio show.\n\nThis is not the first time that Jamaica has tried to outlaw reggae music. In 2009, the Jamaican government attempted to pass a similar law which would have criminalised the use of reggae music in public places. However, this attempt failed when the Jamaican Supreme Court ruled that the law violated freedom of expression.",

    "BEREA, Ohio -- Browns coach Pat Shurmur on Wednesday again suggested that he was unaware that defensive end Ray McDonald spent most of his time in jail two years ago for assaulting then-girlfriend and now ex-fiancée Evanger Taylor. But another player made no such suggestion, telling cleveland.com that he didn't know if McDonald had been convicted or acquitted, saying it would be an interesting case because of the circumstances leading to its acquittal. A former NFL player who said he wasn't ready to comment publicly about the matter last week, linebacker Karlos Dansby acknowledged McDonald spent some amount of time getting help but also expressed concern about potential repercussions down the road as well. Both players have called attention elsewhere in the media to their ongoing disputes with certain teammates and those around them.... McDonald ended up being given probation but not jail time by County Court Judge James Pohl. That sentence began to expire several months after the charges were filed when local authorities found they hadn't provided the probation officer his correct number, according to court clerk Karen Clark. The woman in this situation is likely much more sympathetic than Shurmur might think -- she's probably one of the few people who actually understands the effects of domestic violence better than him. While there is no legal procedure that prevents an employer from asking whether someone has violated a specific condition or whether something that happened within the last 10 years should count toward a conviction, anyone who has been threatened or abused doesn't deserve any benefits at all, let alone sympathy from any company that takes advantage of their good nature. So let me say exactly what I want Shurmur's listeners to hear... In May of 2013, McDonald punched, choked and kicked Eviction Taylor so badly she suffered three broken ribs. This led her to sue McDonald, Taylor and others involved for assault, battery, infliction of emotional anguish, intentional infliction of emotional distress and stalking. In her lawsuit (which was settled out of court), Taylor alleged she repeatedly tried to get out of McDonald's apartment when the latter wouldn't allow it, which got increasingly uncomfortable with McDonald's behavior. Her suit charged that McDonald broke both her hands trying to hold onto his arm, threw beer bottles at her face or into the sink when she attempted to leave the apartment and attacked and choked her during a confrontation after he refused to pay for their child care the day her mother discovered he'd cheated on her",

They've been made with the benefit of hindsight.\" Mr Guterres said: \"Our responsibility as officials is to take these matters very seriously.\"\n\nSo much for the claim that Turkey was not a safe country to enter the EU.\n\nAs for Turkey, the head of Turkey's border police told CNN on Thursday the group of Syrians entered illegally, and that they had refused to show ID papers.\n\nCNN cited Gen. Akif Cetin as saying the men \"tried to hide\" their identities.\n\nHe said they \"knew they would be detained\" if they didn't show their papers.\n\nSo, this is how \"safe\" a country is—if it's an \"underground railroad\" as President Obama once characterized Syria and other Third World nations.\n\nI guess you could say that's one example of where we are \"doing what it takes\" to stop people from fleeing, despite the fact that most of the world thinks they should be safe from Western and Gulf-sponsored refugee policies.\n\nBut that's how politicians see it anyway—and they can be trusted to lie about the facts any time they please.\n\nIn fact, the very same BBC journalist who called his article as \"the most alarming news report I can think of,\" has been accused in the past of fabricating stories:\n\nA former BBC journalist who made a string of shocking claims last week has admitted he falsified details of a military operation against a Syrian rebel group.

    "The former Labour leader, who has been knighted in the New Year Honours, attended to give evidence before the Commons Public Bill committee as it considers changes to the state honours system for members of Parliament. Earlier this year Baron Kinnock was criticised after declaring that a vote against Britain's entry into the European Union would be tantamount to having taken the country out of Europe – while he voted against it. During his appearance today Kinnock said the suggestion was'very insulting', adding: \"It is a form of anti-democratic behaviour which should not now be tolerated or condoned.\"... Mr Hague, who has become an EU commissioner, chaired the Public Bill Committee when it examined proposals made by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown for some peers and other public appointments to have a direct involvement with decisions about membership of the bloc through referenda or elections instead of all these lengthy stages of approval at the top end through the Houses.\"\n\nThere were also reports yesterday that Lord Mandelson will resign his post as Business Secretary if Labour can win the next General Election.\n\n\nAs I've written previously and shown in detail here, if Tony Blair had done something similar during the Iraq War it'd now look pretty stupid. As it stands it looks like George W Bush deliberately misled people about the threat Saddam posed to US national security - specifically by getting us involved so we wouldn't needlessly send our troops to fight and die there in order to justify intervention. In any case no matter whether you're personally pro-war (like most Democrats), or indifferent along a spectrum between opposing the war (most moderate voters) and being completely opposed (as most Republicans), everyone agrees we don't want another 9/11-style attack ever again. So why wouldn't America try to use those lessons learned to protect itself and its allies? It seems we don't have sufficient time - or courage apparently - to decide whether we might really rather just sit on Iraq until somebody invents a safer way of destroying stuff than drones.

    "Apple has sued a French website for revealing its upcoming iPhone, as the iPhone-maker continues the legal crusade it launched against The Macisture website. The complaint was filed before the site was taken off the Net by the French courts. The news site, which had been the source of much of Apple's information about its upcoming products before last week's reveal, is back on the Net, but Apple lawyers have sent the domain to Apple's US attorneys for possible seizure. \"I have taken steps to block future attempts at the site,\" said Jacques-Hervé Faucher, France's anti-piracy chief. \"I do not want this site to be a source in the future for the dissemination of information about Apple and its iPhones.\" The plaintiff in the Macisture case is the Dutch company Cazaux Systems, which owns www.materism-software.com, the site that published the leaked photographs of the iPhone-maker's phone.\n\nWhen Apple started this crusade, there was no such thing as a 'leaked' picture. When you have a photograph, you either have the camera rolling (when it's taking a picture) or you don't. You never 'leak' picture. If you take a picture with your camera, you have just taken it, while if you take a picture through the camera of a smart phone, this has just happened, and no picture has just been taken. You know what a phone screen looks like, and the screen goes on all the time. The 'leaked' smartphone picture just happens, since you aren't holding the phone with you.\n\nIn any case, when I started this blog, it was to find out what some of the photos that had been leaked to it, were actually. I have done this, and in the article I describe how people with cameras, on various social media sites, have been taking pictures of those images and adding names to them (which is usually not done). Sometimes the person taking a picture adds a name, which is pretty clear, but I am still unsure exactly what each phone and image looks like.\n\nThis is what Apple wants, to control who has the pictures of its products that have been leaked.\n\nThis is what Apple also wants to take control of, the names of the photos that have been leaking out:\n\nHere are some photos from the French",
    "British scientist Julian Savulescu has revealed his invention in London could pave the way for an herbal wonder called Cannabis that would make it easier to control epileptic seizures in children and adults as well as reducing the side effects of prescription drugs such as opiates. It comes after scientists at the University College London (UCL) reported successfully using cannabis oils with one million THC levels – comparable to those found in marijuana – for treating symptoms such as pain, spasticity, nausea and vomiting. More than 35,000 people are thought to be taking medicine containing cannabinoids every year which may not contain any form of tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabis; however, up to 100% may come as a result of errors in testing. These include: having cannabis samples tested on labs used to test pharmaceutical formulations, whether they have been produced by a British company\n\nsamples being sent to overseas laboratories without clear labelling, and whether they were even \"authentic\" British strains Of particular concern are preparations from overseas suppliers that haven't had the chance to get their US equivalent up and running before launching. Despite this, NHS website prescribing information indicates that more than two dozen US companies now supply oil derivatives that do carry high potency or high levels of THC. Mr Savulescu's team has developed what he believes to be the first plant extract suitable for use on patients suffering epilepsy. The results show that cannabis contains a non-psychoactive chemical called cannabidiol (CBD), also known informally as CBD because it does have some psychotropic capacity (see below). When the researchers give mice CBD via liquid injections, they're able to mitigate, halt or delay seizures caused by brain tumours such as glioma; otherwise it damages neurons in the areas controlled by these proteins. The research is published in the journal Neuropharmacology, and is currently recruiting clinical trial patients. Cannabidiol was discovered by Italian researcher Angelica Elettri who worked under Professor Martin Gruber. His team later isolated other components: Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, which has anti-inflammatory powers (although its therapeutic effect is limited); cannabigerol, which shows promise in relieving inflammation associated with cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; and tetrahasomic acid, which may reduce anxiety in sufferers.

    "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36937154\n\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The British government is holding the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in contempt of court for the \"dodgy affair\" over his role in the Iraq War, a federal judge ruled. Blair is fighting extradition to America, where he could face charges ranging from war crimes to perjury while he was in office. He's accused of lying about the circumstances surrounding the decision to use military force in Iraq, and on Thursday the judge in the case upheld the decision. The ruling is final and can be appealed to the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \"It is a travesty that Tony Blair -- who has led the United Kingdom for the better part of a dozen years -- is being held at our borders against the will of the people of the United Kingdom,\" said his lawyer, Matthew Jury. \"The British people rightfully consider this an outrage and an affront to their intelligence.\" After the U.S. invasion of Iraq on March 19, 2003, at least 179 people were killed and more than 4,000 were wounded, according to the U.K. Ministry for Veterans Affairs.",
    "It was another grim record month for trade in the US, as imports and exports saw the US trade deficit soar to nearly half a trillion dollars for the month of March (a total of $500 billion in 2004). Imports slipped by $40 billion from $475 billion last month to $457 billion last month to reach their lowest on record. This comes after the March trade deficit had peaked at $630 billion at the start of the year. The biggest loser was the car sector, which suffered the biggest decline since September 1991 when prices collapsed following the start of the oil crisis. The car sales slump - down by 32.5% from the start of 1992 - also caused production to decline by 27% from its April baseline, according to the National Auto Dealers Association. Imports also dropped by a greater share of what American consumers were buying, with goods purchased by car-loving Americans decreasing from 54.8% of total sales to 52.7% in March, according to the trade publication Auto Sales Information Services. This comes after some of the worst years of the recession saw car sales fall by 50% from December 1989 to November 1990. On the export side, exports of non-oil products are also declining by 5.3% from the corresponding month last year. The decline in exports is attributed to weakness in emerging economies like Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, while the US exported just 2.9% of the products it bought - down 18.8% from last year's levels. The US exported an estimated $3.2 billion worth of autos, $1.6 billion worth of machinery and 4.3 billion pints of beer in March. In terms of food, exports were down slightly at $2.7 billion, with beef, pork and poultry slipping out of the top 15 groups of goods that the US imported. \"The bottom line: the US trade deficit is shrinking by about $100 billion annually, and there's a substantial risk this trend could continue,\" says Jim Dettmer of the Congressional Budget Office.",

    "Pinochet'sentenced to eight years' in prison over 1982 invasion\n\nSeptember 15, 1998\n\nAfter 16 years and nine months ago he was sentenced by judge Carlos Marcello Carroño of the Appeals Court to eight years in prison for overseeing killings during an Argentine offensive against Islamist rebels who took over Santiago airport in September 1982.\n\nBut judges at a previous Court of Institutional Matters decided to re-open the case against him because there was no evidence he was behind any acts of torture or violence that amounted, according to judicial regulations, to crimes against humanity.\n\nSo Pinochet's trial in 1990 was dropped – and it remains so today. The court has now set up another trial without him but this time it will examine whether torture committed before 1975 when President Alfredo Stroessner granted full parliamentary immunity to former leaders as well as politicians, military generals and businessmen should merit reprieve under international treaties outlawing torture or cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (ITTDP). This year the judges ruled again not to reopen proceedings against the former head of state after discovering that some witnesses were dead. Judge Carroño said last night that two others had gone missing and they would have to be found as soon as possible.\n\nHe added though only one juror appeared yesterday morning. He was a lawyer of the victim himself. Another appeared late on Saturday to say she couldn't bring herself to testify. The prosecutor argued on Friday evening there are \"no reasons\" why two jurors shouldn't be allowed to join their colleagues due to the nature of their work. Both gave detailed accounts and testimonies about some of the atrocities committed during the rebellion and the coup, which also killed between 3,000 officers and around 20,000 rebels. They were all taken to military courts for prosecution. Several years ago it was discovered that several jurors were involved with anti-Castro groups and many were either members of fascist militias or participated at illegal street rallies glorifying the struggle against Castroism that came to be known as \"La Pegadora\". According to press reports today one juror reportedly admitted having been a member of both of these organizations and stated she voted against the defendant based on his right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution. She said the evidence against him was circumstantial rather than decisive and didn't show if he ordered executions.",

    "England have been handed a tough Sevens draw in Dubai after losing to New Zealand last weekend, but coach Stuart Lancaster says he's not worried about his side's chances against Australia and Fiji. England will face Australia at Twickenham on Saturday before facing Fiji at Twickenham on Sunday. The team then travel to Hong Kong for their final pool match against Japan on Tuesday. \"We've got a very good chance of beating both those teams,\" said Lancaster. \"I think we're going to be able to do that.\"\n\nThis is an interesting statement by Lancaster as it seems like he doesn't want to take any risks with his players' health. He also mentions that they'll play two games in three days which could mean fatigue or injury problems. I'm sure there are plenty of other factors involved here, but this is one of the more concerning aspects of the tournament so far.\n\nLancaster has already stated that he wants to see some changes made to the squad for the World Cup, including bringing in some younger players. This is something that would help the team develop faster and give them a better chance of winning the tournament. However, if he can't get these changes through then he should probably just call it quits.",

    "The MS drug is so effective at extending the lives of patients with certain types of MS, that it is set to become an annual \"approved\" therapy for about 300,000 people.\n\nA drug treatment developed by Roche, the Swiss company that makes Sativex, is set to be approved by the American Medicines Association in July.\n\nThe drug, a combination of the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline and the anti-spasmodic drug inhaled vapourised THC, could become official prescribing medicine for children and many adults.\n\nIf approved, Sativex could become the first prescription treatment for MS, says Dr Andrew L. Grosvenor, professor of pharmacology at University College London and chief medical officer at MS Society.\n\n\"Sativex is approved now by regulators in several other countries, so one day it could eventually become official prescribing medicine in many countries.\"\n\nAccording to some estimates, a third of people with MS have a positive response to Sativex, which is less than the 80% of people taking another drug, interferon beta, for the disease.\n\nThere are two main forms of MS, MS-1 and MS-2, the former affecting about 100,000 people annually and the latter about 5,000 people.\n\nScientists believe the drug may slow the rate of the body's inflammation, which may improve the signs and symptoms of the disease and reduce the need for long-term steroid therapies which can cause bone and joint damage.\n\nSativex has two main components – either a drug known as an anabasine or cannabidiol – which are derived from the cannabis plant, and THC, a main psychoactive component of the cannabis plant.\n\n\"The drug, which is not currently licensed in this country, will become official next year,\" the MS Society said in a blog.\n\n\"The MS Society and other leading doctors' groups will soon be gathering in New York to discuss what steps can be taken to ensure the medicines available over the next two or three years become the most effective treatment for people with this devastating disease.\"",

    "Japan's finance minister Yoshihiro Mori said on Friday the government intended to continue as if inflation was stable or falling, despite the Bank of Japan cutting interest rates and saying it would start buying the nation's bonds at an unannounced pace starting in March through next July. The BOJ raised its benchmark overnight rate by half point earlier in the week and cut the amount of cash it pours into banks - known as quantitative easing - four times in eight months. \"From now until mid-April, we will do everything as if inflation could change any moment,\" Mr Mori told reporters in Tokyo. He denied reports that his words had been misinterpreted in relation to a potential shift of monetary policy. Inflation remained below 2 per cent for most of 2010, despite falling food prices, which have spurred consumer spending, as well as record tax receipts that drove the budget surplus to 1tn yen ($11bn), nearly doubling over the past five years as tax revenue surged outstripping defence expenditures. Earlier this month, however, BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda signalled he planned to allow Japan's core price index to edge up toward his three-percent target for this year or 2014. That step should bring some hope that the central bank can begin pushing inflation higher further soon. It has not ruled anything out but warned the country must guard against overheating in the housing market, high employment, weak investment and persistent wage cuts amid global economic uncertainty.",
    "Former US president John F Kennedy has criticised the tax system in Britain, saying it was unfair and that he would have liked to see more people paying their fair share. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Mr Kennedy said: \"I think we are taxing too much at present.\" He added: \"We should be taxing less and spending more on health care and education.\"\n\nIn other words, JFK didn't like the way the British tax system works. But he also didn't want to change it. So what did he do? He tried to get rid of it!\n\nThis is not surprising. As I've written before, the UK's tax system is designed to encourage saving and investment. It's designed to make sure that the rich pay a lot more than they need to. And it's designed to discourage work.\n\nSo if you're a wealthy person who wants to save money for your retirement, you'll probably end up paying a higher rate of income tax than someone who doesn't earn as much. If you're a working person who wants to invest some of your hard-earned cash, you might find yourself paying a lower rate of income tax than someone who earns a lot more.\n\nAnd this isn't just about the rich. This is about everyone.\n\nIf you're a middle class worker earning £20,000 per year, you will pay a higher rate of income tax than someone earning £100,000 per year. That's because the government wants to ensure that the rich don't pay too little tax.\n\nBut if you're a millionaire earning £1 million per year, you won't pay any income tax at all. Because the government wants to ensure that the rich don't pay too much tax.\n\nIt's a vicious circle. The rich pay a lot more tax than they need to, so the government makes them pay even more. The poor pay a lot less tax than they need to, so the government makes them pay even less.\n\nThat's why the UK's tax system is so unfair. It encourages people to save and invest, but then punishes them when they fail to do so.\n\nAs I wrote last week, the UK's tax system is one of the most regressive in Europe. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the average taxpayer pays around 40% of his",

    "I was born in 1932, and I remember it well. It was a time when the world seemed to be falling apart. We were living through the Great Depression, and we had no idea what would happen next.\n\nWe didn't know that the stock market crash of 1929 would lead to the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. We didn't know that the United States would go into World War II, or that the Soviet Union would invade Poland. We didn't know that the U.S. economy would collapse in the early 1940s, or that the Japanese would attack Pearl Harbor. And we certainly didn't know that the war would last for more than two years.\n\nBut we did know that our country was going down the tubes.\n\nAnd so, as the 1930s came to an end, my parents decided to move us out of New York City and into a small town called Westport, Connecticut. They wanted me to grow up there, away from the city lights and the noise. But they also knew that if things got bad enough, they could always come back home.\n\nSo they packed their bags and headed west.\n\nThey left behind everything they'd known. My father worked at a factory making steel beams; my mother worked as a secretary. They bought a house on a quiet street in Westport, where they raised three children — me, my older brother, and my younger sister.\n\nMy parents never told me why they moved to Westport. Maybe they thought it would make me feel less alone. Or maybe they just felt like they needed a change. Whatever the reason, they made the decision to leave New York City behind them.\n\nWhen I was about 10 years old, my family moved again. This time, they went to a place called Greenwich Village. There, they lived with other families who were struggling to survive during the Great Depression.\n\nIt wasn't long before my parents started having financial problems. In 1931, my dad lost his job at the factory he worked at. He couldn't find another one until 1933, when he found work at a local bank. By then, though, he was already working too many hours. So he quit and took a new job at a grocery store.\n\nBy 1935, my parents' finances were even worse. They were broke. They had no money to pay rent. They",

I grew up in a neighborhood called Brownsville where I played basketball, and football, and baseball, because that was all there was to do. My high school graduation photo is a photograph of me, standing in front of my high school's graduation colors—sunny blue, yellow, brown, and white—from a moment in time when they were the only colors I'd ever felt like wearing. For me they symbolized a joy in belonging, a deep sadness in having to leave everything behind, a deep joy in having a purpose.\n\nTo be honest, I was only in the fifth grade when I wrote my first poem, and it was so long ago I can't remember what the title of it was. In high school, after I took a class called \"Compositional Studies,\" I decided to write a book about one of my favorite topics—the poems of J.M.W. Turner; at the end of the class the teacher had read several of his poems—which he'd been publishing in Poetry magazine.\n\nThat is how I got my first poetry book: Poetry by J.M.W. Turner. I never knew what I was doing, though, and by the time I had to write a review of that book for one of my high school newspapers, and the other reviewer had been to one of Turner's readings at Brooklyn College, the book was in such bad shape that my editors",
    "On the night of her twenty-fifth birthday, Jessica got home to find that she was missing from both her home and her favorite place in town. He had disappeared into her heart, leaving behind nothing but thoughts; memories of his passion and his strength…\n\nHer friends were very concerned about her and asked if there were any other suspects out there with connections to the crime which took him away. Their worries helped turn things around for her, helping make the case more solid. Her father's name came up during one of the investigations as well, however it turned out Jessica could not remember anything about him…until after she began writing her own story…\n\nShe has spent so many years living with no memory and then suddenly remembering what happened. Jessica wanted people to know her love for him first by giving them an important book when he gets back, but now doesn't want anyone else knowing her story either. She is keeping quiet about everything until they meet again, waiting to see that someone remembers her too…",

    "I am not sure if I have ever been so happy to be alive as when I was in my brother's arms, holding him close and kissing his cheek. He had just come out of surgery for an infection on his leg, and he looked like he'd never run a race before. His face was still swollen and red, but it wasn't painful at all. We were both laughing and crying together, and we didn't care that our clothes were soaked with blood. It felt good to be able to hold each other again.\n\nWe spent the next few days playing video games and watching movies. When I got home, I took off my shirt and bra and laid them on the bed. Then I put on my sister's dress and shoes. She wore her hair down and her makeup was perfect. I kissed her forehead and told her how much she meant to me.\n\nWhen I went into the bathroom, I saw that my brother had changed into pajamas. I asked him what he wanted to do first, and he said he wanted to watch TV. I sat on the edge of the bed and watched him sit on the couch and play with his Xbox controller. I thought about how much fun it would be to make love to him while he played video games.\n\nHe came back into the room after a minute or two, and I could tell by the look on his face that he was disappointed. He said he wanted to go outside and get some air. I told him that I wanted to stay inside and read a book. He agreed, and then he left.\n\nI lay there reading until I fell asleep. The next morning, I woke up feeling very tired. I decided to take a shower and shave my legs. I walked downstairs and found my brother waiting for me. He smiled at me and gave me a big hug. I hugged him back and told him how much I loved him. He laughed and said he knew exactly why I liked him so much.\n\nThat night, I stayed up late reading and thinking about everything that happened last night. I couldn't stop smiling. I realized that I really did love my brother.",

    "I am not sure if I have ever been so happy as when I was in my room, reading and writing poems. The walls were covered with books, and there was no one else around to disturb me. It was like being at home again. And then I heard someone coming down the stairs. I looked up and saw that it was my father. He came into my room and sat on the edge of my bed. He said, \"You are very lucky, Leander.\" Then he took out his wallet and gave me some money. He told me to go to school tomorrow morning. I went to school and did well. My teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I answered, \"A poet.\" She laughed and said, \"Well, you will never make it as a poet.\" But she didn't say anything about how hard it would be for me to get a job. When I got back home, I wrote a poem. I called it \"And Leander,\" because I thought it sounded like a name for a dog. I had just finished it when my mother came in. She said, \"What's wrong?\" I replied, \"My father has given me some money.\" She said, \"Oh, that's great! You can buy your own dog!\" So I bought a puppy. I named him Leander. He was a good boy. He always stayed close by me. One day, I decided to write another poem. I put the words \"Leander\" in front of each line. I started to read it aloud to my father. He stopped me. He said, \"No, don't do that. That isn't poetry.\" I said, \"Why not? What does it matter whether it is or isn't?\" He said, \"It doesn't matter. It's only a word.\" I said, \"But it means something. It's a part of who I am.\" He said, \"Yes, but it's only a word.\" I said, \"Then why don't you let me use it?\" He said, \"Because it's not a word.\" I said, \"Then why don't you let me use it?\" He said, \"Because it's not a word.\" I said, \"Then why don't you let me use it?\" He said, \"Because it's not a word.\" I said, \"Then why don't",

    "I'm not sure if I've ever been so happy to be alive as when I was in my twenties, and I had money. Money meant that I could buy things with it, like clothes or cars or houses. It also meant that I didn't have to work for them. And it meant that I could spend time with people who were more important than me. But then I got older and realized that money wasn't everything. That's why I wrote this poem.\n\nIt's about how money can make you feel good but it doesn't always mean what you think it means. Sometimes it just makes you feel bad.\n\nAnd sometimes it makes you feel really good.\n\nSometimes it makes you feel like you're rich.\n\nBut sometimes it makes you feel like you're poor.\n\nSo maybe you should stop thinking about money all the time.

    "Mary, Mother Of Jesus By Tom Jurek\n\nDear Mary, I am writing to you first and foremost because you are my primary reference for all things I love in the world and because you were (and still are) my first love. You are so, so special. There are many things in my life that are now important because of your, in a word, godlike character. It is that character that drew me in and it is that character that keeps drawing me back to you. Every time I am at a dead end or someone breaks my heart, I come here to you, just in case I need a miracle. Because of you I have felt better after tragedy, I have felt hopeful after pain. It was you that taught me how to laugh, and you that taught me how to cry, and you know, and I know, that all of this without you would have been impossible. You are the love of my life. How could I ever repay you for that? How could I ever repay you for the many times you were my inspiration and my joy? No one who loves you could ever truly appreciate the miracle of being in your presence for as long as I have. If I were not your Mother, I would have no hope for a future and a life. Now I know. You have helped me understand in ways I never could have known, things about myself that I would have never been able to explain to those that didn't know me. You have filled my world with a love that is not given to me and that cannot be earned. I will not let you leave me unless you will. You may no longer be with me, but I know that the one who is with me is your son, Jesus. I know that I am the only one who has seen him, the one who has seen the miracle that his soul brings to the world. It is because of you that I continue to hold the hope of living a life of hope, because of you that Jesus has been given a path to follow in his life and because of you that his Father has given me purpose, now and forevermore. Now, Tom Jurek, I must finish the poem.\n\n\nYou Are My Primary Reference For All Things I Love In The World\n\nDear Mary, You are my primary reference for all things that I love in the world and for all of the love I have ever",
    "I'd give everything to forget about me… But no. What I've seen of war\n\nhas been too gruesome, like some strange painting. Some thing deep in our minds – like memories that we need to unplug. Something we have to keep hidden from ourselves forever — never letting it out but keeping secrets and scars there just beneath the surface… Like what happened when my great grandmother died and her ashes still lay here on this Earth; something I needed to hold on to so she couldn't see it… A terrible wound between us. Something I wish I'd stayed buried under.\n\nWhen faced with the unimaginable horror of war: \"If you think they're going to take from us all what's ours, then the best course it is to fight like hell.\" How am I supposed to live without the life of others? And even more painful: what if no one wants or needs me anymore after hearing these things?\n\nOur souls are inextricably entwined, and for any soul to be truly free — well it simply isn't possible. To not care or feel regret for those who were killed; for them always to exist in my eyes. As life passes by I can try to make peace with the loss I've experienced through my family, with my friends, with my countrymen, with every living being on earth. However, each person leaves a different shadow behind. It is only as long as an individual lingers and we connect — the kind of eternal connection that ties people's minds together … to make their voices seem like they're one man. And as soon as it breaks down… Then there will be nothing left.\n\nIt was very hot out yesterday as I walked home alone. With the wind tearing at my skin trying to carry the dirt away, there wasn't anything left for myself except my tears. After walking home, I saw my house across the street slowly crumble — its facade crumbling slowly over my mother's face once more. That's when I felt it: The war was starting again and nobody cares. Everybody knows you got hurt or sick and don't want to bother dealing with it right now: because people who get hit like me … have no place around here anyway! And besides… They're killing innocent women every day… There have got to be ways to stop a war, otherwise it'll go on forever… Right?\n\n\nWhat does any of",

    "\"Every child dreams of a hero.\"\n\nI wish that every child could imagine their hero. Every child has a fantasy about their own hero. Whether it be a hero from any book or a legend from any myth, they have that hero inside of them that they could see on the page. But their hero may not be the right type of hero. Perhaps that Hero is too dangerous. Or the Hero's family is too horrible. Or there is a conflict between the Hero and their family.\n\nA few days ago I had a difficult dream.\n\nThe dream was disturbing to say the least and it left me with several questions about the true purpose of my life. I have a son. He was 4 or 5 years old at the time. I remember him telling me that the main character in his fairy tales was never the wise and benevolent hero. The main character was always in a bit of a bind, that in the story the hero was always in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up in a bad place.\n\nThe hero would always have a flaw, never make good choices (including making choices that his parents disapproved of). He would become the victim of circumstance, never the aggressor. Maybe his family was unfair, maybe was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It didn't matter. He would never be the hero.\n\nThere was a difference. There was purpose to being the hero. The hero had to do something.\n\nOn the night when I had the dream I was thinking about my son. I was thinking about how I failed. Maybe it was the choice that night, maybe it was when he told me a lie that made all this happen. But I never let himself believe it. I kept thinking how he would be a hero and I would still be his father, or maybe in some other way.\n\nI woke with a pounding headache and saw the lights. No one was home but me. The television was on. And there was a small boy in his bed. In the living room was a TV. The TV wasn't on though. He was still there. He was not asleep. I ran to him and hugged him. When I pulled away I saw the child's father in his bed. The father was slumped against the wall. The father was not dressed as usual. What had happened? And then there was the child holding tightly",
    "This is June at Woodruff: \"I wonder whether all my trouble has been worth your pleasure; It's no use thinking, it cannot be so. The last words I heard were 'Come join us.' You'll never know. You will be too good for that; you always are.\" June is an American poetess.\n\nShe was born on 1 July 1899 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Robert Ocksell who worked as a telephone operator and John Rolison, who served as a US Post Office employee. In 1928 Ms. Ockfield won Mrs. Merton Cooper Prize in San Francisco, where she lived during her adult years and died in 1975, seven years after her death by cancer. After graduating from Carnegie-Mellon University with a Bachelor Degree in English (1941), she received a Master Degree from Stanford University (BA 1955). Although not writing poetry regularly before this time, Ms. Ockfield established her literary identity through a variety of works including columns for Woman's Art for several decades in the 1950s during which time, she wrote about her personal emotions in her poems, including poignant pieces like \"In A New Land,\" about the pain endured when young people return to their native land after spending their lives elsewhere. Ms. Ockfield subsequently authored numerous novels including those The Child Cat and Sweetheart River, both published posthumously in 1956 and The Lady Godiva Chronicles later in 1957 -- some twenty years after her own demise.\n\nThe following section includes excerpts from Ms. Ockfield's original manuscripts, found in the collection by her son Peter Lass. Many of these have been translated into other languages. Some contain additional scenes from the actual events. She also sent us copies of works from three autobiographical journals which are included as well. They offer an insight into how Mary's life shaped herself but they can only convey part of Mary's story and there must remain portions left unsaid herefor reasons such as our inability to fully reconstruct or understand the day on which we publish this account. Also, some items on this page contain quotes that may not necessarily reflect current beliefs. Please note that Mary Ockfield, known as Ockley by her many admirers, never married nor had children in spite one theory that posits that she did marry; thus one should neither assume that she would agree with someone else's views about marriage or children; nor that any of",

    "You give birth and then you wait till after death.\n\nThe wait is more than you think.\n\nThere are five different methods and every one of them has risks. Do you know the last method?\n\nIt is a secret.\n\nIt is the end of birth control.\n\nIt leaves women alone with men.\n\nOne can have the best sex ever and still have no child.\n\nOne has to be sure at the time of intercourse that she knows all the reasons why her fertility will not be replenished.\n\nOne must be sure which method of birth control she's been using, to prevent her from being pregnant.\n\nYou should have a child as soon as you can. The sooner, the better. Birth control is murder.\n\nThe following is the full text of an article titled \"Birth Control Does Nothing\", from health-line.org:\n\nA recent study, called a meta-analysis, found that birth control does nothing for reducing STDs, pregnancy or pregnancy complications and that abortion is even more effective at preventing pregnancy than birth control. So if abortion is better, why do we keep having it? Because the Bible says it's better. The Bible is our most ancient tradition and the first written document ever written, over a 10,000-year period; it was a very simple document, describing how a marriage would take place and the basic rights and duties of the husband and wife. To modern ears, the Bible seems to have no real value. It's full of superstition concerning sex, marriage, marriage vows, and pregnancy and parenting. The main reason why many countries put restrictions on abortion is because of the Bible. This doesn't make sense, but birth control does, and it's the main reason for the world's abortions. The World Health Organization calls birth control \"the most effective way to reduce the number of women who become pregnant and deliver babies prematurely.\" The CDC and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have stated that there are five (5) methods of birth control: condom, female condom, withdrawal, withdrawal coitus interruptus, and other. It should be noted that the CDC and CDC report only the number of pregnancies per year and do not estimate how many women will never give birth as a result of using any one of them. According to the CDC, condoms prevent an estimated 46,850 pregnancies per",

No no don't look away Just look right through this piece of paper Oh and remember something my dear Lord Don't think for a moment that you can forget about me Don't think only of him - think also of her who loves your own self For goodness sake forget everything and let go Do you hear God's sound saying Let it happen Let it start Now it is over there There will soon come no more To save yourself or your life From the pain I'm talking to you The agony just keeps mounting up It's so frightening that all day long you wonder Where are these strange thoughts coming from They make you feel too sorry to sleep because there aren't any dreams You can't shake them like so many people have tried You can't explain why you keep asking Him about this so very painful thought Your mother taught us a terrible sentence - Love doesn't leave a single trace At the same time as you suffer You're living an existence which makes your heart cry You do not understand the meaning of happiness How do you know you want it you can't stop wondering what your next step should be but you refuse to give up you'll always live with uncertainty Never knowing if any night of bliss can ever arrive The dark shadow of regret and darkness hangs like shrouds over your soul So be brave my brother and let the storm be under the ground But when God seems to call out to you He seems sad in its message.

    "I am an American, born and raised in New York City. My parents were both immigrants from Ireland. They came to this country with nothing but dreams and aspirations. They worked hard for everything they had. They sacrificed so much for their children and their families. And yet, despite all that, my family was never rich. We lived paycheck-to-paycheck. We struggled to make ends meet. But we always made it work. Because we believed in America. Because we knew that if you work hard enough, you can achieve anything. If you believe in yourself, you will succeed. That's what my parents taught me. And that's why I love this country.\n\nMy father was a carpenter by trade. He built houses and cars. He also owned a small business making wooden furniture. When he wasn't working, he spent his time playing golf or fishing. He loved to fish because he could catch so many different kinds of fish. One day, while fishing on the Hudson River, he caught a big one. He brought it home and showed it to me. I thought it looked like a nice piece of wood. So I took it home and started cutting it up into pieces. Then I put them together and made some chairs out of it. I named them after my favorite sports teams. The Yankees and the Giants. I called them the Iggles.\n\nOne day, my dad told me about something he'd been thinking about. He said he wanted to build a house. A real house. Not just any old house. Something special. Something that would last forever. He asked me if I wanted to help him build it. I said sure. I didn't know how to build things, but I figured I could at least learn how to do it. So I went down to the basement and started learning how to build things. I learned how to use tools and saws. I even got a little bit of carpentry training. After a few months, I was able to build a couple of simple homes. But then my dad decided he needed more help. He hired a contractor to come over and help him build a bigger house. This new house was going to be bigger than the previous ones. It was going to have a lot more rooms. More bedrooms. More bathrooms. More living spaces. And it was going to cost a lot more money.\n\nBut before",

Smith and Ronald Reagan. I looked at my watch -- it was 8:00 p.m. -- and realized that I had to go. It was time to end this chapter and move into the next. I pulled the black hood of my trench coat tighter around myself and stuffed a handful of ice in each pocket. I turned off the TV and walked to my room to cry.\n\nI lay down in my bed, held as still as I could, and sobbed. Eventually I could bring myself to face the television, where it suddenly appeared that an article I had written on the deaths of Paul W. Smith and Ronald Reagan was being played. It showed the bodies of Smith and Reagan, wrapped in black shrouds, being dragged from helicopters and flown out to sea. It was an awful sight -- the two men they were supposed to have been fighting and winning against had been taken out. I realized that nothing I had ever done or said had changed the facts -- nothing in my life had.\n\nI was devastated and I realized that it was over. The people who had claimed to love me had taken away my reason and made me numb. The people who had claimed to love me had made me a victim.\n\nI laid there, in my bed, crying as my mind began to wonder: Where was I? I couldn't remember what town I was in, but when I finally came to, it was in a very different place than I had thought. I'd missed something very important, and now I would have to go back and start all over -- but without the memories of friends, family, and country. Now I was alone.\n\nAfter a minute or two my tears began to subside, and I laid back in a comfortable recliner and watched the sad thing on TV for a long time. As the hours passed and I saw the time tick past, I learned that the article I had written on Paul W. Smith and Ronald Reagan had been one of three articles run on my death. I thought more about what I had been missing for the last several centuries. I realized that the only person I had ever made real friends",
    "Meera: A-ha, my beloved.\n\nShe: A-huh? Well, it certainly would have been nice to have something nice in the morning.\n\nMe: (a couple of minutes later) Don't forget to lock the doors.\n\nShe: I think I have, and now that I have they can't help me if they've got you locked up.\n\nMe: You should be more careful.\n\nShe: I'll try.\n\nMeera: (dumbfounded)\n\nShe: Oh no. No, no. No.\n\nMe: I will. Just please shut the damn door.\n\nShe (waving her hands) Well, you can't shut me up.\n\nMe: You won't.\n\nShe: Maybe, just maybe, I could leave this room, and I could come home and kiss him for a while.\n\nMe: I'll come with you.\n\nShe: Oh, thank you. I'm so glad, I will be so happy.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSo now you understand why marriage is so important to her.\n\nA very special man like her should probably keep his feelings for her close to the chest and only get together with her in times where they can have some kind of normal friendship.\n\nOn the rare occasion where there is a conflict or there is a rift between them he must realize that that is not going to solve her problems.\n\nWhen they have children, she will be more than a daughter, and that makes all the difference.\n\nShe is more than the love of a good man as she will never be a perfect daughter anymore, and his love will only get in the way of her happiness and needs. She will always be an imperfect daughter and will never be perfect, not even if she marries him, which she never planned.\n\nIt is best for you that if you can marry someone with a problem like that that you go into it with a completely open mind and that you are prepared to work through it.\n\nBut if not, then just realize that there are many women out there with exactly the same need, and they are out there waiting for you to fill it.\n\nSo what do you think?",
    "I am not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. The end of a snake.\n\nIt's been a long time since I've seen one, and I'm not sure if they're still around or not. But I do know that snakes are dangerous creatures. They can bite you, and they can kill you. And when they die, they go to hell.\n\nSo I guess I'll just have to live with that.\n\nAnd now, for some reason, I feel like I need to write about them.\n\nThey're everywhere. In my house, in my yard, on the street. Everywhere.\n\nIn fact, there's so many of them, I don't even know where to start.\n\nBut I think I'll start with the most common type of snake.\n\nThe Cottonmouth.\n\nCottonmouths are the largest species of venomous snake in North America. They're also known as rattlesnakes because their rattling sounds resemble a rattler.\n\nMost people who see a cottonmouth will assume it's a harmless animal. It doesn't look threatening at all.\n\nHowever, the cottonmouth has a nasty habit of biting its prey. If you get bitten by a cottonmouth, you might experience pain, swelling, redness, and bleeding. You may also experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, headache, dizziness, weakness, and muscle aches.\n\nIf you're allergic to any of these symptoms, you should seek medical attention immediately.\n\nYou can find out more information about how to avoid being bitten by a cottonmouth here.\n\nNow let's talk about the other types of snakes.\n\nThere are two kinds of poisonous snakes in North America – pit vipers and coral snakes. Pit vipers are found throughout the United States, while coral snakes are only found in Florida.\n\nPit vipers are generally larger than cottonmouths, and they tend to be darker in color. Coral snakes are smaller than pit vipers, and they tend to be lighter in color. Both pit vipers and coral snakes are considered dangerous animals.\n\nBoth pit vipers and coral snakes are venomous. However, coral snakes are usually much less toxic than pit vipers.\n\nHere are some facts about pit vipers and coral snakes:",
    "MOM [JOE]\nShe said I never had enough friends because sometimes if I stayed out late and had too many girls in my room someone called and someones name\n'Hey baby its Joe!'\nSo my Mom started to have me take baths instead for awhile when I was young but now she has always left early, leaving her purse on the front porch of her home, where it's all by default, there are no bills or anything so I always get to hang around the house alone when I am over here at 11, I love mom and have been with her since I can remember, even though not really with any children for about 6 years we were together until I met Joe who I still have love affair with to this day he even says he loves my dad more than her!\nI wish I could just go back to that time when I first met Joe he introduced me as his girlfriend you know how men think\nso we were dating for awhile and I felt like we were having sex every 5 weeks for my whole relationship\nhe always took me shopping in the department stores to buy women'stuff', he always kept women looking nice and then told me that they look better naked and put on something nice\na man must be good looking too I thought, that doesn't hurt me that he likes it and wants to keep me around him just see?

    "I've tried to break down the barriers that divide women and their sexuality throughout my life, and today I realized that one barrier that's as much a part of what it means to be gay/lesbian as anything else…is not being alive when someone passes away for no logical reason!!…I was wondering if anyone knew any poems, short pieces about death in which the deceased partner had nothing to do with and the poet could portray both emotions? Here are some examples (all were written by me):\n\nOne Night She Fell In My Arms And Died As If By Suicide. [My boyfriends late girlfriend] died one night before we married after only 6 months together [when we broke up over sexual tension]. Her bedside was just a thin strip of black fabric next to my husband's body…She would come home every few nights and sleep on our sheets while staring at her photo on his dresser, or she would lean against my side wall while her eyes stared out into space. It wasn't until she didn't answer any of us during the last call did we realize she hadn't come back. There would never be another phone call or a letter. On the way to the graveyard I thought of all the times we went to dinner, or went out shopping for groceries or took those long walks together; you'll always remember your beloved one.\"\n\nInvisible Death: The Last Dance. \"It started out so well. We sat around like old lovers sitting by a fireplace. The fire crackled softly under an invisible cloud.\n\nAs you looked through the window, the tiny town's skyline grew larger and more real, until eventually there became such a view that you felt really dizzy and disoriented from everything going in front of you. You couldn't see each other in the town itself, but you saw yourself, on the distant horizon – you stood there gazing off into the distance and wondered how you got here, who gave birth to you, was you even in this world?\"\n\nHappily Ever After. I have been watching through your eyes The little red wedding ring gleaming white through the window You held tightly between your fingers Holding me and kissing me softly as we sang along with each other \"You took my heart right from under my feet and put it behind Your right shoulder where you'd walk forever\". What about Now I look across the room and there's the man you love,",

    "Dread\n\nDread is the heartless\n\nand the unfeeling and unkind?\n\nThe world is the dream of a dreamer\n\nand the dreams of people\n\ncome in the form of dreams.\n\nIt can be said that even the most\n\nprudent of them would be wise to give\n\na little of their lives to\n\nthe pursuit of happiness.\n\nWhat better thing is there?\n\nThe things it offers\n\nsuffer no changes of heart.\n\nIt leads the wise\n\nthrough an endless night\n\nthat is as dark as night.\n\nThe things it offers\n\nwould be a far worse loss\n\nto an unwary person.\n\nWhy is it, then, that even\n\nwhen it is offered in exchange\n\nfor a treasure of other value\n\nit is rejected?\n\nAs for myself, my heart\n\nis set forever on the dark side\n\nand its only hope\n\nis the destruction to all\n\nwho would enter my domain.\n\nEven then my only reward\n\nis for the soul\n\nof its own creator to be set fire to.\n\nI have, at times, tried to\n\navoid the night by pretending\n\nthat I saw only things that\n\ndid not truly exist.\n\nBut I was not able to avoid\n\nthe darkness, as it was not\n\na thing that could be ignored.\n\nDread is also known as the fear of death, and since the fear and sorrow of the passing of the body is so deeply entrenched in the human mind, it stands to reason that our fear of death is rooted fundamentally in the dread of having no lasting existence.\n\nThis is why many religions consider death an important religious teaching. For some, death can be treated and overcome by meditation and spiritual practices, but for others, death is the final consequence of their sinful actions, and they seek to avoid it through fear, self-denial, and sacrifice.\n\nIn the context of the Christian Gospel, the death of Jesus Christ is often understood not to be God's final judgment on humanity. Christ's death on the cross is seen as a victory before God over sinning humanity, and it is understood that the Spirit will one day fill the earth with his presence so as to provide us with eternal life",

    "Dear Friend, if you feel that your world could benefit from reading poetry like this or other poems by such writers as Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Walker or Allen Ginsberg, there are several fantastic places to start. I'm not saying there's ever just one right way of doing it… But there are certain steps and techniques which seem particularly appropriate to what kind of poet one wants to become (and also perhaps ways in which one might find oneself on some day — say, at four o'clock in the afternoon on an overcast spring day — at which point you happen upon all these writings, all these authors). You will probably find them in this site – the Poetry Foundation was initially set up more for people interested in writing than finding places to read.\n\nSome years ago, when I first started teaching at the University of Minnesota, my students who were serious about getting into college often asked how they would start, particularly those who had grown up elsewhere but had never studied English literature, poetry or art in school. In their opinion, many books existed but had been neglected or forgotten or ignored or even outright rejected…. One question asked by my young students always came back, however, with the added weight to say where was the place of the author? As teachers we talked through a number of possible routes: museums, bookshops, libraries – only occasionally would someone mention a good university bookstore with readings – if available; book-lovers groups, book clubs and organizations dedicated entirely to acquiring, carrying or selling the likes of Thomas Arnold, J.M. Coetzee-type novels (the latter seemed especially appropriate as one could buy these things from every corner of the country and get them delivered immediately to his or her doorstep, even though almost no one did); maybe the best bet, it seemed to me — was going out looking for the works themselves! (Or if a specific poet or writer was unknown to anyone, then that person's books or poems might be found without too much trouble in a particular city or town.)\n\nThere are countless ways to find something written by a great writer and it can take some time. But the results of searching and scouring are always worth while… if, that is, you look hard enough … and go well enough out into neighborhoods, cafes, coffee shops that offer the chance of an encounter that can be difficult, boring, lonely, strange or exhilarating, especially if",
    "In winter thou inest to make balm unto my life, If we should meet at some time or other; For now this bright new year brings with it another day Of sorrowful waiting and dreadfulness, Though no more shall our hearts pine away With that bitter remembrance which comes from sorrow, And evermore mayst thou be mine, till to-morrow morning light Will come again on us with joy like spring rains upon leafless trees. Then mayst thou give me back my last love's name, Nor take from me my very own, for the gift That in thee thou hast given me. By thy beauty and by my love shall fall The same burden which once brought forth my sorrow And made my heart to pine away; While in thy fair name my heart will burn Like living flames that flow through every part Of the earth when that sun goes down, Whose fiery beams cast shadow on all. So let me kiss thee in wintertime; While thou shalt live, so have my feet begun To feel as they are born anew in May, In summer mayst thou know that this hour of trouble Is passing swiftly in memory and fancy. My memories are few, not many nor great; But all were good things in days where pain could be borne. Now mayst thou remember them and give me a rest. Love thou art to love, true love in thee doth stay. Love can bear up this world, which seems broken For lack of him who loves, not because he knows Not what his future holds but Because it would not contain him; For this thing shall never return, Thee in my soul still love can find. What else can thou show that men could use? Thus hath love found a place in this world of decay, Where nothing but the spirit moves with a beating pulse. Thy presence in such season may keep life together, It must needs be enough for thee, yet one desire Keeps out the thoughts that dwell there forlornly. Thou makest much cheer here, O beautiful one; And if thou wilt see more of our land Then give me leave to seek thy beauty here and then: Take with thee your dear son whom thou lovest best, O sweet prince, that I may see you first of all; Otherwise these flowers too will scarce bloom.

    "I dare I hope, that all this will end some day soon The goodbyes will vanish in the distance, And the only way to start again Is to start right now with life I always thought it would be the perfect time When you say goodnight with one last hug, But what can we expect when someone else comes knocking. Maybe there's something else out there too, A little more love than time and space are willing to give That somehow just might make it through. In my heart, every moment I spend in happiness Never fails to pull away from me A glimmer of hope that keeps on lighting up the next moment Of course, these days are like they're going down hill slow as molasses You may want to ask yourself, have I sacrificed so much For nothing? Has there anything left for me To hold onto that isn't breaking apart at such an alarming rate I feel like everyone's got his or her hands into the works The economy doesn't add new cars; your home goes up in smoke, You'll never see another person again Your kids will leave you behind They'll be out of work by the year's end And where on Earth could you go From here but back to how you were All those years ago when everybody was so afraid to live On this side of life, it made sense There was no escape from real pain Nothing left, except to try something different, Something you wouldn't have wanted, had you known.

    "Hark, for he's singing In honor of his God:\n\nHe sings of how all our world was created By one man, who in this day, Must be called by no name, but The Almighty! All nature shall sing With this song. Every leaf and twig Of every tree on which we behold A mighty human hand worketh; The gentle air has breathed its breath Into every cell That moves upon it, And through living waters That flow by all that move.\n\nAnd, yet, not such as you feel! Not with reverence do I call thee; You alone are my brother. And know thou now that thou hast But ten steps to travel, Before my spirit shall leave thy breast, Which thou have loved above all. So will I stay Here, where I am always: Till after my time comes Thy word of farewell. What wouldst thou have me say? Wherefore so many wander? Why still these old graves and earth-walls To hear their last voices, when they die And sink beneath thine awful form?\n\nThey seek the place—the Garden of Eden's Tree, That buddiest of the buds that grow; Then when night cometh all nature falls, While all dreams, strange thoughts and loves pass From off its branches. Their hands are bound, their minds filled with fear. Yet, despite all their fears, No more shall ever cease; The great mystery I bear may remain, The whole universe itself (beyond what it contains) Be still the place, where there Are trees all in all; there Shall be forever For all beings an eternal rest.\n\nWhen he returns he will sing Of him that made them all. He will praise her beauty and goodness, With flowers bright or blossom-like, Or at dawn, as if she were sleeping; And even when he reaches home, as his soul is leaving The body, he shall see her smiling On his way home.\n\nThou hadst said this to thee then And with tears shalt tell them all in sorrow, As I weep; though thy lightness hath melted away My weeping. Yet my voice is strong, and I shall cry. They will see, and remember all, And weep and grieve like us.\n\nI cannot bear Their memory, only love Can find grace in it: 'Tis to speak their glory: Thus in the story of Adam and Eve",

    "One 8-inch batch of sweet onions goes into the bottom pan filled halfway, 1/2 at a time with about 2 quarts of boiling water; then add 4 cups of flour mixed with salt and sugar (use regular white table salt if baking) and turn on low heat for one hour or so until mixture bubbles up and thickens (I used my slow cooker which can hold several crock pots at once), turning them occasionally to cook evenly. When very dark golden brown, test by cutting thin strips through the surface and pull the slices out easily. Let chill before slicing thinly and sautéing thoroughly in butter and olive oil together. This will remove some of the sharp sour taste, but it's best to enjoy the sauce after it is made because that's when it's most tangy–no longer fresh as it's still cooling off, but instead more like a classic homemade version of the sauce without any added seasonings. Use this flavor alone or dress up this simple recipe just like you would any dish—spice it up with black pepper and herbs and serve alongside your salad dressing. Enjoy! Recipe yields about 2 quarts of ready-to-eat finished dishes.\n\nNote: I bought these vegetables on sale at local stores. The first step in making this recipe was cutting the onion into about 6 rounds, each about 3 inches around. The larger ones required 3 separate batches to accommodate their size. The second part, glazing–which requires baking them as opposed to roasting the onions–was the easy part since they're already sliced anyway. To make the garlic a little extra zippy, I ground the dry ingredients and put those in a small bowl along with the roasted and peeled cloves of garlic I had saved off of last night's food preparation for dinner (if not using the whole lot just toss them in a small container so later, when you wish to grind your own, the cloves don't go to waste).\n\nIt should be noted that the photo of \"sweet red onions,\" above, are also a blend of 2 different types but both were yellowish orange while fresh (not yellowish brown); there was no need to use the same variety because of that but I was too lazy to do a comparison between them (like my pictures are below the ingredient list as well). What we did come up with was pretty good considering.",

    "\"I decided to create a sandwich out of a mixture of whole-wheat bread with Swiss cheese. This simple sandwich will impress your guests. It doesn't require much preparation.\n\nThe result is one delicious sweet bread, cheese and butter sandwich. The bread has a light flavor and a delicate aroma that will remind you of winter months. Each slice is slightly different. Some resemble wheat bread, while others have a sweet or savory tone.\n\nYou need only four different kinds of cheese for the creation of this sandwich: Emmentaler, Swiss, Emmental and Parmesan.

    "1 can of evaporated milk or other nondairy cream 1 cup of water 2 Tbsp sugar 2 tsp garlic powder ¼ tsp salt ¼ tsp pepper 1 tbsp coconut oil (or any kind of non-hydrogenated vegan oils)\n\nIn a small saucepan, heat the butter and melt over low flame until you get to soft and thick paste. This takes around 5 minutes on medium heat or so; use a whisk if necessary. Add the melted butter and continue cooking in batches for about 20 seconds at a time till all have been added or fully melted. Allow it to cool down to room temperature then stir through 1-2 cups of powdered eggs, lemon juice, and soy lecithin according to package instructions. Combine this in a mixing bowl. Beat the remaining egg yolk in a separate bowl with an electric beaters or whisk attachment until frothy. Fold 1/3 of this mixture into the evaporated milk. The rest needs to be strained separately in as few sips as possible before serving. In order for a purer texture without the creamy bits I suggest folding in ½ teaspoon of agar granule instead of pureed raw gelatin cubes. It reduces its volume by a lot so will make more liquid but the consistency will still be almost milk-free.

    "For this Zwanzeschen, I'm going to use a simple base—fresh plum jam made with fresh raspberries and strawberries that's been stirred into cream cheese. Then, we've made an Austrian plum-toast sandwich which consists of two layers: the sandwich itself topped with creamy ricotta with a pinch of sugar sprinkled on top for good measure; then on the crust, spread your chosen topping and a glug of freshly squeezed lemon juice for sprinkling around each piece—I've used dried cranberry and strawberry jams here because those were in my fridge! As we go along—and as you continue adding toppings—we'll also get more traditional Bavarian condiments such as honey, dill sauce, mustard powder, and maybe even sweet pickles. You can finish up with a garnish of finely sliced cucumber slices, fried eggs, etc.\n\n\nYou make the cake by breaking down both halves of the rolled out pastry, forming it into rectangles about 2/3″ thick, and scooping a couple of tablespoons onto each square until it forms the size of a ping pong ball after rolling it, then baking at 375°F for 20 minutes, making sure not to overcook. Meanwhile, prepare the sandwich by first breaking apart two cups of ricotta filling, spreading it out generously over top of one slice of cream cheese, then folding the other side in as well so that it covers some and slightly overlaps the outer layer of ricotta. Next, roll half the dough rectangle back up and carefully put it atop the fillings; add the second cup of stuffing and repeat the process covering with the second half of the dough strip, then gently pressing the edges together to seal. Cut an apple into three pieces; cut a jalapeno or scallop into six thin slices. And finally arrange all four pieces of fruit atop each raspberry jam sandwich, followed by whatever is piled on underneath...crisps, kraut, olives, etc.\n\nPriced at $2 each, they're worth every penny.",

    "\"Chipotle Chicken Grilled Chicken recipe from allrecipes.com. A good, cheap, no frills, one skillet cooker version of a classic dish – chicken grilled to get that crispy skin, chicken cooked quickly, and chicken in a spicy blend of chipotle peppers, red onions, and garlic. The dish is perfect for those of us without grill marks – it's perfect for family reunions with the whole family.\"\n\nSo why don't a lot of places make grilled chicken in chipotle sauce? Well, a lot of grilling is cooking indoors in a large smoker at high temperatures over a relatively long period of time, typically several hours to a couple days. Not only does this create large, dense, and fatty pieces of chicken, but the smell of the smoke often creates a nauseating, acrid odor for those who are sensitive to the smell – particularly children.\n\nSo what you're left with is a dish that's not as flavorful or smoky as \"real\" grilled chicken. Chipotle and Chipotles are both known to cause nausea and headaches in some people. You can get this effect by getting raw onions or even jalapenos in the mix. Additionally, because the onions tend to be in concentrated quantities, that may end up making the dish taste more like ketchup when cooked.\n\nWhy are there a lot of Chipotle stores within walking distance of my local supermarkets?\n\nChipotle is a national, fast casual chain of fast food restaurants, which means that they often have their own brand of processed chicken. Chipotle chicken tends to have a strong chicken flavor, and are sometimes known to have a strange taste of garlic/onion. (That said, this is one thing that all Chipotle restaurants in the States will be different.) One of the ingredients used in these \"new \"chicken\" is a spice blend called Tabasco sauce. The only way to make the same flavor is to use the chipotle peppers you cut up yourself, instead of the chipotle peppers in a store brand.\n\nWhy don't I see more of the classic grilled chicken available?\n\nThere's only been one change in how \"real\" Chipotle is since I was a child: Chipotle added chipotle peppers to each and every chicken fillet they sold! Chipotle peppers made it easier to grill the chicken",
    "The name is derived from its resemblance to that lovely luscious tea. Lemon and Earl Grey are two of my favorite flavors, I would say the sweetness of Earl Grey has a slightly deeper and slightly sweeter flavor to me.\n\nIf you are using the original recipe (from allrecipes.com, not an archived copy) the recipe calls for both lemons and the actual ginger root. This is not a big deal if you are using fresh lemons. If you use frozen lemon or any kind of lemon you should use that in the recipe, as ginger has a natural antibacterial quality that can be good. You can use lemon juice only, but even then your may still need to cook 2-3 more minutes. The reason for the extra cooking is for the sugar. The fresh lemon juice also has a lot of lemons and sugar in it, making it go bad much faster than frozen. Also, this recipe is for lemons alone, as it gets a few extra ingredients added. Since both lemons and ginger are relatively inexpensive here in the US, I'll use them as required, but if you can get fresh lemons, that works perfectly fine too. (The same rules apply as when using frozen lemon for jam.)\n\nIngredients list:\n\n2-3 lemons, preferably organic\n\n3 to 4 fresh ginger root, freshly grated (any kind of ginger would do if you plan to use it in this recipe)\n\n2 tbsp honey, you can use agave or maple syrup\n\n2 tsp lemon peel + juice\n\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n\nDirections:\n\nIn a food processor, combine ginger root, lemon peel, garlic, honey and lemon juice. Run the processor and pulse until the ginger and the ingredients have blended. Slowly add the pureed ginger and lemon juice to the food processor and pulse until you reach a smooth, creamy texture. Transfer to a bowl.\n\nAdd lemon zest and juice, salt and pepper, and stir until combined. Taste for seasonings and adjust with more salt, more lemon juice, pepper, and honey (optional). Stir in sugar at this time.\n\nCover pot with foil and let sit on the counter to thaw for about 15 minutes. Remove foil from pot and let sit for a few minutes more to cool – this is the time when ginger needs to",

    "As with most meat and potatoes, these recipes use pork for flavor rather than bacon so you could technically make them without it.

Shape into log and wrap loosely around an ice cream scoop (for more detailed instructions, click HERE ), being sure both ends of the log have been crimped (as this helps trap air bubbles). Rewrap in plastic wrap, and let chill overnight. Preheat oven to 400F. Spoon large amount onto greased skillet (3 inch diameter surface), spreading evenly using tongs and tilting pan occasionally. Bake approximately 20 minutes for fries, 25 – 30 minutes for patties. Serve warm in shallow plate. NOTE : The first thing is to check to ensure both surfaces are nicely browned and crisp, then move fast while they're still hot! For the sauce, melt remaining butter in small heavy stockpot. Mix flour in 1 tbsp flour in small bowl; whisk vigorously until smooth. Slowly add milk slightly little by little while stirring constantly until combined and thickened enough for sauce sauce, about 3 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before using.\nWe recently learned the art of baking soda. It's amazing, really. It tastes like lemon extract with a hint of baking powder.

Roast until cooked to desired doneness, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place onions under a pan of boiling water to reduce them while stirring occasionally. Allow enough water to come up over ½ inch. Cook until translucent, about 3 minutes to remove any raw edges from onion's skin, breaking off small bits along the way. Scrape any clinging bits from skin with kitchen knife, then set aside. Heat oil in sauté pan to 350 degrees, over medium heat. Sauté onions for 2 – 5 minutes, until softened and browned. Gradually add flour, mixing until combined. Add reserved olive oil mixture and whisk until smooth, scraping food particles away with wooden spoon. Pour in garlic milk and mustard; bring to a quick simmer and scrape up any stray flaky bits.

Whisk remaining dry ingredients including baking powder in large bowl. Slowly whisk in melted chocolate from mixing bowl until combined (About 60 second stirring). Turn out onto floured surface and knead just 2 to 3 times. Knead 6 to 8 hours until well combined, dough will be tacky and sticky after adding last drop of cold milk (after 7 hours it should be smooth enough to handle lightly by hand), no additional work needed! Place ball of dough onto lightly scuffed or greased baking sheet; using offset spatula press down on both sides of dough with your thumb (I used my fingers like you would use for biscuit making!). Press and stretch a couple times so that edges fold gently into center. Do not pull out yet. Let dough rest 5 minutes, then continue pressing and stretching as directed above.

    "A few years ago, as a senior in high school, I decided that my dating/relationship-seeking career was coming to an end. While this did not necessarily mean I was ready to settle down (after all life can be so short), for some reason I had this thought I needed to make sure I have a long-term relationship if I wanted anything serious. So I began to research what it would take and realized that there are many different types of relationships out there: casual friendships, romantic relationships, etc., and now feel comfortable being gay or bisexual...but with someone just because they're'suspected.' As most people reading this will know, suspicion is the first thing that gets me. One day while cruising reddit through one of the articles mentioned above (I wasn't interested at the time) I stumbled onto an article detailing how an ex of mine took advantage of her suspicions of a girl she came into contact with on her break by sending suggestive texts before proposing. The article included examples showing the various ways an individual can use their trusty ol' social network to get attention based upon nothing more than their sexuality. So when I heard the term bisexuality coming up as well, I remembered my friend's mom who explained it. She also told me why \"being bisexual\" (read: suspicious) seemed like such an attractive option at that point - as it gives you plenty of choices and variety when choosing a potential partner, which is one less barrier you'll need to overcome to find love. Now since I made some progress after realizing I'm attracted solely to men I haven't been able to stop thinking about whether I fit into what being bi means. From what little information there still is surrounding this subject I've found that the main definitions and terms we all associate with it are quite arbitrary to everyone else. This led us to look further into how to define our sexuality and see if some of these labels could help clear things up... Read More...\n\nBisexual men who identify as feminist continue conversations regarding feminism I am often confronted by questions from various members of the BME community who ask for clarification on my definition of feminism because they hear in their generalizations that feminists don't want equality with masculinity. When answering this question, I must explain that, far from the case, I see the two concepts going hand in hand and I strive for the equality between both",
    "\"Do you work closely with your manager on a daily basis and they tell you what you can do/not be doing (because that is actually the worst thing someone could say) or does it become more passive (like, 'oh, we'll call it down to you in 15 minutes')?\" The \"yes, but no they don't mean it, I've got three children so when my husband asks me how he's doing, it annoys me.\"\n\nWell I want to ask my boss, because it feels like she doesn't know at all... How much are they working on their next album? We're talking \"soon\". And I guess they're trying to get into being able to tour. But really they have 2,000 kids in Africa and they have no funds right now to afford an apartment that would fit a single person. Or let alone two or ten people. When was the last time they came out with a new song?? When was the first show?? It seems obvious, but apparently that's so far beyond any thought that they have of making money. They spend millions on tours/accompanyments; maybe enough as a nation to pay off our entire debt by one day! Just think about this. My country is completely indebted, but still spends over $200 million dollars a year on entertainment.. Our music artists and producers spend almost half that. That means our biggest pop stars spend nearly as much yearly on their career than our school janitors! This has been documented with the rise of internet radio stations, streaming services such as Spotify etc., video upload sites such as Vimeo,... it was always supposed to happen. No more excuses, everyone needs to take responsibility -- I will bet anyone else who talks to their co-workers about this that most are horrified. So that is why there is no accountability among these people. Some companies may even hide in ignorance... I am so sick of people saying \"well, there are so many other opportunities out there - where can we put our focus? Where can we find someone else that actually listens to us? How are we supposed to survive? What can WE put on our resumes if we aren't here?\". That sounds good until you consider there will be 30 more years of life, not counting retirement and death, after that life is done! Oh dear lord....\n\nThis is why, while I love",
    "There are those that talk a lot about being on a no contact list and there are those who talk a little bit about it. And as usual, there are the trolls who make it more personal and more important. A couple people I know are currently on this list. No they're not on it to hurt me directly but to prove a point. One man wanted me to believe he was the love of my life and when I wasn't so sure and told him he was an idiot he went all off his rocker and started spamming, \"no contact\" along with a bunch of his friends and I have seen what they did to my own inbox. No one wants to start a war with people like that and it's sad to see what they can do to people who are trying to be a positive human being just trying to live their life.

I won't try to convince them otherwise, I don't give two shits but I am going to try and make them stop.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don't care what it takes to \"make them stop.\" It's probably not going to happen but I will try my best.

    "I'm working at a store and I noticed we have very few female staff in my department; no clerks, no stock guys, etc – basically nobody to talk to about what's going on. The co-workers aren't that awesome either because they're usually super busy in other departments or if you talk to one you can never get him off topic since he will always tell you he has something to do after work which means he will not help out customers who need assistance during the day. My co-worker, I can pretty much guess, works in Customer Service (Customer Service being the only major section for male employees) and the two times I've asked her about customer support she gave me weird stares like I was asking them how their morning went, saying things like:\n\n\n\"you all are terrible! You should feel bad because there isn't anything we want you to worry about around here.\" And before even getting into any conversation it became clear she doesn't really know stuff other than Customer Service stuff like having your order ready by X date so then just go home and relax while your coworkers eat their breakfast. They also don't understand that people sometimes have problems on their own, but rather are trying to resolve those issues more often than they actually do. When the manager saw this I called through for him on his cell phone to see what needs to be done. He said all that he could say is they had to go over schedules and make sure everything is running correctly as needed. She just continued on and told me they're looking to hire someone for our new position to replace our current clerk. I told him we tried to inform her of why it was a good idea for us, but she kept putting her hands in her pockets and staring across the room trying to figure anything out while continuing to answer questions she had to give.

    "We are having this discussion over at /r/leagueoflegends specifically because Riot currently has no way to make sure that their voices get heard on forums, in-clan chats and such. This isn't just for pro players either, we're talking about casuals as well; players who may be new on League or not interested (if they even really care) by going through the rigmaroles of getting their names change at all.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking: Riot would get lots of criticism on something like \"Why couldn't you give [Name] more attention in game\" if they'd added some sort of system that automatically changed his name when he posted. It makes sense they wouldn't want to ruin these cool moments though and just add it randomly; but also it does have potential downsides: people could do crazy shit where someone else gets their account banned in a few minutes due to them doing stupid things with this feature (e.g. giving themselves hilarious nicknames)! What I mean is that if they did put something into place to stop this that had downsides, it should definitely be an opt out rather than the default option.

    "I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there's been an explosion in interest in self-improvement lately. People are starting to realize that they don't have to be perfect all the time and that it doesn't matter how much money or fame they have if they're unhappy with themselves. It seems like everyone wants to improve their lives, so why not start now?\n\nSo here's my story. I was born into a family where we were always told that we had no choice but to work hard for everything we got. We worked our asses off every day, and when we weren't working, we were studying. My parents never let us go out without a job, and even though I didn't want to study, I knew that I needed to get good grades to get into college. So I studied harder than anyone else in school, and when I graduated high school, I went straight to college.\n\nWhen I first started at university, I thought I would just sit back and enjoy life. But then one night, I decided to take a break from studying and go on a date with a girl who lived across campus. She was cute, funny, and smart. After a few drinks, she asked me what I wanted to do after graduation. I said I'd love to travel, and she agreed. Then she asked me if I wanted to move in together. I said yes, and she said she loved me too.\n\nWe spent the next year traveling around Europe, visiting different countries, and having lots of fun. When we came home, we decided to try living together again. This time, however, things were going better. We made plans to buy a house together, and we bought a small apartment in downtown Toronto. Things seemed great!\n\nThen one day, I woke up to find her naked in bed with another guy. I freaked out, and tried to leave, but she wouldn't let me. Instead, she insisted that we sleep together. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I felt violated, and I couldn't understand why she would agree to this. I told her that I wasn't comfortable sleeping with someone I barely knew, and that I didn't think we should live together anymore. She said that she understood, and that she loved me anyway.\n\nAfter some more arguing, she finally gave in and moved in with me",
    "I am not diagnosed with depression because I don't share details about myself, because I have tried not to disclose details to make everyone comfortable.\n\nI didn't really find out about my mental health until high school, when one of my best friends passed away. It came as such a shock, I was in a really bad place for a really long time. I lost my job and my friends when that went down and I really didn't know how I was going to go on without them. I was also starting to get my life together professionally and I felt like a completely different person. There was just a constant feeling of losing the battle I was fighting and not knowing where I'd be without them. My mom was helping me a lot through that, but I kept wondering how I was going to get through high school without knowing if anyone else considered me \"normal\". (I am always told how important it is to not break anyone down, but then I think that when I tell people my depression is \"not in a public place\" and not \"something on Facebook\", or when I say that I feel like a broken shell...well, people assume something else. Even if I say it's something on my Facebook page, people assume something else.)\n\nThis last year I've been getting more support, but it really is very weird being in a position of dealing with your life, then having people not want to have anything to do with you. When people don't believe that I'd be able to go on without support, they act like it's no big deal to be in my position, and if you want to be able to talk about it like \"it's okay, we don't have any answers for you\", well...that just makes you feel so alone. I am so sad that I can't even have a conversation with my friends who I haven't spoken to in a long time, and I can't have a normal post on a public forum about my feelings...it's the most stressful that I can imagine.\n\nAfter so much time of feeling like I was dying, I have finally learned that it's OK, but it doesn't make me think so highly of myself. It is really just a matter of me figuring out how I want to manage it myself (there have been countless therapy sessions and a few medications",
    "I am so mentally and physically tired. I don't know what to do except cry because I just woke up and realized how fucked up this whole situation is. I haven't slept in 20 hours. I have absolutely no energy to do anything. I don't feel like myself. I don't know what to do or how to make it any better. I don't know who to turn to for support and who will blame me. I don't feel safe to even talk to anyone. I don't know what to say to my parents. I don't know how to explain this experience to them without sounding like a crazy person. I am crying like a child. I hope and pray that this doesn't get any worse so I can go back to sleep. I am too upset to write at the moment, but I will be back to do this in a matter of hours. I am so sorry to anyone with any experience like this. I am so grateful to have this community of supportive people here.\n\nA lot of things have happened since the \"Mental Illness & Suicide\" article was posted. The author, Alyssa, has received both positive and negative responses from readers. The following is a small sampling of comments; all are quoted verbatim directly from the Reddit threads.\n\nI had no idea what the hell was wrong with her until I came here to read the thread with this story. I have a sister who is also dealing with problems similar to hers. When she first found out she could walk and talk, she was terrified to even look at her new legs. I'm glad a lot of people here have had more successful outcomes than she has...\n\nWe are all suffering in many ways. I find this article fascinating; it just confirms what I know personally.\n\nMy wife and I had a difficult pregnancy, and I've put myself through an extensive amount of pain; this will be my biggest accomplishment because I did it in spite of all the \"craziness.\"\n\nI have been battling a mental health condition for 2 years. I have found the good side of everyone around me. There are no easy answers to this disorder -- in fact, I have learned the hard way...",
    "To: all users (not just this one) on /r/science and /r/metaphysics I'm writing today to explain why it seems like everyone on here has so many different sets of ideas about what science is, or isn?t. This happens because it appears that you share some common values — for example, you believe certain things like evolution shouldn't be taught in schools and religion should be completely divorced from public life — but yet you tend to have very different points of view when we talk about each other at great length. For those that think it's important for scientists to engage non-scientists in an exchange regarding these topics: please do, but only by making sure you really know who's talking before starting. That way whatever you decide will be a fair assessment of the issues being discussed. For those who are not actively interested in having scientific discussions but want to participate anyway, or want to continue discussing with us in an intelligent form: thanks! Many of the core beliefs I subscribe to (creationism, atheism, global warming denial, etc.) are not necessarily shared among my co-creators, and are instead held by a much smaller minority (which is fine). If anything though, our differences highlight how important it is to discuss in science the different worldviews people hold, both within that same group itself as well as between each other. Some readers may already feel a similar sense of unease regarding what they perceive to be another major bias on r/science — confirmation bias. Let me start with some general comments before going into more specifics. There is no single correct answer about nature vs. nurture, no matter which school of thought one goes to. And it can definitely be hard to understand for readers outside our community. Asking someone else to tell you what their personal experience has been may feel awkward or arrogant, since it has likely happened to them themselves or is close to home. On your website, you're given links to studies that show that there is \"clear evidence from across cultures showing … an innate tendency toward gender identification of individuals around 5 years of age,\" along with the advice that you find these effects replicated as much as possible. So I thought the best thing to do was to take the trouble to conduct an analysis myself and come up with new criteria to improve the quality of results and make the study consistent and comprehensive over time. My findings showed no changes in gender identity,",
    "I'm not going to lie, I've been thinking about this for a while now. I don't know if it's because I'm tired or what, but I feel like I need to write something down. I think that there are some things in life that we can do without having to be perfect. We can just try and make the best out of our situation. And I think that's all anyone really needs to say on the subject.\n\nSo here goes.\n\n1) Stop being so hard on yourself. You're doing fine. It's okay. There's no reason to beat yourself up over every little thing you don't get right. If you have any doubts at all, go ahead and ask them. But don't let those doubts keep you from enjoying your life.\n\n2) Don't compare yourself to others. This is one of my biggest pet peeves. People always seem to be comparing themselves to other people. They'll tell me how great they are compared to someone else, and then when I look at their profile picture, I see that person with a big smile and a ton of friends. That's not me. I'm not as good looking as that guy. I'm not as smart as that girl. I'm not as funny as that guy. I'm not as talented as that guy. I'm not as athletic as that guy. I'm not as intelligent as that guy. I'm not as creative as that guy. I'm not as skilled as that guy. I'm not as fast as that guy. I'm not as strong as that guy. I'm not as pretty as that guy. I'm not as rich as that guy. I'm not as popular as that guy. I'm not as successful as that guy. I'm not as healthy as that guy. I'm not as happy as that guy. I'm not as smart as that guy. I'm not as talented as that guy.

    "I'm not sure if this has been asked before, but I've noticed that there are some older games on Steam that have been removed or are no longer available for purchase. If you're looking to get into these games, here's what I recommend: 1) Go to the game page on steam and look at the top right corner of the screen. You should see a link called \"Games\" with a green arrow pointing down. Click it. 2) Look for the game in question. It may be listed under \"Other Games\". 3) Right click on the game and select \"Properties\". 4) In the window that opens, go to the \"BETAS\" tab. 5) Find the line that says \"This game uses an unsupported version of DirectX\". 6) Change the value from \"DX9\" to \"DX11\". 7) Save your changes. 8) Play the game!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to know more about how to play old PC games, check out our guide to playing old PC games on modern PCs.",
    "I was talking with someone recently about ideas and we came up on this idea you can read over here. It's really cool stuff that is based upon some science though, so I don't feel I'm just rehashing it.\n\n\nAnyway. This thread got me thinking about a couple other very real and important things in life. One being what your body is doing to you... The second was something very personal (but hopefully also relevant for those who suffer) I am having trouble sleeping. No matter how much I try my mind won't completely let go of what's going on inside of myself and when these thoughts are triggered they seem almost painful. It would be easy enough if there only were two days where it did bother me but sometimes both mornings AND nights and during late summer and into autumn are bad times for me. It doesn't go away at bedtime either until well past midnight or after 10-11pm (which has happened several times). As for why? Well I am usually quite active which is a major cause why. My days involve plenty to occupy most people. If even one day I get too tired and distracted then all of these mental activities need time to take place; which I now believe are happening.\n\nSo I have decided for the first time in 30+ years to see if certain supplements may help my insomnia. That includes anything that has caffeine listed.\n\nHere is the problem for many of us people who fall asleep fast without sleep; most of them actually end up tossing their pillows and pillow cases before they fall asleep again because they make them sleepy and they're tired. Or that annoying moment when we realize we accidentally left a phone charger on, thinking it'll be super easy to charge our favorite device or putter around when not needed! The same thing happens to you as you walk into Starbucks waiting for your morning coffee... and if your sleep pattern falls right into step with yours and you stay awake long enough to order yourself 2 lattes or cupcakes and no matter how great it goes, you're still gonna want to say \"Sorry we didn't know. Thanks for understanding\". Not surprisingly there are loads of articles out there explaining just exactly why and the symptoms often include not wanting to move or not feeling like moving. And then you get started on all kinds of prescription sedatives and anti apocalyptics as well, thinking that will finally get you back in",
    "I'm in a long-term relationship with someone who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, and we have been together for about two years now. We've had our ups and downs, but it's worked out pretty well so far. He's very intelligent, funny, and kind. He also has some social anxiety issues that he tries his best not to show. However, one day last week, while we were watching TV, he started getting really nervous and began pacing around the living room. When he got home, he told me that he was having trouble sleeping because he thought people were staring at him. He said that he felt like everyone was judging him, and that he didn't want anyone to know how much he hated himself. I asked if he wanted to talk about it, and he agreed. After talking for a few minutes, he came over to my place and sat down on my couch. He told me that he'd been thinking about suicide all night, and that he just couldn't take it anymore. He said that he knew he wasn't going to be able to handle life without being alone, and that he needed help. I tried to reassure him that there are plenty of other people out there who would love to spend time with him, but he insisted that he needed to do something about this. He then went into detail about what he was feeling, and how he felt like no one understood him or cared about him. He said that he felt like he was worthless, and that nobody would ever accept him as he is. He said that he was afraid that he wouldn't be able to live up to their expectations of him, and that he was scared that they would leave him. He said that he was worried that he might hurt himself, and that he was terrified that he might end up hurting others. He said that he was scared that he might never find someone who could understand him, and that he was scared that he might never get better. He said that he was scared that he might never be happy again. He said that he was scared that he might never be able to make friends again, and that he was scared that he might never be able to go back to school. He said that he was scared that he might never be able to function normally again. He said that he was scared that he might never be able to hold a job again",
    "\"My mom emailed me today after I posted yesterday. She seemed really pleased, and I told her, \"Mom, we have a new chapter to our relationship.\"\n\nShe replied, \"It's okay Mom. Thank you for sharing. I've been worrying about you.\"\n\nThat's pretty sweet, and I think I can feel my mom getting happier because of this decision: she sees her child grow, and understands that as an adult, she won't be bound by the past as much as she was. This is what really brings me down to Earth when people tell me I've changed just because I'm out. There is really nothing to change.\n\nStill, when I see people telling me, \"You've changed. You're a better person now,\" I want to tell them that's completely untrue, but you only grow in ways we can't see.\n\nI think we might have to accept that the first time we told most people about being gay, all the answers we sought were just as irrelevant to us as they were to our other sexual partners. At age 14, we told our friends. At age 22, we told anyone who would listen. We learned what to tell people, how to deal with people, how to be comfortable, our likes and dislikes, how to keep a job, what the risks are, how to tell our families that we were gay. I didn't even know that we could tell our families, so I asked friends for help. We learned all this stuff from friends, who we told on the phone or over Skype, and we learned it from strangers, our parents, our doctors. My mom and I both found out that our families were concerned about our safety — they told us we had no idea what we were doing. But we didn't need to know that just because my mom and I were out that we didn't have to be scared of coming out to the public.\n\nToday, my mom and I have a really good relationship. But it wasn't always this way. My mom would tell my sister and me that she did not want us to sleep with our boyfriends anymore, because she was scared of falling in love. My mother told me once that I was trying to get her out there with all the gay kids.",

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've had health anxiety for about 5 years now and it's gotten progressively worse over time. It started out as mild anxiety that would come on at random times during the day (like when I was driving or walking down the street) and then gradually got more intense until I couldn't even go to work anymore because I'd be so anxious. I tried everything under the sun, including medication, therapy, and diet changes, but nothing seemed to help. I eventually gave up trying to get better and just accepted that I was going to have to live with my condition forever.\n\nRecently, however, things have changed. My anxiety has become much less severe than it used to be, and I feel like I can finally start living life again. I don't know what happened, but something clicked recently and I decided to try to take control of my situation. I went online and found a few articles that talked about how people deal with anxiety and depression in general, and one of them mentioned the concept of \"panic attacks.\" I read through those articles and realized that they were exactly what I needed to overcome my current state of anxiety. So I did some research and came across an article by Dr. David Healy called \"How to Stop Panic Attacks\" which basically explained how to stop panic attacks. After reading his article, I felt like I could finally put my fear behind me and move forward with my life.\n\nSo here are the steps I took to stop my panic attacks:\n\n1. Get rid of all stressors in your environment. This includes anything you're doing right now, such as working, playing video games, watching TV, etc. If you find yourself getting stressed out while you're doing any of these activities, immediately stop whatever you're doing and do something else instead.\n\n2. Take a deep breath. Breathe deeply into your belly and hold it there for 3 seconds. Then exhale slowly through your nose. Repeat this process 10-15 times.\n\n3. Close your eyes. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. You should notice that your mind will begin to wander away from your worries and thoughts.\n\n4. Focus on your breathing. Now that you've focused on your breathing, you need to make sure that you continue focusing on it throughout the rest of the day. Don't let your",

    "In an effort to understand whether or not the majority culture would be compatible with ours, I am trying to collect some demographic data about those who would have previously considered themselves to be Syrian, (and especially people in Lebanon), but perhaps have now found out that they aren't really Syrians at all. As this is a small survey and may well reveal interesting answers; it also may give me some hints as far as what should we make of the situation surrounding those people, whose numbers I suspect will continue to rise exponentially if not dramatically (due partly to international and sectarian factors as discussed above). If anyone doesn't mind answering these questions anonymously please answer them without being too specific in any way other than to say which region you come from – for example \"I'm Jordanian.\" Please do NOT provide more than two details, including country etc. In particular it will be much better if only certain information provided as you feel comfortable doing so – I just thought that those were things most likely to help with clarity while thinking through the issues involved, rather than something like answering \"Is the entire world Israeli/Jewish\" to save space. Do not take my word on this stuff, go to your parents. Also do not take the following answers as gospel: No. They might seem to say yes. But that said it's really not clear where I stand. For instance, even if I did agree that the majority cultures seemed to generally get along with one another, does that mean that there's nothing wrong with Hezbollah bombing civilians in Syria? Does that mean we are free to bomb Assad (or Iranian troops…?), or any other regime for that matter, anywhere in the world? Again, I think its good idea to know when to stick your head in the sand (see below).\n\nOne comment left on Reddit by user \"C_J_H_R\" was particularly helpful:\n\nYou asked these questions of \"your\" countrymen. It makes it easy because your countrymen (mostly the young) don't care a ton anyway. They're probably wondering why they got their passports only a year ago. Then again, maybe a quick scan of the names from Lebanon/Syria on passport applications would inform them. A few guesses here but I'll try to stay outside of politics until the issue has fully been fleshed-out a bit: 1. Most people who get that new passport",
    "I started doing CrossFit in the fall of 2010 and the first time I started lifting weights it was only for an hour or so per week. After about a week I began getting frustrated with the level of difficulty that I was having in my programming, and decided to quit while I was ahead on my diet. I found myself overweight and hating everything about my appearance. I was constantly thinking about food and how to change it to make it taste better. I started gaining a huge amount of weight, I gained about 40 pounds from the first week of lifting, I was still not having any success maintaining my weight, and would lose a lot of weight even when I was on a binge eating spree. I knew I needed to lose enough weight to make a difference in my overall health, but I also knew I would lose it a lot faster if I started to eat more and weight gain would definitely accelerate with that. I didn't want to end up like my friends, overweight men who can not lose weight and they think it's because they didn't train enough or exercise enough and lose all their friends and their beautiful bodies. I would never want to be that kind of a person. Once I started losing a lot of weight, my diet was much improved because I was no longer craving junk food all time and I was exercising less, I never once had that horrible feeling of eating too much and getting the craving back. I felt great while I was losing the weight and I never felt like I couldn't lose any more… but I wasn't seeing the results I was counting on before. I also tried different supplements to try to boost my hunger and keep me feeling full longer, but honestly none of them helped at all. I went from 6% BF to 9% BF in 1 year and this was without taking any supplements. The main thing I feel is the difference in results was not from the program, but from changing the way I ate. I now eat 5 times a day which has made all the difference. Before before I would eat 3 meals during my meals, but now I eat only one meal and that meal is a big meal of protein and some carbs and fats. It's been helping my body the most with being leaner even though I'm still losing weight. There is so much food in each meal now that I don't feel hungry even though I'm already full and I feel like I have more",

    "\"I'm not a mom, but I know my daughter better than anyone else. As people keep on telling me she has mental health problems (which I agree to an extent), it's made us all a little more aware of this very important topic. This past year we started her on medicine to treat a skin condition and she is finally being taken off it (to our surprise) because she isn't making the progression as expected with the meds. She is now trying to stop taking them at the same time every day so that by next year they're really not affecting her in any way – we're nervous about going to school, but we want everyone to know where we stand. We've shared these concerns repeatedly with teachers or other staff members. There have been a few times when they've asked if she thinks she needs medication for something and after looking into it and learning more about how this works she said yes, but most often she says yes to avoid punishment/bullying from doctors! It can certainly get uncomfortable sometimes but the only thing worse would be getting home after school and hearing that her teachers didn't believe what her parents told him and let things get even harder.\n\n\nMost kids are like this before we got married, we had the same issues and we were able to work through everything together. The biggest problem for us now besides fighting in a huge amount (a number we share which may seem high since we're both working 9-5 jobs but we barely live paycheck to paycheck) is that both of us don't look out for each others' best interests. For example she will eat lunch while watching Netflix until she reaches dinner. Or if I was tired or stressed my husband doesn't come home and get rid of the dishes because he wants to watch his favorite show, so i pick up. That sort of behavior seems odd to you but it makes no sense considering I'm already doing things such as washing clothes etc even though my husband wouldn't allow it (he does get mad at me for not tidying up sheets after bed time.) You see it happens in other households too! What do I have to worry about? All I can say when people make those comments though is \"please understand there's no reason your opinion should matter because I will speak for myself!\" Just tell my parents to put on some clothes and leave their house, ok lol.

    "When I started playing video games, it was always multiplayer. In a way, I still am playing multiplayer today, and I find it very entertaining to have a competitive multiplayer game in which I can be challenged to beat a set of levels in a short amount of time, with the goal being to get all the medals. And when I get back home the next day, I feel like I accomplished something. The reward system for completing a set of levels, a certain type of medal achievement or just general challenge is just a huge incentive for me to try and keep playing. Yet for many, video games are primarily solitary, and single player titles are all boring.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. A recent Pew Research study found that the average video game player is 24-24-years old, married, with a spouse, and has children. You know, just like you!\n\nFurthermore, the majority of video game players were aged 18 to 29-years old (the average age was 26). The study found that almost half of them were unmarried or living with their parents. Additionally, they cited a \"bolder approach to gameplay\" as a key benefit of these older gamers.\n\nWe certainly appreciate and commend you. And we hope that you continue to enjoy gaming as much as you've enjoyed coming together online to challenge your gaming skills and share memories.",
    "I'm a mother of two boys, ages 11 and 7. I've been married for almost 10 years now. My husband and I have always had a very open relationship with our children.

Our marriage has never been perfect, but it's worked out well enough that we don't feel like we need to hide anything from each other or our children.\n\nMy oldest son was diagnosed with autism at age 3. He's been on Ritalin since he was 2, and his behavior has improved dramatically over the past few years. He's still pretty much an asshole, but he's also got some good things going for him. He's doing better than most autistic people do when they get older, and he's getting into sports and reading books again. He's also starting to play video games again.\n\nHe's also started acting more like a typical boy. He likes playing with Barbies and trucks, and he's gotten really into superheroes lately. He's even taken up painting. It's nice to be able to show him these things without worrying about how he'll react.\n\nBut there's one thing that bothers me. Last week, while watching TV, he asked if he could go outside and play. I said sure, and then he went outside and played for a bit. When he came back inside, he told me that he wanted to go outside again. I said okay, and then he did. And then he asked me if he could go outside again. I said sure, and then he went outside again. This time, he didn't want to come back inside. He just sat down on the couch and stared off into space.\n\nWhen I asked what was wrong, he said that he felt bad because he'd done something bad. But he couldn't explain why. So I tried to figure it out. I asked him what he thought would happen if he stayed inside all day.

    "You can tell that this show is super ambitious for its time, if everything about \"Doomed\" sounds like it were pulled straight out of his own head, that's because it basically is. There are several story threads here running simultaneously and things do not quite add up. The episode of \"Doomed\" where we meet Superman appears to have been reined in as of now because he was able to explain Superman's motivation pretty well at the end. Supergirl has been brought into an alliance with Doom, but she seems to get caught up in her own struggle in an almost forced love triangle with Lex Luthor/Gotham City mayor Gregor Glau who doesn't seem so smart for his age. In \"The Return\" part one, they fight Superman again. This time the entire Bat family, including Jason Todd, come to help him and you can hear some more back-and-forth banter between them than there usually would be. It also looks like Deathstroke might reappear in an important way (more on that after \"Invasion\") to make up for what he had screwed up earlier? All my theory-spurring questions aside, I think we're going to end up in a place we've never gone before where these three main characters find out who their parents really are…and are confronted by many other very unusual allies! Plus they have SUPERMAN hanging around the ship and you know that if it gets too much he'd prefer to just say 'goodbye' and roll away rather than risk letting people see him in an altered state. Can they turn all of these disparate issues to each other by the end of the season?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's worth noting that there are two versions of \"Invasion!\" where Brainiac arrives early and wreaks havoc when Superman tries to stop his plan during \"Allied Worlds,\" which could imply a crossover event (I suspect it will occur later), although it isn't exactly clear if any of our beloved Man Of Steel will actually survive this time. With that said...\n\nThe second part of the above post has the best summation. A big thanks goes to user Lornaric for spotting this little tidbit.",

    "I've been taking MDMA for about two years now, and I'm pretty sure that it's one of the most important things I've ever done in my life. It has helped me to heal from many traumas, including childhood sexual abuse, physical and emotional abuse, and even some PTSD. But there are times when I feel like I can't get out of bed because I don't want to face what happened. I have trouble trusting people, and I often find myself avoiding situations where I might be vulnerable or exposed. I also struggle with depression and anxiety, which makes it hard to function at work or school. I've tried therapy, medication, and self-help books, but nothing seems to help. I know that I need to do something more than just take MDMA once every few months. What should I do?\n\nThank you so much for your time!\n\nThis is an incredibly difficult question to answer, as it involves a lot of personal experience and interpretation. However, I think we all have a sense of what it feels like to be dissociated from our own experiences, and this is probably why MDMA is such a powerful tool for helping us to process past traumas.\n\nWhen we're dissociating from our own experiences, we're not really experiencing them directly; instead, we're filtering them through our own mental filters. This means that we're not actually seeing the world as it is, but rather as we wish it were. We're not really feeling anything, but rather projecting our feelings onto the external world. And while these projections may seem real, they aren't necessarily accurate representations of reality. For example, if someone tells you that they saw a car crash on their way home from work, you wouldn't see it as a car accident—you'd see it as a sign that they had a bad day. If you're dissociating from your own experiences, then you're not really experiencing them at all. Instead, you're filtering them through your own mental filters.\n\nSo how does this relate to MDMA? Well, let's say that you're having a particularly rough day at work. You're exhausted, stressed, and angry. Your boss calls you into his office and says that he needs to talk to you about your performance. He asks you to come in right away, and you start crying. When you arrive,",

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've had it for about two years now and have never really talked about it publicly. It's something that happens when you're around people who are socially awkward or just don't know how to interact with others. For me, it's usually someone who doesn't like to be touched (or at least doesn't want to be touched) and they'll try to avoid eye contact. They'll also often make faces or gestures that seem uncomfortable or weird. Sometimes they'll even look away or pretend to be busy. This can happen anywhere, but it seems to be more common in groups where there aren't many other people around. The person will then start talking to themselves and trying to act normal. Eventually, they'll get frustrated and say something along the lines of \"I can't talk right now.\" Then they'll go back to being awkward.\n\nIt's hard to describe what it feels like to be physically unable to speak in public. You feel like you're missing out on everything because everyone else is able to communicate. But you also feel like you're missing out on so much more than that. When you're unable to speak, you miss out on all the fun things that come with having friends over. You miss out on the opportunity to hang out with your friends, to watch movies together, to play video games together, etc. And you miss out on the chance to meet new people.\n\nWhen you're unable to speak, you miss out on all the fun things that come with having friends over.

    "I'm living in a small, tight-knit circle of friends and family. We're basically all very old people on the Autism spectrum. I work at my local school, and my sister makes crafts for the children on our block. We all work extremely hard in everything we do. Our family has lived in this house for at least a dozen generations. We can tell the difference between different breeds by the colour of their fur!

It's always someone upset at the cost of my dogs' food, their waste, or their general behavior.\n\nYou can be the cruelest thing to a person with autism simply by refusing to allow them – because they can't be there – to make something that's very personal and specific work. They can't understand the struggle of being in a house full of people, not being able to give their animals away where they feel safe, and needing to constantly be aware of who is around them in order to protect themselves. Most of us have the experience of seeing a neighbor or family members break their rule, only to watch the person go on to have a great life and raise multiple children without such concerns. I can't imagine what it's like when you're the one breaking the rule, and you don't realize it until someone else makes you, and everyone around you, worry about your safety.\n\nI hate the fact that my parents constantly remind me they shouldn't bring the dogs to work because they keep getting so many calls from people who are angry that they're going to school and not being their dogs. The dogs don't really complain about anything other than that, so I just let it go. My siblings and their parents aren't allowed to bring their animals either, which is frustrating to say the least, but I guess that's the price you pay for being living with one of the rare types of people that are allowed into this house.",
    "Translation: So, it's my 1st time posting on this forum, and I'd just like to clarify that I'm English, and I don't speak Turkish. I'm a student from London studying Physics, however I am studying a degree in Islamic Studies at a British university. I came here to get a bit of inspiration to do something and I'm not quite sure what it is, but I had several questions: The question I'm always asked is \"Does the Quran contain mistakes?\" My response is that it definitely did, and I will only go by the Quran and the Holy Sunnah. The Sunnah of the Prophets has not changed much since the time of the Prophet and his Companions. My first point is that the wording in a Noble Verse does not always mean the same thing to everybody. There are certain details that the Prophet may have interpreted differently. But the general idea behind both interpretations is the same - which is that the Quran is the ultimate authority. The difference is that we don't know the details, but we do know that the Quran is the truth, the last testament of God. It is also an example of how not everyone has to think in the same way as the Holy Prophet. A more exact example is a \"clear\" reading of the Noble Verses, but not an exact translation. The latter can mean many things and may not have the same meaning to everyone. I'll just be using the Quran or Sunnah to make my point. Please keep an open mind until the end of what I'm saying.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe translation of the word \"mistakes\" that your post presents is \"omwah\" (and I'm not sure if it is pronounced \"omwe\" as shown in the screenshot, but \"omwah\" is the correct translation). The word is taken from the Arabic-English lexicon, and is used a couple of times in the Qur'an.\n\nImam Bayhaqi's commentary (p. 5) says \"Omnwe (Omwah) is the term applied to two different but related concepts, as will be set forth later.\" The first definition (which is what I'm basing this post on). Here we can see the three basic meanings of omwah. But I don't think that these terms actually have a clear and consistent meaning.",
    "Hello. I'm the author of this piece and want to explain that it was actually never intended for this particular friend of mine. I've known her for a few years and as you probably know, I'm a fairly vocal supporter of psychiatry in general, in particular psychiatry's use of psychotropics on the mentally ill. Basically, this is why I was so upset to see that her friend was posting my pieces on reddit's psychiatry sub on her thread titled \"I've had it with depression.\" She found my article on bipolar and BPD and thought it might relate to her friend.\n\nThe topic is a very important one to me as I've personally experienced both and have been in therapy for depression since I was twelve. I was in therapy for about 18 months and it was a great start. But I'm going to try to shed a little light on my own experience and why I think it was such a mistake for her to post it on such a controversial thread.\n\nI know I sound like I'm complaining or fighting the establishment or the system but I have to share this because it's so much of what I've learned. And I believe that everyone reading this might learn something and if you're depressed, you might feel a little less alone on this planet.\n\nI was raised by an alcoholic and borderline-dependent parent who had always lied to me about what he was dealing with. He would lie or be dishonest about things for various \"motivational\" reasons but I've also always known he was a borderline-bipolar when he was off his meds. He could be very charming and persuasive, like when he would put me down and make me think that his family was not just \"bad\" but also \"evil.\"\n\nSo yeah, I have this knowledge of BPD right at this point. And I don't know a lot about psychotropic drugs I think it's time for us to do our own research into it because I don't want to be one of those who says, \"I have this knowledge and I'm not worried about it.\"\n\nI've been on psychotropic drug for a long time, maybe 25 years or so now. I'm a major heavy user now – I can't stop taking them because there's so much improvement to be had. The improvement is incredible. I'm still very much dependent though, both",
    "Hi! I am using the official C++ templates and libraries provided by Microsoft, especially for my project, because this is how we do things here in my university (a lot of people also use C). The template language has been around for decades now, so they seem to know what they are doing, and there was one particular problem that cropped up recently when using them with a different code base: What would you say to those folks who tell me: \"but the above mentioned templates were supposed to be backward compatible\"?\n\n\nI don't really get it, why would Microsoft take such pains to make sure these templates were backwards-compatible? Is it some sort of marketing plan to let you use newer versions but not older? Or did you decide that it's OK to leave it backwards-compatible because it will eventually become an impossible task (because there won't be anything faster than its predecessors)?\n\nWe have discussed this several times back and forth on Stack Overflow. Here is the relevant part of our discussion: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/428925/is-there-any-reason-to-keep-stdlib-backwards-compatible So now that we're on some form of parity between Standard Template Library 5.1 (the next version) vs ST3.2, why would it even be possible to continue supporting STL in Windows 8? Why doesn't Microsoft just change all the headers back into STL from STL 3.0/5.1 and then call it a day?\n\nThanks.",
    "I am using an HP laptop with a 15 inch screen and one i7, which costs me about $800 after sales tax. I've decided to downgrade to 32bit OS and stick with WiFi only since no cell phone service works from my house. However it has been getting better as wifi is often very spotty. The problem I have is that when trying to use cellular data I get a $21 charge for it after 6 bars, which was what the Apple description said to expect (although my provider didn't even provide that information). When I go into the settings app to change these percentages, it displays NO DATA! What should happen is if there are enough bars available, there would be an icon with 8 bars, then 12 bars at 11 o'clock, etc... Once it reaches 0 bars, it would continue showing this '$23,000 unused cellular data' amount, without changing it for the rest of my billing cycle. I am looking more closely to see what exactly is happening here. Is that standard? Is the system really supposed to just automatically allocate those charges according to its internal calculations? Also, what would I need to do in order to prevent such overages, or do I have it \"wrong\"? Thanks in advance!",
    "As we approach Saturday, July 29th, 2013 our community as well as the larger esports scene here in Mexico continue to thrive and grow. In many ways it's been an amazing year so far. On top of the fact that we are celebrating this event with three great events over the course of the next few weeks - one after another for each day leading up to the date, there have been some incredible contests and competitions throughout 2013. Amongst all of these great things, one game stands out amongst the rest, however due to the nature of how online play works today I won't be able to reveal its name until the last minute! If you look through the official rules, a very interesting section on the topic of player accounts states: \"Players must create an account prior to tournament participation (either to avoid potential cheating of other players or by using their real social identity). Players may not use any false names at any time during the competition\". So what is a false alias? The article doesn't say. However the second sentence (my bold): \"...must utilize their real social identity\". This could refer to having a different passport number than your main account or having no legal identity whatsoever with whom can make a new character for online play. While this wording means a couple of things really quickly - first of all all everyone knows what we mean when we mention true alias! That is where a person will get an IP Address at which point we can do some basic digging. Looking at this information, only two games on my list above require you create multiple characters so this would actually go a long way into proving that the rule in question simply requires us to provide our real life address along with creating a fictitious id. What of the others though? Surely there has to be some loophole to allow a character on my list to appear while also being a fake one if someone wants to create a fictional identity online? Well no, and not exactly. My research leads me down a path which involves the following situation: Suppose somebody creates an alternate identity somewhere along its path to success to become a pro gamer, then comes out publicly claiming to be the real self. Assuming he plays his authentic character with all of the skill and knowledge, does his secret character end up becoming more successful and popular through sheer force? Would you still call them a competitor for the real and live persona even if they haven't performed on live stream anymore",

    "Rating\n\n[out of five stars]\n\n\nDirector Danny Boyle directs, stars and edits this masterpiece; Irish actress Ewan McGregor makes many great performances; and there are a few minor surprises during an absorbing journey about how drugs change people through addiction to their surroundings. [SIGNS: This is in no way related/associating with \"Trainspotting\"] * * ** There was great interest when I first watched Tim Roth as Ian in The Wolf of Wallstreet, but that wasn't the same experience when he returned for Trainspotting. In that case it was all in the story, the relationships between Ian (Ewen MacColl) and his two lovers, Begbie (McGregor) and Sammy (Robert Carlyle), and how those three came to be involved with each other. On average the entire relationship felt like it was real and moving, instead it was merely told, something that works only while we're waiting for something dramatic (and unexpected). And at times, there simply isn't enough drama, though at least at some points there's tension and a few scenes have plenty of action and fight sequences. But for the most part this could easily have been another slow-paced crime movie filled with long scenes taking place within London alone or waiting around near an airport. Instead the film is more focused on these 3 characters than it was on making sure you got the right feeling out of them on the outside. When you look back over these past 25 years, you find a remarkable list of incredible talents from Ireland; including Michael Hegarty (\"Teddy Bear\", \"A Man and His Dreams\"), Brendan Gleeson (\"Hulk,\" \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\"), Jim Broadbent (\"Barry Lyndon\") and even Jamie Dornan ('Star Wars'). All four actors contribute and bring their unique style to the roles with varied talent, yet their dialogue remains simple and often funny. Even the best comedic actors can only take you so far once more interesting stories and ideas begin to unfold, and director Danny Boyle does excellent work developing the story by showing who is in control and why. Boyle has given us one of film history's greatest movies -- in fact Trainspotting may not live up there as well as its predecessor; but it would hardly be worthy without its incredible cast. * * **\n\n\"Trainspotting\" seems appropriate because",
    "(Spoilers) In this new version, with director Robert Rodriguez being replaced by David Ayer of Suicide Squad, the plot doesn't change much but there are some minor shifts of events which might be more memorable for the audience. More importantly, it's all about one of those people you know and love as that person would have been alive today and not really knowing them anymore… What I didn't like is how they kept using other actors' face on their character without mentioning the fact about who the other actor was just to provide contrast and make it even crazier… This feels like some low-budget shit where they're trying to push the technology out there instead of taking advantage of its possibilities. The movie plays fast (and fun), yet there isn't enough substance (for me this is also a good sign). As mentioned before, these aren't the only horror themes we're dealing with in this one; other things are being covered too such as mental illness and family dynamics, etc. Overall the whole \"horror style\" thing has its roots here. It's not a lot of scares here although there will be plenty of blood which will get your adrenaline pumping along the way. The atmosphere inside the asylum should have been darker than in some of Rodriguez's earlier films including Sin City which had a similar feel to this one. Other reviewers pointed out that Rodriguez changed the tone of the action scenes since he's supposed to focus on the psycho killer theme throughout most of his new film! It's definitely a better experience overall but it still falls to my two cents/comment because when you see what you thought were going to be scary things turn out to be easy, mindless thrills.\n\nI hope everyone gives this a watch so we can collectively learn something from it because sometimes in life there comes moments that could lead us into further thoughts we may not necessarily agree with and if we do then unfortunately this type of movie makes us think again. Maybe someone else won't agree with me but this probably made me think about other things so hopefully now I'll be willing to consider the movie to be worthwhile when I see its eventual release later tonight or tomorrow…",

    "Directed by James Gunn\n\nWritten by Nicole Perlman, Nicole Perlman, James Gunn\n\nStarring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel\n\nReleased May 5, 2017\n\nThere are few things Marvel fans can look forward to in life more than the release of another Captain America film, or, indeed, a third Captain America film. So we've not been too disappointed with the Marvel films from so far. Most of our time spent in the real world watching them has been on the small screen, usually on BBC. The latest Captain America movie (the third iteration) was actually better than the first two. Still, even for the great Iron Man, it is a bit of a letdown to have to wait another year for another solo caped crusader epic, which at times it feels like we've been waiting for. For a while it seemed as if Marvel was going to take a break and start looking at other films like DC's universe. Then, they put it back on the table, as if it had never been in the first place! Finally we get a Captain America movie with a great cast, and it is even better than any of the previous ones in my opinion. I'm really excited to see what they come up with next, and I'm hoping for the best. The previous Cap films had the right balance between action and comedy, and this movie has the perfect balance between both. From our MCU review:\n\n\"With a strong solo outing in \"Guardians 3\" and a solid and entertaining ensemble follow-up \"Guardians of the Galaxy (2017)\", Marvel Studios has demonstrated it can find a satisfying balance between their big-screen Avengers universe and the shared universe of DC's super heroes. At the same time, however, director James Gunn has shown he can craft a film that has comic book charm but just as much heart, with no obvious Marvel weaknesses (outside of some characters becoming the focus of a third film series). \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" is a return to form for the MCU. It's no Wonder Woman, but Gunn has added a lot, making the film more cohesive than the first and more like the previous two installments. This movie is filled with humor and action and an intriguing villain. The film is definitely worth checking out, even though the plot doesn",
    "In 1979, The New York Times devoted over eight pages to Roger Espinosa's original Alien script, and this much we know: he wanted to make Space Jockey 2, and he intended on using Sigourney Weaver in it; that he liked the concept; but that he was not involved on a regular basis anymore after writer Walter Hill (Dazed And Confused) left. A week later, Hill died. It was around then that The Post began running articles about how big James Cameron's influence became, with an emphasis on his direct involvement with the first two Alien sequels. By 1982, The Huffington Post ran a story saying \"James Cameron had made over six million dollars in salary for himself writing Aliens,\" which seemed ridiculous at first blush given that, despite all their initial appearances, none of them were produced commercially. However, according to multiple reviews since then, those who knew or were part of Ridley Scott planning efforts say that, yes, Cameron did not write all the sequels—or even much of what got made. At least one person claims to have known personally who wrote Aliens 3, Alien 3: Hell Comes To Frogtown, etc.—the legendary David Giler —and the credits said differently than anyone claimed, including when Ridley Scott eventually talked about it with a group including Peter Jackson and Gary Sinise. What exactly happened? When I went back through my notes for an old article covering Prometheus three years ago, all there was is confirmation that Cameron didn't direct Aliens 4 and 5. That doesn't mean that he wasn't involved or even involved enough, as mentioned by some people who actually worked with him on the script in the 1980s. But then there are lots of other theories about whether or not he really had no idea. Here are five. 1. John Logan Didn't Write Aliens Anymore, Except In A Very Generic Sort Of Way It appears likely that Cameron will be blamed for any failures in the second trilogy, particularly the less popular ones like Alien III (1997). He says explicitly in Prometheus that the series does belong to him now; but his last major project before making Avatar was 2002's Blade Runner 2049. So there definitely would be strong pressure on him to stick close to his roots if he wants a sequel that audiences won't remember the name of and are generally unlikely to want. For that matter, the idea that a studio executive could ever refuse that kind of money again shows you just",
    "\"This is a film that has been in development hell since its inception, and it's finally getting to the point where it can be released. It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good.\"\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I think this is one of the best movies ever made. The story is simple enough – a young girl (played by Meryl Streep) moves into her father's house with her mother (played by Julia Roberts). She meets an older man (played by Ben Stiller), who she falls head over heels for. Things get complicated when he starts dating her mom.\n\nIt's a very sweet story, and it's easy to see why people would want to see it. But there are some problems with the movie. For starters, the acting is terrible. There are several scenes where you just don't know what's happening. And then there's the fact that the plot is so convoluted that it makes no sense at all.\n\nBut let's start with the positives. This is a great looking movie. The cinematography is beautiful, and the music is catchy as hell. The performances are also top notch. Streep does a fantastic job playing the role of Mamma Mia, and Roberts gives a wonderful performance as her mother.\n\nThere are two things that really stand out about this movie. First off, the song \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" is absolutely amazing. It's got a great beat, and it's catchy as hell. Second, the ending. It's a bit cheesy, but it works.\n\nOverall, I give \"Mamma Mia!\" a B+\n\nAdvertisements",
    "IMDB Rating: 4 Out of 5 stars\n\n\n(Updated on 03/14/15) One thing I really enjoyed about this film was that it allowed Robert Downey Jr. to play Iron Man all in one take (something which he only did with two other characters before). Although the special effects were just barely there for much of the film's running time, most scenes where Downey's Tony Stark appeared looked rather impressive and were worth the price of admission alone. As another Iron Man fan noted in the comments below, however...I think I will leave my Marvel DVD set to my teenage daughter (she can appreciate it), as she'd definitely be annoyed by it at times if I let her watch it! It may be unfair to say so since that particular disc has no action - only the character stuff - but I am looking forward to watching the rest when it becomes available digitally.

    "After an unplanned pregnancy, Amy (Rose Byrne) decides to follow up on her marriage proposal and get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. Along with husband Nick (Adam Scott), wife Jen (Zoe Saldana) and their daughter Liv (José Ferrer), she learns that a group of wealthy investors wants to fund a \"bioethical\" clinic that would investigate the ethics of reproduction. She also discovers something else when he has sex with one of his clients — the woman's eggs are deformed. When they're successfully implanted into a surrogate later in the film, however, her fetus turns out to be more biologically typical than any other.\n\nTo read the complete review you can click here.",
    "This film, directed by David Fincher (Fight Club), is about two lovers who meet on an airplane and fall in love. The story follows their relationship as they travel to London where they are married. It's not exactly Shakespearean but it does have some great performances. I'm not sure if this will be a good or bad thing.\n\nI think that this is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again because it has so much going on. There are many different characters and there are many different scenes. This movie is very well acted and written. The acting is top notch. The writing is also top notch. The plot is interesting and the ending is unexpected.\n\nThere are several scenes that are just amazing. One scene in particular was when the couple is sitting at the bar and the bartender asks them what they want to drink. They say they don't know. He says he'll make something up. Then he makes up a drink called \"the blackberry martini.\" That's pretty awesome.\n\nAnother scene that really stood out to me was when the couple is walking down the street and they see a man with his arm around another woman. The guy looks like he's having sex with her. The girl turns around and sees him too. She walks away and then comes back and tells the guy she doesn't want to talk to him anymore. The guy gets mad and starts yelling at her. Then the girl runs off crying.\n\nOverall, this movie is definitely worth watching. It's got lots of action and it's got a lot of heart. If you're looking for a romantic comedy, this might be your movie.",
    "This time around, we're treated to an even more ridiculous plot involving a bunch of drunken idiots and their crazy antics. The film's main character (played by Ed Helms) has been hired as a personal assistant to a wealthy businessman who happens to be a former CIA agent. He's also married with two kids, so he's not exactly in the best position when it comes to dealing with his boss' wife. But that doesn't stop him from trying to get her to have sex with him! It's all very funny, but I can't help but feel like this was just another way to make money off of the \"Hangover\" franchise.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty of people out there who will disagree with me on this one, but I think the fact that this movie was made at all is pretty much proof that Hollywood is still stuck in its old ways. Sure, they've gotten better over the years, but they haven't really changed much since the days of \"The Godfather.\" And if you want to see how far they've come, check out the new \"Star Wars\" movies. They're actually pretty good.",
    "This film has been compared to \"The Exorcist\", but I think it's more like \"The Omen\". It's not as scary, and there are some scenes that are just plain weird. But if you're looking for an action-packed horror flick with lots of blood and guts, this one will do the trick. The story follows a group of soldiers who have been sent on a mission to investigate a mysterious outbreak in the military base they've been assigned to protect. They soon find themselves trapped inside a hellish nightmare where they must fight off hordes of demons while trying to survive. This is a great example of how to make a good horror movie. There are plenty of jump scares, and the gore is well done. The only problem is that the characters don't seem very real at all. They're just cardboard cutouts. And the ending is pretty much a waste of time. If you want something that will scare the crap out of you, then look no further than Army of Darkness.\n\nI'm going to give this movie 3 stars because it does have its moments. However, it doesn't really stand up to the standards set by other films such as \"The Exorcist\" or \"Nightmare On Elm Street.\"",
    "This film has been described as an action-adventure comedy, but it's more like a superhero movie with a heavy dose of slapstick and humor. The story follows Megamind (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson), who is a superpowered being that can transform into any animal he desires. He lives in a city called Metropolis where he works as a bounty hunter. One day, he encounters a young boy named Maximus (played by Jason Lee) who is also a super powered being. They become friends and they decide to team up to take down a criminal organization known as the Syndicate. This group of criminals are responsible for kidnapping children and selling them off as slaves. When Megamind transforms into a tiger, Maximus becomes a dog. When they go on a mission together, they discover that their powers aren't quite what they seem.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing. I think it's a little bit of both. On one hand, it's funny because you're watching two characters who have no idea how powerful they really are. It's also kind of silly because there's so much slapstick involved. But then again, it's pretty entertaining. There's some great fight scenes and some great comedic moments. If you're looking for something lighthearted, this might be your ticket.\n\nIf you want to see the trailer for \"Megamind,\" click here.",

Along the way, Kevin encounters many other characters including his neighbor's son, his sister-in-law, his boss, his girlfriend, his brother, his cousin, his dog, his neighbors' dogs, and more. This film is filled with humor, heartbreak, and plenty of action. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, action, or just plain fun!",
    "This film is an interesting one, and I'm not sure if it's worth watching. It has some good ideas, but they are all overshadowed by its poor execution. The story is told in flashbacks, which makes it difficult to follow along with the plot. There are also many scenes that seem to be cut out or altered at random. This leads to a lot of confusion as you try to figure out what happened in each scene. Also, there are several scenes where the characters talk about things that don't happen in the actual movie. For example, when Alex (played by Anthony Burgess) talks about his father, he says something like \"I was never really interested in him.\" But then later on, we see that he actually killed his father. So why did he say this? And how does this relate to the main plot? These questions can only be answered through further viewing. Overall, this is a very strange film.\n\nIMDB Rating: 3/10",
    "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is set in Kazakhstan, home of the so-called Kazakh miracle: the oil boom and the country's remarkable level of modernization. At first glance, the film is not a typical documentary about contemporary politics in post-Soviet nations; instead, this comedy features the world of Borat, an Internet comedian whose comedy routines have been lampooned into an Internet hit that has been translated into over 50 languages. It follows in the tradition of Ivan the Terrible and Ivan the Terrible, the rulers of the Mongolian Empire. These stories explore politics of the Soviet Union, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Soviet Union, the collapse of communism, and the current climate of international relations.\n\nI know many of you are aware that Kazakhstan is a hotbed of anti-Semitism. But do you know about the anti-Semitism in other countries, like in India, Indonesia and elsewhere?\n\nBorat: Cultural Learnings is a comedy made for Internet viewing and will be in theaters in Kazakhstan in December 2014. According to the IMDb description, the movie features both the humor of Borat, and the political commentary of a group of foreign politicians involved in the current conflict in Ukraine.\n\nSo, I would like to begin by asking some questions to understand Borat:\n\n\n1. Did you see the movie \"Borat\"?\n\nYes, of course. Of course. I love his acting and his humor, and I love that I can go to any country in the world and see his comedy routines.\n\n2. Are you familiar with the recent anti-Semitism in Kazakhstan?\n\nI'm glad to be here. My friend has lived in Kazakhstan for a long time and we often discuss Jewish activities in Kazakhstan.\n\n3. Does the joke, \"A new word for anti-Semitism in Kazakhstan is: Borat,\" have any relevance to Kazakhstan's current crisis with the Russian Federation over Ukraine?\n\nI have nothing to add. I hope I will get a chance to talk about Kazakhstan's current situation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\n4. Are you familiar with anti-Semitism in India? (I did not read the script, but apparently Borat is a Jew in Kazakhstan?)",
    "[Burt] Loomis is both well known on this side of the Atlantic and beloved here in the States as one half of the comedy duo, the Loomis/Nakahara team who starred together in films such as \"Hannibal Rising,\" \"Loving Vincent,\" and \"The Dark Knight.\" This film seems to be an extended commentary upon that love affair, particularly that passion between a married couple (or 'pans') and one another which in certain moments becomes somewhat obsessive. However I've heard similar criticism about Lorman Hutz's classic American musical western 'Maiden' - not only was there too much going on around it, but its central premise seemed to have reached a kind of nihilistically end point.\n\nA similar message is also contained within director Quentin Tarantino's movies - notably his critically-acclaimed work ('Kill Bill'), the gritty crime fiction feature 'Django Unchained,' and now he's returned with 'Inglorious Bastards.' Like those other, more recent examples, we see our protagonist, Michael Caine, having something of an epiphany by way of events during what would otherwise become a routine day in the life of a soldier. His first order of business after returning home, where he encounters old lovers played by Sam Shepard and Joaquin Phoenix, soon turns into a massacre. The scenes are bloody, brutal, violent and thoroughly unpleasant. But despite all his faults and failings, and the fact that most people do seem to find him repellent simply because of the character's very existence, the effect of these sequences has been one thing that cannot be denied – they have created in themselves an atmosphere of dread, suspense and anxiety; at least, I hope that's how everyone feels when they watch them, whether one agrees with what they're seeing or not…\n\nAlthough there are no real surprises, nor surprise endings to be had, the final scenes contain the same kind of emotion which can only emerge through watching someone close like Caine go through the same ordeal he goes through. So perhaps as a result of the violence inflicted upon this man so often over his career, this may indeed have found favor with me. This should have nothing to do with the performances given by Michael Caine and Samuel Jackson who play their respective parts effectively each time out. They might never again act together, however, since Caine's star",
    "A train runs a little over three miles (four kilometers) from Seoul to Busan, but it will make a shorter trip for some of your colleagues in the movie, Train to Busan, now available on DVD for the first time in 13 years.\n\nK-Pop girl group Girls' Generation, led by singer and songwriter Jessica, is given a gift-wrapped train, loaded with the latest in technology as the newest member, Hani, meets it at The Seoul Metro. The other members and staff are skeptical at first, as the train is not on schedule but has a ticket, and there are a lot of people on the train, causing many to want to switch seats. But as Hani moves forward, she begins to understand the \"value\" of such a train with her special, unique set of abilities, a gift she brings along from her childhood in Japan. After the passengers get into the train, Hani explains further on the value of train travel as a way for people of all interests, talents and abilities to connect, to have fun and to have some fun together.\n\nThe film doesn't have a plot, but it's clear that the movie is all about people and their love and connection to the train, through the characters, who share their love for trains. The relationships of the main characters (Chaeyoo, Daehoon and Namjeong) and the staff members are more meaningful and more real, like in the movie, than in real life. There are scenes on the train with many emotions: a mother and daughter who are waiting for their train, couples, families, kids and friends. Some scenes are more dramatic, like a conversation between the conductor and a pregnant woman, and it's shown that many women like to have a train waiting for them at home to get them home quicker.\n\nThe characters are diverse and diverse, and the relationship between different characters from different age groups and culture is really moving. This includes the main Korean characters, although Chae Young-joon, also known throughout the world as Super Junior's Sulli, does have the advantage of being the youngest child in the movie.

    "Signs is a heartwarming tale of survival, and of a man's journey towards self-reliance under the worst odds. When the lights go out in a small town, a young man, who is about to begin his life as a father, awakens on a dark, rain covered highway. Alone. And with no food or water. This man, named Sam, spends several nights sitting on a roadside, hoping he'll be noticed, that people will stop. He eventually realizes, that people don't stop. And that is all that is left, before he dies of thirst.\n\nAs it was on this fateful road, Sam must fight his own battle against the elements, if he is to survive. On his own, he manages to find one of these 'cattle carriers', where the animals will eventually be taken to be used as food. He must also contend with the men who want to exploit them for their tusks, and the other animals who want to be left alone, including those who have been shot by men who want their tusks for their own. It's a harrowing film, and very impressive in the way that it moves through these difficult situations and in the way it portrays the hardship, the struggle to survive and the compassion of those who do not know what to do, and who must try to make the best out of a very bad situation. This is a very moving film which has an excellent story. Sam is very similar to the main character in many ways, and it is very nice to see him on screen, being courageous and believing.\n\nDirector Robert Redford did a pretty good job on this film. It is very different from his previous film \"The Old Man and the Gun\", and very much his \"The Insider\" films, especially in the way it does not try to \"out-Shakespeare\" Shakespeare, but the characters in \"Signs\" do not act like Shakespeare's characters. They are very different. And Sam is a very strong, noble character. He is not a one note, like in \"The Insider\". Instead, he is a bit off-the-wall, but with a lot of character. This is a well made story, with believable characters. Redford and his team really went all out of this film, and with \"Signs\", they gave the viewer the complete experience they hoped for, despite them working on the",
    "This must be the saddest picture I've seen all year. I can't believe this has earned $41M so far. That's about 30 times the amount (for that one) that it took for Ben Affleck to get his first Oscar nomination, despite him being nominated on the back of an even more ridiculous and controversial screenplay by another guy, Matt Damon. Let me tell you, I thought at some point that the original script would have been shelved because it was not, in fact, going anywhere. Now? No worries, they're just gonna add a bunch of stuff in, which will make it seem even better than the finished film. All right. So who wins at every turn? The script's a load of crap, but then so (as always) are most Hollywood scripts. But hey! It'll help bring attention to one of the best movies coming for us this Christmas…even if he's not in it anymore.\n\n\nThe main thing that needs fixing here – as noted earlier — is that Mr. Damon was never actually involved in any of the filmmaking process, hence the studio went with a non-actor — a certain Michael B Jordan — to play the character. They could easily go with a director/lead who worked closely (or even remotely), but instead opted to let them hire the least likable person available (but only after they had already spent millions getting him). There were dozens of directors and actors ready for the role. What were they doing there sitting on their hands while Mr. Damon made this mess? After watching the flick and seeing how much money it took to cast him, just imagine how much was spent elsewhere. The entire reason why no other actor besides Will Smith ever got a lead of any size was because they knew he'd be the best choice. Look what happened to those guys when they passed on this deal when Affleck was the only offer out there. Who knows with Matt Damon…he's obviously trying to do everything in his power NOT to look bad. It doesn't work. And the writing isn't very good either, although most of that could also be chalked up to him taking over for someone else and giving half-assed direction. I really hope they fix these technical shortcomings soon, otherwise, we might need to consider changing the name(s) on this reviewer's badge. I've gotten calls from agents everywhere lately who want to know whether or",
    "I love stories that allow me to connect with characters, and even though I am aware about how difficult it can be in fiction to get a hold of a real life person – you just never really feel right that those details do not belong, as if they are an idea or a character created by another author who has chosen to insert them into our world. Yet with Turkey (in all its shades of brown), a huge country and population within Europe's backyard, the movie 'The Ottoman Lieutenant' makes such attempt, allowing us, in the most simple of ways, see and experience different worlds through different eyes. It does this without a single word or thought being written or spoken, but thanks to some outstanding filming techniques and interesting actors. The film unfolds in 3 parts, each focusing on one or more countries of the Middle East/West Asia area and where some sort of conflict took place, especially during the time of Ottoman empire. The story revolves around three brothers who are the sons of a well-known merchant. One brother ends up in Vienna, Austria; the second gets married to Hungarian Queen Victoria & dies young – then suddenly he comes back on his own, and goes as far away as Egypt. Another remains in Istanbul, Turkey, and the final son is sent off to the sea in Constantinople, by way of Cyprus-Greece, the port for that era. Although having grown up seeing pictures on television, movies, and magazines depicting battles & wars taking place in Europe, Asia, North Africa, or even Russia, none of these memories have ever come true for the boys, until they decide to unite the continents together. In spite of their dreams, however, the brothers find themselves trapped with other refugees in Greece and Italy. This, after all, is what happens when governments fail a large number of people. Even so, the story makes clear, at least for my kids the next day – there will always be war amongst peoples. Sometimes they choose sides, sometimes others use force against them for some reason or other. And yes. We all knew who was fighting whom. But it did not matter enough, because you were always looking behind the scenes to make things happen. At least we learned in school that history had taught us those lessons the very first time, only to watch all over again. That's why that was so important in our mind, that we could actually learn something today rather than learning from somewhere",

While not as horrific as his last feature 'Cocaine Cowboys,' Dougherty manages to combine humor and gore throughout this low budget effort, delivering the kind of horror thriller that few will dare try out; I definitely recommend seeing it before you watch another director do it in a genre or even two decades later. Despite its somewhat ridiculous premise – a young woman (Kate Siegel) marries a famous writer (Gary Busey), who proceeds to abduct her daughters, while trying on different wives at home (each one being worse than the previous), only to have to kill all of them and throw each girl in some sort of coffin because they would eventually escape once she had left town? - it's still a scary film full of great acting and a killer soundtrack - especially if you are into creepy movies without gore. I'm glad I saw this despite my reservations about it. It would be great for anyone and everyone looking for something weird and crazy in a horror genre. A must see!\n*This was a DVD copy.",
    "A man named Thomas (Michael Smiley), who must be 25, is on his third week in an institution for the criminally insane after killing his sister's husband one morning with a hatchet. He soon gets out and witnesses a horrifying act of violence which will transform him into The Changeling — someone known as the changeling because he can't physically change his appearance. It seems that this new ability to affect others comes hand in hand with more frightening abilities to influence their minds. A very powerful demon named The Wyrm (William Hurt) comes after Thomas but when she attempts to kill Thomas, not only does the Changeling escape, but the two are then joined by Michael Noonan as he tries desperately to save both his brother and this innocent young girl from being transformed by the supernatural world. In many ways, the \"Changeling,\" Thomas, is like an anti-hero or at least somebody whose actions we can sympathize for. This film has some of the elements of a gory gore fest with very disturbing images and events where you fear for the lives of everyone involved until it ends with just a whimper rather than much suspense. However, we feel that it was well worth every minute just to watch our old friend Thomas take down a dragon without weapons. He also becomes an ally rather than simply a pawn in the game played against The Wyrm. The story begins shortly before the first scene begins to play, with the three characters attempting to find a way home from an unknown environment only to encounter The Strain (Robert Carlyle). Not knowing if they are human or otherwise, they stumble upon the secret world of \"The Stray.\" Thomas manages to overcome the danger, reunite with Eve and finally gain her trust to lead them back home when all seems lost. Although there were certain scenes which seemed out of place during the rest of the film (which is what most people might describe as \"unnecessary\") I felt they added flavor that made the actual content seem \"right.\" Overall, the pacing of the film did make itself clear with its release date. If your looking at buying the DVD version this is definately the one this time around to go along with the blu ray edition if/when released. And although this was a little cheesy, it would probably make a great bonus feature for those fans (like myself) that found themselves wanting additional footage on the DVD.",
    "Tangled is what your granddad would call a \"comprehensive fairy tale\". All these years later, there's still plenty of room left to go to town on the tale's charms. In the same vein, there's plenty of room left to fill in the details and fill out the characters so that it's not just another fairy tale. In particular, it would be nice to find a way to make our hero a little less \"the villain\".\n\n\nI'm still not even sure what the \"villain\" is supposed to be. Not to mention that by the time the film has completed with the main story, it also concludes it's \"Tower of Mistakes\" bit. I'll have to see the movie in a theater when I get in town, to see which point in its life the story is truly in - and maybe see if that makes it any less of a \"fairy tale\".\n\n\nEven though I didn't think there was any sense of urgency or urgency in this film, the first act and the story's conclusion is definitely intense and scary, which is always a plus when watching a slasher. If you liked the first \"Sin City\" or the first \"Scream\", you'll have something to like here, and if you haven't seen them, it's worth the time to check them out.\n\n\nOne major advantage of this film's slow pace is that not much happens in this film, which means it's able to focus on its characters and their developing situations. You don't have to have a clear idea in order to like this film, you just like to feel like you're in some strange, beautiful place. That's exactly how this film feels.\n\n\nA story with this kind of slow-burn can be made a little more effective by toning down all the violence to a minimum. Even though all the violence is present, the only time you really get to feel bad for something is when some poor guy is about to bleed out on some random hallway (and he does bleed out a lot). There's no great suspense in that. Plus, at least with this film I feel like I know who the main character is, which is a plus, if I don't mention the \"villain\" it could just be a character flaw (or lack of) or we should know nothing of it because we need to follow along with someone else",

    "Invictus follows the story of a retired U.S. Army veteran named Marcus, whose life is forever changed when he wakes up one day to find his ex-wife, her son, and his daughter are all dead. Now free from the constraints and burdens of modern life, Marcus sets out to find his long-lost son and daughter-in-law before he is forced to return to active duty and face justice—and his own fate.

    "Based on a bestselling novel by Dan Brown, this darkly comic film follows Nicky Parsons (Christian Bale), whose world and his family's world have been destroyed by a conspiracy he believes to be demonic in nature, bringing him to London where he finds himself battling a Satanic cult led by Professor John Dee (Ralph Fiennes). It seems as though an evil force that is deeply rooted in history may now be at work within our own time...and it is beginning to change our very ways. While it starts off more as a thriller with strong character moments, Brown pulls no punches when dealing with the events taking place during and around the opening scenes [of the film].",
    "This is one of those movies that you can't help but love, even if it's not your favorite Pixar film. It's got all the charm and heart of the first film, with some new twists on the formula. The story follows Woody (voiced by Buzz Lightyear) as he tries to find his way home after being lost in space for years. He meets up with Jessie (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), who has been living alone since her parents died when she was young. Together they set out to find their father, who has gone missing while searching for a mysterious object called the Key to Time. Along the way, they encounter many other characters, including Andy (voiced by Tim Allen), who wants to be friends with Woody, and the toys themselves, who are trying to figure out what happened to their creator. There are also plenty of jokes about how much money people make at the toy store. This movie is filled with great character moments, and the humor is just right. I'm sure there will be more sequels, so this should be fun to watch over and over again!\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.5/10",
    "This film is about a man who has been in prison for 20 years and is now released on parole, but he's not free yet. He's still living with his mother, who is trying to raise him as best she can while also dealing with her own problems. She's got a new boyfriend, a guy named John (played by Michael Caine), who seems like an okay guy until he starts talking about how much money he makes at work. The woman doesn't know what to think, so she asks her son if he knows anything about this. When he says no, she gets angry and tells him that he needs to get out of there before it's too late.\n\nSo he goes back to jail, where he meets another inmate named Tom (played by Robert De Niro). They become friends and they start hanging out together. One day, Tom comes up with a plan to escape. He wants to steal a car and drive it into the ocean. But first, he plans to kill his mom and then himself. So he takes off all his clothes and puts them in a bag. Then he sits down next to his mother and pulls out a gun. He shoots her in the head and then kills himself.\n\nNow, the police are looking for the car and Tom. They find it parked outside a house, which is owned by a couple named Mr. and Mrs. Smith (played by Dustin Hoffman and Diane Keaton). They're very nice people, but they don't want their daughter to be involved in any kind of crime. So when they see Tom driving away in the stolen car, they call the cops.\n\nTom drives the car into the water and dies. His body floats to the surface and the police find it. It turns out that Tom had put a note inside the car saying that he was going to commit suicide. And he did.\n\nWhen the police arrive, they realize that the car is missing.

    "(WARNING! SPOILERS! DO NOT READ!!!!)\n\n\"I was so excited for this movie, for \"Lords of Dogtown\". I knew of the movie only having vague information about it. At first I was very skeptical regarding the film since it is so different from what I had been used to. Although the movie didn't disappoint the fans of \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", I didn't see the humor as much. Even though it wasn't funny in the true sense, it was funny at a few points when the characters didn't take the situation too seriously, which I really liked the most. However, I didn't see that same humor in the movie. There wasn't much humor at all, so I didn't care for it the entire time. The action scenes and some of the fights were really well done though. If you want to see a good, action packed film, than \"Lords of Dogtown\" is for you. As far as plot goes, nothing really changes from how it was in the movie \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\". I think some could be bothered by the plot holes as was pointed out in the movie review on IMDB.com.\"\n\n\"Overall, \"Lords of Dogtown\" was well worth the watch. If you are a fan of \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", then this will be right up your alley.\"\n\nMy overall opinion of the movie:\n\nThis movie definitely changed more than just the tone. It also made you want to learn more about the characters! It was even more entertaining seeing a sequel, which is always fun. I had fun at the theater and will be glad to see the sequel. I am glad I bought the DVD and I will definitely enjoy watching it in the future. \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" may not have been exactly the same, but it was a decent enough movie to have fun watching it all over again. The \"Lord of Dogtown\" storyline had the best moments and I enjoyed the action set pieces that were used throughout. I still hope they make a sequel and it can be fun to see the characters back in town.\n\nThe cast was good and fun to watch. I liked how they portrayed their characters. The humor in \"Lord of Dogtown\" was also interesting and it was great",

    "This is an excellent film, and I'm not just saying that because it's my favorite sci-fi/action flick of 2017. It's also one of the best films in recent memory about the human condition. The story follows LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) as he investigates a series of murders committed by replicants who have been created to be more human than humans. He soon discovers that these replicants are being hunted down by a mysterious organization known only as \"the corporation.\" This group has developed a new form of life called \"Replicant 2.0,\" which they intend on using to take over the world. As K pursues this mystery, he finds himself drawn into a battle between two opposing forces: those who want to use Replicant 2.0 to save humanity, and those who wish to destroy it.\n\nI've seen many reviews of this film, but none of them really hit me like this one did. It was so well written, so thoughtfully paced, and so beautifully shot that I couldn't help but feel compelled to share it with you all.\n\nHere's what I loved about this review:\n\n1. Ryan Gosling is fantastic as K. His performance is so nuanced and layered that it makes him seem almost superhuman. He plays K as someone who is both sympathetic and completely ruthless. He doesn't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in his way or even if he thinks they're innocent. He's a man who will do anything to protect his family and friends. And yet, he's also a man who can't stand to see people suffer.\n\n2. The cinematography is stunning. Every single frame of this film looks beautiful. There's no doubt that director Denis Villeneuve put a lot of work into making sure every scene looked amazing.\n\n3. The music is incredible. The score is composed by Hans Zimmer, whose previous credits include \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal.\n\n4. The acting is top notch. Harrison Ford is great as Rick Deckard, and Jared Leto is terrific as the villainous Tyrell Wellick. Both actors bring their A game here.\n\n5.

    "John Wick – A film that you've definitely not seen before, as well as one that you can see in a flash but not in full detail.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss this film and what it stands for as an old story from the 70's or 80's with cheesy characters and cliched action. On the surface we'd be wrong, because this is still a film that manages to make us care and feel for the characters involved. All the elements of the action sequences, cool gadgets, brutal fights, and of course, a bit of nudity makes it worthy of a close look.\n\nIf you're a fan of The Raids and the other great action films, you're bound to enjoy this film as well. We see Wick at his old stomping grounds. Although his story doesn't develop as much as in The Raids (and that's a great thing), Wick's journey does. We get to see a lot of what he was like when we last saw him. He's tough, he's no b****, and he's definitely back. The other character is definitely played by Keanu Reeves, who is perfectly portrayed and fits right into the character. This movie is a lot of fun and not too hard to enjoy.\n\nWatch it to get a taste, but when you see it in the theater, you might need some water, because it's action galore!\n\n\"John Wick: Chapter 2\" will be directed by Chad Stahelski and stars John Wick himself, Keanu Reeves, and many more.\n\nFor my review of the first John Wick please CLICK HERE.\n\nFor my review of the second John Wick please CLICK HERE.",

It also makes you feel sorry for the man who killed her, which is important because he was clearly a monster.\n\nI'm going to give this one three stars because I think it's a very good movie.",

In addition there are two championship series between British Columbia and Bologna in Australia and a new series that will begin next year with an edition in Thailand sponsored by Dorna Sport.

    "A Canadian computer science student by the name of Dane Cook is in the running for first place in the Google Science Fair's high-profile \"coding competition for the common man, for the common woman, for everyone\" after developing a bot called Hairy Cactus. The bot uses an English dictionary to translate tweets for the purposes of providing context. Cook has been selected from four hundred and thirty-six entries in the competition, which he won last week, to present his bot at the conference in San Francisco next month.\n\nHairy Cactus is already out in a beta state, available under a Creative Commons license and developed with the knowledge resource Wikibon. Hairy Cactus is designed to be mobile, easy to use, and easy to extend. It was created for the sake of improving understanding and communication of the science of evolution among people of diverse cultures and backgrounds, and it should not, however, be misconstrued as a bot for any particular topic or topic-positions.\n\nIn an interview posted to the YouTube channel of the Vancouver chapter of the Wikimedia foundation, Cook described the project as:\n\n\"I was inspired by the English-language twitter corpus, and I wanted to develop a software tool that would allow people of all backgrounds to contribute to the discussion on evolution. This is my way of trying to use technology to make the world a bit less dull.\"\n\nCook explained that most software developed by humans is designed to be very efficient and, thus, often results in a lot of information redundancy. By working with a corpus of English tweets rather than with random text, however, the software becomes more effective and efficient overall. The corpus he studied consisted mostly of popular content from Twitter, including a couple of books but also a variety of popular media.\n\nBut the actual program's structure is quite unique and has caught the attention of other coder and computer science fans. Cook explains:\n\n\"To improve the corpus, it would be nice to be able to add new, high quality tweets that weren't in the other corpora because they may have just as high of a proportion of high quality tweets. If we can do that, it would make it a lot easier to see the diversity of the science in this debate - and there's no shortage of diversity there, because different people live on different continents, have quite distinct histories, and are interacting with the science on a daily",

    "Hurricane Esther was a Category 5 storm known as the Hurricane of the Six Weeks (August 1946 in the NHC). It was a tropical storm in the Atlantic Ocean with winds of 185-200 miles per hour during the evening of August 26, 1946, when it formed.\n\nHistorical meteorological research shows that a hurricane of this size would have the potential to produce severe coastal storm surges and damaging winds. Hurricane Esther's maximum sustained winds were at 175 mph and its minimum sustained winds were at 120 mph, but it had a very large peak wind and very light winds. Despite the fact that Esther's winds were rated Category 5, its maximum sustained wind was more in line with more moderate Hurricane Camille, as was the storm's maximum sustained wind speed; Camille came within 200 miles of San Francisco.\n\nIt is also notable that, with that much wind, Esther failed to make landfall on California except along the coastline. For several hours, the wind was reported to be \"almost constantly gusting to 60 miles per hour\" in the Golden Gate Peninsula but then the wind abated somewhat and by 8:30 p.m. it had decreased to about 50 miles per hour. Esther's closest neighboring storms, Hurricane Carla, produced hurricane or storm surge flood heights of about 5 feet. Hurricane Esther was predicted by NHC forecasters to produce at least a small amount of rainfall. However, the storm ended up dumping as much as 15.3 inches of rain by midnight and flooding several hundred miles of coastline across the northern tip of the peninsula. The last major rainfall recorded in the area occurred less than two hours before the storm hit. Rainfall in the Bay Area was measured in a rain gauge near the Marin Headlands by the Naval Observatory on the night the storm hit. Its maximum depth was 8.9 feet at 11:00 p.m. on 9/26/1946, and its minimum depth of 5 feet at 5:00 a.m. was measured at 3:50 a.m. that morning. For more detail, see the National Hurricane Center (NHC) webpage for the official NHC record of the winds and rainfall.\n\nAs of September 2008, the National Weather Service is not aware of any significant remnants of Hurricane Esther left to study.",

Oh well we'll see...       The last song that got recorded on the show was a tribute to the Australian and Irish rock band Toto. They had some trouble completing what used to be called \"Song 2\", due to contractual squabbles as TOTO's manager refused to let the band sing lyrics out loud after a meeting he requested because we didn't want the audience getting hurt when their vocal cords were literally cut off; however, they eventually nailed the final line which says \"And there was love beyond the moon.\" It turns out \"song 2\" can actually be released as a music video on Youtube…        \"They said we'd have a good story,\" Kurt Loder recalled when I asked him how it came together.\"That was why I agreed to come back [into the show].

    "\"Outcome-primacy (OPA) is a phenomenon whereby one set of results dominates another based simply on the fact that they're occurring earlier rather than later in time, often for reasons that no longer have any real relevance. In many cases it has to do with people not being able to cope with a very bad outcome, and some researchers argue that this may actually encourage them to change their minds about issues and pursue alternative approaches, or even be able to shift outcomes toward favorable ones.\" \"In many situations it's also possible to take advantage of this. Because things are going well, it can be easy, especially with hindsight data like hindsight bias and self-serving bias, to conclude that you've just gotten lucky, because now you know what will happen next time – i.e., what will happen as opposed to what would seem to happen if, say, your best option was to wait before taking action. The reverse problem is that since much is still uncertain, there's still much you don't know and so a bit more uncertainty makes some actions at least theoretically safe from chance influence.\"[1] Wikipedia article on Outcome Primacy : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_primacy?_%28philosophy%29#Possible_implications\n\n\nThis sounds somewhat silly, but I find that I am prone to agree with him, albeit only slightly - despite the obvious evidence of how he himself works with data in which some of my assumptions conflict with his own conclusions.",
    "\"A CIII-delta (conventional ICBM) has a payload capacity about equal to that of a conventional large missile such as the ICBM UDMH or SSM. Like any other long range ballistic missile, Ciii [C3E]s can carry either nuclear weapons; nonnuclear weapons with submunitions; additional nuclear/biological/chemical warheads and reentry vehicles. The number of additional warhead options also increases over prior missiles.\"\n\n\nFrom this we are clearly told: 1) We're not talking the kind of nuke the UK's B70 \"Bumblebee\" carries; 2) There will be three different nuclear payloads on each CIII which allows two (and maybe even four!) warheads; 3) These payload configurations allow at least three warhead slots with only one \"special requirement\"; 4) Only at high altitudes and altamissions do US/NATO's SSMs gain speed enough for nosedive-killing capability; 5) US/Nato's ICbMs are too heavy not to use this new weapon system.\n\n\nWhat's interesting is these claims don't say much in terms of US/USSR nuking of Europe, what the actual target would have been. For me this has some relevance; the same thing happened within months when the US finally started dropping its cluster bomb bombs and dropped them inside populated areas in northern Iraq. As many Americans know (my brother included), there was no real military advantage, and civilians were killed indiscriminately. When asked after the drop, Bush said, \"I told you there could be problems\".\n\n\nNow let's get into the specifics.

He was one of the most important figures in the development of modern art during the 1920s and 1930s. His work has been described as being 'a hybrid between Cubist painting and surrealism'.\n\nBohórquez's works are characterized by their use of color, light, and texture to create a sense of depth and space. The artist often used the medium of oil paint on canvas or wood paneled panels. In addition to his paintings, he also created sculptures that were made out of plaster casts of human bodies.\n\nIn addition to his work with oil paints, Bohórquez also painted landscapes, portraits, and other forms of figurative art. He was known for his use of abstract expressionism, which combined elements of abstraction, impressionism, and cubism.\n\nHis work was exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1925, where it won the Prix Goncourt.

    "Borani is a village in Jharkhand state, India. It is located at the eastern edge of Nandgaon district on the border with Odisha State. The state capital is Calcutta (Kolkata). The city has large numbers of slum dwellers and its residents spend most of their time either unemployed or underpaid farmers living out of their vehicles. In the summer months the village is covered by swarms of Indian Summer Rain, when it rains repeatedly between June and September. In contrast to urban populations, however, people in Borani are often subsistence farmers who live off the land as villagers tend their land every single day. The rain is so frequent that most households have only one house so they must stay inside during heavy precipitation but can move outdoors only during the heaviest hours; they cannot get into or back out of homes due to safety concerns. Despite these hardships ordinary life nevertheless goes on for Borani's population mainly because many of them do not have reliable sources of transportation or even adequate facilities for water supply, they rely entirely upon agriculture and livestock, relying heavily on natural spring-fed wells which may dry up throughout the year due to evaporation; therefore, they remain exposed to severe drought conditions, especially during wet seasons. The villages have no electricity, telephone connections or television screens except for local broadcasts which are transmitted over extremely poor radio waves that make it difficult for residents to properly transmit the messages within the village unless equipped with some sort of portable receiver, however for many rural areas this solution is impossible since there isn't enough transmission range to reach remote areas. Some homes also possess rudimentary indoor plumbing, although the quality varies greatly among houses due to varying construction methods. In addition to living without power and with barely any running water or sanitation, there is little opportunity for income generation and most villagers are reliant solely on agricultural production for their own survival. It has been estimated that there are about 5500 families remaining in the villages with a similar story repeating itself amongst the other 18 villages around the village. Although most members, mostly young men aged 18–45, have left the area their homes remained untouched by foreign forces who occupied Bhubaneswar during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965 (which led to hundreds of thousands of deaths), leaving the locals largely indifferent towards the foreigners occupying their lives. This indifference would then lead to violent clashes with those living outside of Borani which eventually resulted in",

Oxtoby (born December 21, 1957 in Melbourne) gained worldwide notoriety following his appearance on the first season episode of The Prisoner with Robert Webb in 1976.\n\nOxtoby was a noted criminal and human rights activist and an advisor for the Australia-based Human Rights Commission. During his short-lived career as a human rights lawyer in East Berlin in the mid-1970s, Oxtoby founded the Federal Institute for Human Rights. He worked with the Commission alongside fellow human rights lawyer Robert Webb. Although a member of the Commission's staff, Oxtoby was frequently unable to attend meetings because he was imprisoned, tortured and placed under house arrest for many years.\n\nAlthough he was often referred to as the \"Australian Dr. Strangelove\", Oxtoby held a varied background, ranging from serving in the Australian Armed Forces during the Vietnam War to a stint at the University of Michigan Law School. Oxtoby also received his law degree from the University of East Anglia, and was admitted to practice in New South Wales, Victoria and New Zealand.\n\nOxtoby has been active in Australian political and human rights advocacy since the mid-1970s.\n\nAlthough Oxtoby was often imprisoned under the direction of the Soviet-sponsored East German regime during the Cold War, Oxtoby maintains that he was never part of the Communist Party, but rather a supporter of the democratic \"Red\" movement. He has been a strong supporter of the Democratic Party of the United States. While imprisoned under the orders of East Germany from 1955 to 1984, Oxtoby was a member of an underground Communist Party.\n\nIn late 1984, Oxtoby founded a small organization calling itself the Communist Party of Australia and the Socialist Workers Party. Oxtoby and his co-founders were members of the Australian Committee on Unpeople, a collective of leading international human rights law scholars who campaigned for legal reform in the wake of the 1981 Amnesty International Report into state sponsored executions under Communist China.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1992, Oxtoby worked as a researcher with the East Germany Human Rights Commission in the Ministry of Justice in Erfurt.

    "There is no shortage of fashion forecasts these days, with the likes of Elle, Grazia, and The New York Post predicting the new season's fashion trends. I also happen to be doing my own forecasting this year. That's why I decided to focus on a very important aspect – the style trends of a very important and influential group of men's fashion designers. This group happens to be the most influential men's fashion design group in the world.\nWhen I started this project I expected to find that many men's fashion designers would be making major changes to their existing designs and that other men's fashion designers might be making radical departures from their current styles. What I found, and what I'm about to tell you, is entirely the other way round. In both cases I found that most men's fashion designers will be continuing to adapt and improve upon their existing designs.\nFirst I will take a closer look at what fashion was in 2012. Fashion in 2012 will of course continue to evolve since many of the men's fashion designs that make it to store shelves were developed in the past year.\nHere are the most significant fashion trends I observed in 2012:\nThe trend of Men's Fashion being influenced and/or influenced by their personal style is accelerating and the rise of individual style is becoming more common in men's fashion. People are now comfortable with their personal style and feel they can share this style with others. This also means that individual style is becoming a more important aspect of men's fashion. The recent recession has affected men's fashion and helped to define both how people view men's fashion and how people define individual style. People are starting to look upon men's clothing as part of their personal fashion, rather than just an accessory to be worn together with their average outfit. This is something that people used to do in the 80s but that doesn't seem to be as much the case now.\nThis year has seen the rise of a small number of fashion companies with high consumer loyalty by following their customers into fashion retail outlets. These companies are selling quality products that have exceptional quality of construction and the best quality materials available in the market. These companies have achieved the success they have because they were able to maintain their quality and the customer relationships they have with their customer for a long period of time. Many of them still follow their customers and they remain loyal to the products they have created and make these products affordable to the",

    "RTP1 (reversible transcription factor 1) is a member of the R family of transcription factors, which are involved in DNA replication and repair. It was first identified as a gene by its association with the human disease, Gaucher's disease. The protein has been shown to be essential for normal cell growth and differentiation, but it also plays a role in cancer development. In addition, RTP1 is expressed at high levels in many cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, colon, ovarian, pancreatic, skin, and bladder.\n\nIn this case, I'm not sure what you mean by \"normal cell growth\". If you're referring to the cells that make up your body, then yes, they do grow normally. But if you're talking about the cells that make up tumors, then no, they don't grow normally. They grow abnormally. And that's why we have to treat them like cancerous tumors.\n\nI think you're confusing two different things here. First, there is a difference between normal cells and tumor cells. Normal cells can divide indefinitely without any problems. Tumor cells cannot. So when we say that cancer grows abnormally, we're really saying that cancer cells are abnormal. That's why we need to kill them off.\n\nSecond, I don't know how you could possibly confuse RTP1 with another gene called Rbx2. Rbx2 is a very important gene in cancer research because it helps us understand how genes work together to cause cancer. However, RTP1 is not related to Rbx2. You can read more about Rbx2 on Wikipedia.\n\nSo, let me get this straight. You want to talk about something that doesn't exist? Then go ahead and create it yourself!",

    "Name – Hanoch al-Bakhtiari (Hanan, 1477–1558), Jewish scholar and historian was born in Basra and died there. He lived in Baghdad between 1529 and 1534, and lived during the reign of Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II (ruled 1540–1605). He served as a professor at the academy in Basra for fifty years (included in one term of office). Among his numerous works were two major work, Fikrimi de l'al quran wa alfaman fi 'lmamawtiyyat (On Creation in the Koran and its Inference to History and Its Proofs from History) and Tafseer Qabristan (or The Holy Traditions or The Sacred Laws). His work has been called the definitive source for Islamic history.[6] It is based mainly on Muslim sources which are considered reliable such as traditions cited by Muslim historians, biographies and narratives about the life and career of Prophet Mohammad and his companions as recounted by contemporaries, biographies about the leaders of early Islamic states, descriptions, maps, charts, historical accounts, chronicles and letters; all compiled into two volumes.[7] Most of his writings including those mentioned above have become part of school curricula throughout the world.[8][9]",
    "[…] According to various sources, Mark W. Ellingson was named after his grandmother's maiden name, and \"Ellingson\" originated because several witnesses reportedly mistook it as a girl's maiden name.[1] He has become one of the most well-known members of the Satanic Temple, in large part due to publicity around events such as the group's public unveiling ceremony at the Temple's headquarters on February 24 – where he also presented his proposal for Temple Square. … Several people who claim they have read Ellingson's letter express doubt that it has anything to do with the Temple. Still, some are unimpressed by the apparent fakery—one person says \"it doesn't say 'Elvin' if it didn't mean 'Elbert.'\" This uncertainty makes Ellingson himself a candidate for having deceived whoever authored him—given just how close to the truth there seems to be about Ellingson's story.[2] […] The writer says: \"I'm sorry, but this must happen… We all know something happened between the time those memos were written and the day before when I took them back from W.'s office to mail them in.\" According to information obtained through FOIA requests, [Ellingson], apparently as an act of revenge against W., sent four anonymous letters containing forged documents shortly before his February 25 inauguration and then posted the first of these online two days later. These letters purport to offer evidence that many prominent citizens had been conspiring behind the scenes to strip away legal protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, or even enact an American Sharia Law regime.

    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate_3-kinase\n\nWhen food is consumed, it must be broken down by the body to be absorbed. The stomach then breaks down the food to yield a more usable form. As the food sits in the stomach, enzymes in the stomach and the small intestine break the nutrients down. The digestion of each nutrient occurs depending upon the presence of certain molecules in each molecule of that nutrient. These molecules are called small-amino acids (SAAs) and can be separated from each other using enzymes. The digestive enzymes breakdown the chemical structure of some of the nutrients. This process produces what is known as the \"small-amino acid racemase.\" The enzyme known as \"lipid\" is responsible for converting the small-amino acids from the initial enzymes to the actual small-amic-acid molecule. \"Sulphur\" is responsible for allowing each molecule to be absorbed while remaining soluble in the small intestine. When a molecule is absorbed into the blood, it is incorporated into the cells of the body where some of the SAAs are then used to make protein (which increases the body's supply of all the other SAAs being absorbed by the body). This all is needed to achieve the balance necessary to sustain a well- functioning body and prevent diseases that result from an unbalanced diet. But if the amount of food consumed are increased then this equilibrium can't exist anymore (in the same way that water can't exist if there are too many lakes). The food is too large to be used in an effective manner, so it is broken down into pieces, which can't be absorbed fully, so the whole ends up in the intestines and there is an accumulation of this \"foodstuff\" in the large intestine that has the same effect as a reservoir of water with all the food's chemicals. This could then result in a build up of toxins in the small intestine (which would lead to inflammation, obesity and other issues). Thus, some people feel that eating too many \"food bits\" results in the accumulation of toxins in the digestive system and, to some extent, this is true...but not for everyone. It's a matter of \"taste\". If you eat a good, balanced diet you won't have a problem. If you don't then you might just",
    "In October 2005 David Hewes was found guilty by the House of Commons and fined £3,500 for 'bringing down' the prime minister during 2003 general election campaign, in which he had worked as Special Political Adviser for the Labour Party (PLP). The conviction was widely reported but little discussed, other than a short post-trial report published on 16 July 2004 from Mr Justice Holroyde describing him as a 'criminal' who brought down Blair. In his prosecution remarks before the jury at Reading County Court on 1st December 2005 Judge Peter Cummings referred to him as a serial offender, adding that there were three previous convictions; they were all for causing mischief but nothing else; both had been for the offence where he had been convicted of carrying out a public nuisance by using abusive language; one a breach of the PCPA with the damage or destruction value in excess of £200 and the second for a further criminal act involving a public official or servant when he damaged property valued in excess of £50. One of those four offences for which he was sentenced was the charge of making offensive words against the Queen in November 1999 while still serving in the House of Lords. As it has now turned out two of these were wholly unrelated.\n\nSo for David Hewes (and I imagine many lawyers will have been familiar with this case) he appeared before a court, went through the trial process, got convicted by the judge, received a community payment of more money and is now having his reputation ruined forever with this stupid book. At least he wrote that.\n\nLet's go over some key points from that sentence about what was alleged in a 'disturbance'. In particular I think you can make out that a) Mr Hewes said things which others interpreted as being threatening and racist b) He had used abusive language. What could any sensible human being expect? No one did anything except hold onto their beliefs and if your actions create discomfort then so be it…but the judge wasn't so nice. If you read beyond paragraph 6 you'll discover something like this:\n\nThis defendant showed total disregard for civil liberty, including Mrs [redacted] and her rights of freedom of expression. His behaviour caused serious distress to her. While in this situation she felt fear … This result occurred because she suffered from mental illness…\n\nNow let's move to Philip Davies MP:\n\nMr Hewes also made derogatory comments to the victim",

He is a pioneer in the field of American and Anglican universalism.\n\nI will start this article with the very first sentence of his bio, which includes these facts:\n\nHe was born in England on November 13, 1886, the son of George Frere and Maria Elizabeth Spencer.\n\nAnd now, let us read:\n\nIn 1887 Frere accepted an invitation to study at the St. George's, Oxford, School of Law. There he befriended another Oxford dropout named Alfred Russel Wallace, who had studied under Robert Walpole (Frere's contemporary). Wallace became a close friend of Frere's and helped him raise his social status among the rich and powerful. Frere spent 18 years in Oxford, and in 1897, he was ordained a deacon by the Rt. Revd. George Sanderson, Bishop of Newbury and London. Frere subsequently served as first a bishop in the New College at Oxford, and as Episcopal Bishop of New York in London. Frere was in New York on July 12, 1937 when the first U.S. Air Force base in Cuba was established.\n\nThe \"Rastafarian\" part of Frere's background and religion will be highlighted, but let's concentrate on the important first sentence:\n\nFrere became a close friend of Alfred Russel Wallace, who had studied under Robert Walpole (Frere's contemporary).

She was previously a member of the band Deep Purple and then joined the legendary Queen for 1987 and 1988. Her first solo album, With Love from Ann James, was released in 1999. Her 2006 album, The Queen Is Dead, was hailed as an innovative collection of sound-alikes and an even more ambitious experiment, a work that merges Queen's original sounds with modern production techniques to create a totally original, immersive, and ambitious recording process. Her music is highly influenced by the works of John Cage and David Bowie.\n\n\nThe album's title references Queen's famous anthem \"The Show Must Go On\" and includes the line, \"'Cause love never dies, you can do that without me\"...\"\n\n\nIn the above excerpt was mentioned \"With Love from Ann James\", this is an unspoken reference to how their \"love never dies\" song was written at a time in the band members life when her then boyfriend Mark Cooper was diagnosed with cancer and how the song expressed her sadness and sadness at what was happening around her.\n\n\nNow, some may wonder why would a band refer to their \"love never dies\" song as \"The King\" and not the more common title of \"With Love from Ann James\". After all, not much is known about Ann James. So why the reference to the \"King\" in the song's title, as well as within the song itself? Well, this is an interesting and complex clue to all that is going wrong in the world of Queen and Queen, and the ultimate and most powerful song that is the 'With Love from Ann James' album.\n\n\nWe have to go back to April 30, 1968 when the band met and became friends for the first time. This was the month that Queen opened for U.S. band The Who at Wembley Stadium in London, England. During the concert many celebrities and royalty were there to see them play. One of those celebrities was King Henry VIII. In fact, Queen made several appearances after their concert at Wembley stadium in support of the King's marriage to Anne Boleyn. King Henry VIII gave Anne Boleyn an amazing engagement ring, for which Queen made an apology to Mark Cooper, who, like Ann James, was also a member of Deep Purple and Queen.

Evans, also known as the 'Harold Evans Attorney', was a defense attorney specializing in criminal appeals and civil cases through much of the 20th century.[1][2][3] He was also a successful lawyer for several Hollywood studios[4][5], as well various companies such as the film company Tri-Star Pictures and Warner Bros., among others. Evans maintained office in Los Angeles, California, where he later moved to Beverly Hills with his family after his parents' divorce.[6][7] He practiced law until January 5, 1981 when he became involved with The National Council on Crime and Delinquency,[8] whose mission statement stated that it aimed to combat crime for public safety rather than promoting any particular philosophy or ideology.[9] His clients ranged from drug addicts to serial killers. Over the years, he gained considerable media attention through interviews with major newspapers, including The New York Times, Time Magazine, USA Today, CBS Evening News with Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News with Dan Rather, People magazine, Newsweek Magazine and ABC's 60 Minutes at the annual Christmas event called The ABA Holiday Concert.[10] In recent years, he has become best known for filing petitions claiming the right to bear witness in capital punishment trials by virtue of having been a judge during death penalty trials.[11] He continues to speak about issues related to \"death row\" executions through public appearances.[11][12]\n\nA biography in the Washington Post states, \"...in 1955, he was indicted for contempt and fined $500 for contempt of court over his refusal to follow a federal magistrate's instructions to preserve certain records before trial.\"[13] On 3 December 1963, just hours before President John F.

    "A prominent white supremacist, John Tanton, also known as \"Dr. T,\" was a co-founder and leader of American Renaissance; which describes itself as \"a crossroads for eugenicists, racists, xenophobes, nativists, egalitarians/national liberationists and other right wing organizations.\"[7] His first marriage, to Marion Gaines (nee White), was dissolved by divorce upon his conversion.[8] [9][10] His sister Helen was a noted novelist and short story writer who wrote the best selling fantasy series The Crystal Princess, the second and last volume of which contains Ayn Rand's Ayn Rand Presents Her Mother and Other Tales about Growing Up a Rock 'n' Roll Kid. He once said he wished she had been born black so that she could have written some science fiction or even some fiction herself. He and her divorced while he was working on the original draft of Atlas Shrugged. She became very ill and died in 1998, but not before publishing five more novels set in the fantasy world and related subgenres. His mother told him in a letter that his writing was inspired by The Fountainhead and that she had \"never heard of any of Rand's books except Atlas\".\n\n[11]. In the early 1930s there were attempts to find money to remove the term. Although the attempt failed and it remained a racial slur until at least 1967—to the delight and dismay of white supremacists—the term did not take off when racial segregation ceased in public spaces such as restaurants and theatres on October 13, 1868, at around midnight, which came four days after Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his speech on the subject to The Riverside Church and Congress, both of New York City. That is significant because if King were assassinated within weeks of his speeches receiving worldwide coverage (not including newspapers outside the U.S.) then many would assume that it was over the issue of race. Because we can now say with precision how important King's speech had become over time, what role John Tanton played in making it happen, and why I do think Malcolm X had some things to do with how popular racism began taking hold throughout America (and beyond) again in the late 1970s and 1980s, let us keep his legacy alive for future generations...",

    "In 1864, a group of white men and women led by John Brown began a raid on Harper's Ferry, Virginia, to free slaves who had been held in bondage for more than two decades. The raid was unsuccessful, but it did lead to the abolition of slavery in the United States. In the aftermath of the raid, many people were outraged that the raiders would not have freed all the slaves at once. Some argued that they should have killed every slave in sight, while others believed that the raiders should have spared some of them so as to avoid further bloodshed.\n\nThis quote comes from a book called \"Black Sands\", written by Dr. William J. Bennett, which was published in 1968. It is a very interesting read about the history of black liberation movements in America. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning more about the history of black liberation movements in America.",
    "[1]\n\nDuring the Cold War era, several US Presidents had military jets built for use against Moscow, but they never flew (in the time frame they were designed) into combat due to cost and political problems.

    "In February 2014, a Russian court sentenced Taymuraz Mamsurov to death for his role in organizing and leading the Chechen separatist movement. The sentence was upheld by Russia's Supreme Court on March 6, 2015. On May 1, 2016, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the trial had been unfair and violated international law. In its ruling, the ECHR stated that the trial had not taken into account evidence provided by the prosecution, including testimony from witnesses who were tortured during their interrogation. The ECHR also found that the trial judge had failed to consider the possibility that the defendants' statements could have been coerced or influenced by torture. The ECHR ordered the Russian government to pay Taymuraz Mamsurov's legal costs.\n\nI am sure you will agree with me when I say that this is one of the most disgusting things I have ever read about human rights in my entire life. It is so sad that we live in such a world where people are being punished for what they believe in. This is just another example of how our governments are trying to silence those who speak out against injustice.",

    "Iltyd Nicholl Clayton (December 10, 1926–October 25, 2013) was an American singer and songwriter best known for her early solo recordings. She was one of the first successful black female artists and the first to achieve mainstream success in the US. She also began her career with the backing group New Jack Swing but went on to be part of several other popular acts. After achieving success as a solo artist in New York City, Clayton had her first studio session on October 2, 1939. Her first studio album was released August 1, 1942. Clayton's career as a songwriter, performer, and record producer spanned most of the 1940s. Her singles became well known with their strong melodies and distinctive riffs. In 1948, Clayton released her debut studio disc, the double-LP, I Want to Be Happy and I Want it Now, which received extensive airplay in post-war America and also became a major hit for the Beatles. In 1949, Clayton's single \"You're the One That I Want\" hit the top five in the country. Clayton's major singles \"I'm Waiting for the Man\" and \"I've Got Something in My Heart\" were both top ten singles in the 1940s, and the titles of the album records are the first records in which she contributed vocals to songs that became Top Ten pop songs. Clayton's last studio album was the 1961 release, The Soul of an Angel, which featured a recording of I Want to Be Happy. She died in Los Angeles on October 25, 2013.\n\nIs there a link there between the title of Clayton's song I Want to Be Happy and the title of the song that the band that Clayton was part of that she is famous for \"playing the music\" has written called The Best of All Possible Worlds?\n\nNow I could be wrong, but it seems to me that that song did in fact go on to become popular enough to warrant a \"big hit\" and the inclusion of the songs \"You're the One That I Want\" and \"I've Got Something in My Heart.\"\n\nMaybe there is still a connection to be made?\n\nAdvertisements",

    "Doris Dana [sic] (\"Dorothy\") Dana, born May 7 1931 in Detroit, Michigan as Dorothy Cates Dana to Henry and Louise Dana, was an American film and television producer. Dana began as a drama student at the University of Detroit and, over the course of her career, she wrote and directed four feature films.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Dana\n\nMy thoughts: What are the odds that this Dorothy Dana is a cousin of Michelle Obama's, a relative of Barack Obama's mother, one of several cousins who were married in an interracial marriage, and that they were part of the same \"community\" and/or \"tribe\", or perhaps a cousin of one of the Obamas' Kenyan relatives (I guess that's another thing that makes sense)?\n\nAnd yet, some \"journalists\" claim the Obamas are so \"closeted\", that they're not really open about their family relationships. Isn't that curious? I don't remember them as having that mentality until recently.\n\nAnd what's more, aren't the Obamas trying to hide something about themselves–something that could have huge ramifications for politics, and perhaps for the world as we know it?\n\nUPDATE: It looks like Dorothy is more than just another member of the Obamas' extended family. The Obamas' \"family\" was mentioned in a 2011 Forbes article, which is below:\n\nDorothy Obama is the daughter of Barack and Ann Dunham. Her father and mother were married in 1963, but their relationship was not very serious. At that time the younger Obama was four years old. Their relationship was so close that there was a period when the family would take vacations abroad together, according to author J.C. King in his 1987 book, The Bully. President Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, worked as a lawyer for a law firm with ties to a communist firm in Chicago that was engaged by the Russian KGB in the 1950s and 1960s. She also worked for the anti-Castro Cubans. Obama's father didn't know anything about his wife's political activities, she was \"his child by proxy\".\n\nUPDATE2: And as of Feb. 23, 2010, the Obamas' cousin and a cousin of Obama's mother Ann Dunham, died in plane crash in Kenya.",
    "Luis Carlos Montalvan is a Chilean-born lawyer and an academic from Guadalajara. He has worked most of his adult life as a lawyer in Chile and Spain and recently as the dean of the faculty of international studies at the Universidad de Buenos Aires.\n\nHe became a vocal critic of Pinochet's authoritarian government, and in 1975 he founded Información, the journal of a network of human rights groups. He remained imprisoned by Pinochet's forces from 1978 to 1987 when he led three dissident activists and a poet, María Cristina Márquez, through a clandestine escape from the country. They traveled by boat to the United States and on to Ireland, where they settled in London, where he has been living ever since. His book The War at Home: A History of Chilean Dissidence, was published in 1980 and was a key reference work during the military dictatorship.[1]\n\nOn 30 July 2017 the Argentine authorities issued warrants for Montalvan's arrest. Montalvan fled to the United States with three other prominent dissidents: Alfredo Benítez, José Manuel Fraga, and Mariano Perrotta; all three were considered political prisoners at the time due to their refusal to collaborate with Argentinean authorities.[2]\n\nAfter receiving asylum in Argentina for several years in 1985 and 1986, Montalvan published a book titled Confessions of an Invisible Dictator: Inside the Chilean Dictatorship in 1976. The book had an important and immediate effect in the course of a wave of student-led student uprisings in Chile that would lead to the fall of Pinochet. On 15 January 1987, Montalvan was a founding member of the Movement of the Disappeared (MUD) of the Plaza Libre, which was a coalition of dissident student leaders. In December 1989, Montalvan, along with two other MUD leaders in exile, Rafael Boric and Francisco Guiterrez (alias Carlos Humberto) were detained by the Argentinian Military Tribunal that had been set up in the wake of the failed 1988 military coup attempt. The Tribunal released the three participants on 5 April 1990.[3]\n\nIn 1993, after several unsuccessful political moves, Montalvan announced his political engagement with the right-wing opposition, the Alliance of National and International Parties (ANDIAP), which was founded with other opposition"
