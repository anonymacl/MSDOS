    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type. This\ndevelops work of Uhlenbeck, Segal, and Burstall-Guest to non-compact inner\nsymmetric spaces. To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity. This provides a straightforward way to construct all such harmonic\nmaps.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",
    "Deep neural networks have achieved satisfactory performance in piles of\nmedical image analysis tasks. However the training of deep neural network\nrequires a large amount of samples with high-quality annotations. In medical\nimage segmentation, it is very laborious and expensive to acquire precise\npixel-level annotations. Aiming at training deep segmentation models on\ndatasets with probably corrupted annotations, we propose a novel Meta Corrupted\nPixels Mining (MCPM) method based on a simple meta mask network. Our method is\ntargeted at automatically estimate a weighting map to evaluate the importance\nof every pixel in the learning of segmentation network. The meta mask network\nwhich regards the loss value map of the predicted segmentation results as\ninput, is capable of identifying out corrupted layers and allocating small\nweights to them. An alternative algorithm is adopted to train the segmentation\nnetwork and the meta mask network, simultaneously. Extensive experimental\nresults on LIDC-IDRI and LiTS datasets show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches which are devised for coping with corrupted\nannotations.",

    "  It is an important task to faithfully evaluate the perceptual quality of\noutput images in many applications such as image compression, image restoration\nand multimedia streaming. A good image quality assessment (IQA) model should\nnot only deliver high quality prediction accuracy but also be computationally\nefficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is becoming particularly important due\nto the increasing proliferation of high-volume visual data in high-speed\nnetworks. We present a new effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient\nmagnitude similarity deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to\nimage distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image suffer\ndifferent degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of\nglobal variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality\nprediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS)\nbetween the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling\nstrategy the standard deviation of the GMS map can predict accurately\nperceptual image quality.

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic. Edges are constructed by\ndividing image into different catchment basins with the help of a membership\nfunction. Finally closed contour algorithm is applied to find closed regions\nand objects within closed regions are segmented using intensity information.\nThe performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both objectively as well\nas subjectively.

For comparative analysis, various comparison\nmethods are used for demonstrating the superiority of proposed methods over\nexisting segmentation methods.",
    "  The effects of residual amplitude modulation (RAM) in laser interferometers\nusing heterodyne sensing can be substantial and difficult to mitigate. In this\nwork, we analyze the effects of RAM on a complex laser interferometer used for\ngravitational wave detection.

This shift causes variations in\nthe sensing matrix, and leads to degradation in the performance of the\nprecision noise subtraction scheme of the multiple-degree-of-freedom control\nsystem. In addition, such detuned optical cavities produce an opto-mechanical\nspring, which also varies the sensing matrix.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

To efficiently process video, we propose 3D separable\nconvolution for the pyramid pooling module and decoder, which dramatically\nreduces the number of operations while maintaining the performance. Moreover,\nwe also extend our framework to video action segmentation by adding an extra\nclassifier to predict the action label for actors in videos.

Our generative\nadversarial network based model works on a conditional probability approach.\nThis approach makes the image translation independent of any local, global and\ncontent or style features. In our approach we use a bidirectional\nreconstruction model appended with the affine transform factor that helps in\nconserving the content and photorealism as compared to other models. The\nadvantage of using such an approach is that the image-to-image translation is\nsemi-supervised, independant of image segmentation and inherits the properties\nof generative adversarial networks tending to produce realistic. This method\nhas proven to produce better results than Multimodal Unsupervised\nImage-to-image translation.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also\noutperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and\nachieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).",
    "Current state-of-the-art methods for image segmentation form a dense image\nrepresentation where the color, shape and texture information are all processed\ntogether inside a deep CNN. This however may not be ideal as they contain very\ndifferent type of information relevant for recognition. Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark, in terms of both mask\n(mIoU) and boundary (F-score) quality, improving by 2% and 4% over strong\nbaselines.",
    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions. Our proof confirms recent numerical findings that already\nhinted at this convergence. Furthermore we offer a thorough mathematical\nunderpinning for networks of so-called theta neurons, where the OA ansatz has\njust been applied. In a final step we extend our proof by allowing for\ntime-dependent and multi-dimensional parameters as well as for network\ntopologies other than global coupling. This renders the OA ansatz an excellent\nstarting point for the analysis of a broad class of realistic settings.\n",
    "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the non-invasive modality of choice for\nbody tissue composition analysis due to its excellent soft tissue contrast and\nlack of ionizing radiation.

When she thinks her two children do not need her any longer, Lila Schwartz, a sexually active woman, leaves behind her family, calls herself Lila Munroe and moves to California, where she trains, and later works, as a lawyer. Faced with the dual challenge of having to raise two teenage kids while remaining successful in his demanding job as a publicist and speech writer, Bernard Schwartz more and more relies on medication to cope with everyday life. The real trouble begins when he accidentally swallows two incompatible antidepressants and falls into a coma shortly thereafter. While he is unconscious Bernard Schwartz has a stroke. When he wakes up again he is seriously handicapped&mdash;his speech is slurred, his walk is unsteady and his memory is permanently impaired. Similar to a child, he has to learn the meanings of many words. Instead of going to school, Chris teaches his father as best as he can. In spite of his enforced preoccupation with his \"sleeping\" father, Chris Schwartz notices that his own life goes on without any major change. Still a virgin, he fantasizes about having sex with Lisa Danmeyer, Bernard's neurologist and actually has his first sexual encounter ever at his father's rehab centre with a sexy speech pathologist who performs fellatio on him. At the same time Cathy, his 16 year-old sister, is on the brink of abandoning her Jewish roots and converting to Roman Catholicism. However, she also develops a crush on Francis Dial, her brother's best friend and classmate. Chris cannot believe that his younger sister might have sex before he does, but in the end this is exactly what happens, an unwanted teenage pregnancy being the result of their union. At first the young lovers are unsure whether Cathy should have an abortion or not, but Cathy soon makes up her mind to keep the baby.",
    " The school has been run since its inception ten years earlier by two elderly educators, Mabel Edge and Hermione Baker, who are regarded by many as old spinsters hopelessly out of touch with reality, especially with what their teenage charges really think and feel. The 300 or so students are virtually indistinguishable from one another, a fact which is stressed by their names all starting with the letter M: Margot, Marion, Mary, Melissa, Merode, Midget, Mirabel, Moira. Their budding but suppressed sexuality&mdash;they are all between 16 and 18 years of age and \"going to be attractive\"&mdash;is constantly alluded to in the novel. (\"They're only children, the girls I mean, and sex is unconscious at their age. It's such a temptation for a man.\") Of the teaching staff, only few characters are mentioned. There is Miss Winstanley, young, colourless, and secretly in love with one of the few male teachers at the academy, economics tutor Sebastian Birt. Birt, however, a short and stout man in his late twenties, is having an affair with Elizabeth Rock, a 35 year-old woman recovering from a nervous breakdown who temporarily also lives on the school grounds, in her grandfather's cottage. That man, 76 year-old Mr Rock, is a retired scientist who has been granted the privilege to live there for the remainder of his life for past services rendered to the State. The aging Rock, who is referred to as \"the sage\" by some (including the narrator) and as \"Gapa\" by his granddaughter, spends his time mainly with, and for, his pets&mdash;his albino sow, Daisy, his cat, Alice, and his goose, Ted. He describes himself as \"a bit stiff about the joints these days\", he has some difficulty climbing steps, has poor eyesight, is deaf in one ear and almost deaf in the other, and has recently had problems with his memory. In addition, one of his idiosyncrasies consists in putting all the post he gets in a big trunk without opening any of it, ever. Edge, one of the principals, has for some time wanted to thoroughly \"spring-clean\" the whole place and get rid of Rock, his granddaughter, and Birt, partly in order to secure the sage's cottage for the use of additional school staff. In other matters, she is more hesitant. When in the morning some girls report Mary and Merode missing, pointing out that neither of their beds has been slept in, Edge turns out to be very reluctant to use the official channels to inform relatives, the school supervisor, or the local police. Naturally it occurs to her and her colleague Baker that Mary and Merode might have eloped with two young men (\"At the station much of their time was taken up with young women adrift, who, after fourteen days, returned brown and happy from a fortnight with a boy by the ocean.\"), but, rather than fearing the worst, they assume the girls will be back for that night's entertainment, a ball in honour of the academy's founder&mdash;without men of course. At the same time Edge turns down some of the staff's requests to be allowed to go swimming in the nearby lake, which is interpreted as a sure sign that one of the girls' bodies could turn up any time floating in the water. In the course of the day, especially where Rock is involved, lots of people talk at cross-purposes, deliberately as well as accidentally misunderstanding what others are saying, in many instances only hinting at facts or, worse, spreading rumours. Around noon Merode is found, right on the compound but somewhat dazed, under a fallen beech in the vicinity of Rock's cottage&mdash;the very beech tree used by Sebastian Birt and Elizabeth Rock when they want to have some fun. According to school regulations, Merode must not be interrogated before she has submitted a written statement about what has happened, and she is immediately locked away for her own good. The rest of the afternoon is mainly taken up with preparations for the dance. As usual, the Founder's Day Ball is held without any guests from outside the school. However, Rock and his granddaughter turn up unexpectedly but appropriately dressed, without having been invited by anyone. While Mary is still missing (the reader never learns where she is or what has happened to her), Elizabeth Rock and Sebastian Birt start dancing together cheek to cheek and, generally, appear glued to each other, a \"display of animalism\" Edge is not willing to put up with any longer. Almost at the end of her tether, she secretly indulges in a cigarette or two in her office. Meanwhile Mr Rock is accosted by several of the girls who first want to dance with him and later drag him downstairs into the cellar of the building where they take turns kissing him and where they introduce him to the \"Institute Inn\", their secret club. Although Rock initially enjoys the girls' attentions, he quickly becomes appalled by their lack of morals and leaves the \"club.\" He comes upon his nemesis, Miss Edge, but after his experiences with the girls he is more sympathetic to her difficulties maintaining order at the school. For her part, Edge is impressed with the courtly bearing Rock has affected in the Ball's formal setting and also consumed by a tobacco-fueled lassitude. The two older adults have a pleasant conversation which comes to a head when Edge, almost without realizing, finds herself proposing marriage to Rock. The sage is astounded, and politely but firmly rejects her suggestion. He then leaves the ball and returns home to his animals. At the end of the day no one has reached any conclusions, and everything remains undecided.",

The principal claims that she did this to ensure they were wearing proper attire for the school dance. She also claims that her job is not only to ensure they get a proper education, but that they also grow into proper ladies and do not become sluts. She sends several girls home for wearing slutty panties. Although there is no crime to charge her with, Jesse determines to make trouble for her until he can find something to charge her with as he is convinced the girls’ civil rights were violated. He begins interviewing the principal along with her high powered attorney husband, as well as the girls. Later one of the girls comes to see Jesse at his office. She tells him that her parents are swingers, and often host parties for that purpose at their home. She and her little brother hate it and she asks Jesse if he can help. With swinging not illegal, Jesse finds his hands tied, but decides to investigate anyway. He has Suit talk to two of the women, one of whom he knew in high school, to get more information on the swingers club. Suit discovers that the girl’s mother is not into it, but only does it because her husband wants to. Jesse has Spike threaten her husband about the swinging, and she later leaves him. The main plot of the novel involves the investigation of the Night Hawk. The Night Hawk starts as a peeping tom, and the Paradise police get several calls about him. Later the Night Hawk escalates his voyeuristic attacks by breaking into homes while women are home alone, forcing them to undress at gunpoint, and then taking nude photos of them. He then begins writing Jesse detailing his exploits, and includes the nude photos. He writes that he cannot stop himself; he must discover these women’s “secret.” He also writes that he does not know what he will do next and fears that he will escalate further. Jesse begins to combine his investigation of the swingers with his investigation of the Night Hawk. Since the Night Hawk never touches anyone, he questions the swingers to find out if there is anyone in their club that only likes to watch and never touch. The women in the club all identify Seth Ralston. Ralston is a professor of English at a nearby university. He is married to a young grad student who is working on her doctorate. Jesse discovers that Ralston's wife used to teach a Wednesday night class, which corresponds with all the peeping tom reports. He also discovers that the peeping tom reports stopped at the same time that Ralston’s wife quit her teaching job to begin doing her doctoral work full time. Jesse questions Ralston’s wife about the swinging to see if she will inadvertently reveal something about her husband that will confirm he is the Night Hawk, and even hints to her that her husband may be the Night Hawk. She responds by belittling Jesse for being a dumb cop, and singling them out for their lifestyle. Meanwhile Jesse continues to pressure Betsy Ingersoll, who then reports that she is a victim of the Night Hawk. Soon after Jesse receives a nude photo of Betsy, however he and Molly become convinced that she is posing in the photo and suspect the attack was staged. The local media request an interview concerning the attack, and Jesse uncharacteristically agrees. He gives details of the attack and later receives a letter from the Night Hawk who demands that he never attacked Betsy Ingersoll. Jesse believes that the Night Hawk is telling the truth, as he has never denied an attack before, but always been honest about his attacks. Jesse confronts Betsy with this and she admits that she staged the attack. She says that she did it to get some attention from her husband, but that he did not even care. She was acting out because her husband cheats on her constantly with young women, which also explains her obsession with teenage girls not growing up to be sluts. Jesse agrees not to charge her with any crimes if she agrees to see Sunny Randall’s shrink, Dr. Silverman (the long-term love interest of another Parker character Spenser), which she does. A few days later Seth Ralston’s wife comes to Jesse to report that her husband is missing. They begin searching for him, and soon after Jesse receives another letter from the Night Hawk blasting him for speaking with his wife, and ruining his life. He writes that he is going to leave town, but only after he discovers one more woman’s secret, as he calls it, and warns that this woman will be someone close to Jesse. Jesse thinks that he is trying to hint that the woman will be Betsy Ingersoll, but Jesse believes he is actually targeting Molly. They set a police unit in front of Betsy’s house as a decoy, but then stake out Molly’s house. Molly waits at home with a gun strapped to her thigh, and a wire so Jesse can hear her. The Night Hawk breaks in on her and forces her to begin stripping at gun point. Suit and Jesse then break in to arrest him. Surprised that they figured out he was after Molly, he raises his gun to shoot her, but Molly, Suit, and Jesse all shoot and kill Seth Ralston, putting an end to the Night Hawk. Suit is left with a moral dilemma that it was his shot that killed Ralston, but since all three fired, Jesse is able to disfuse the situation by convincing Suit that it could have been any one of the three.",
    " The story outlines contact between Earth and the title Visitors, a group of mysterious objects from deep space. The Visitors are simple black oblong boxes, as large as buildings, which approach from space and orbit the Earth before descending to the United States. The nature of the visitors is kept rather mysterious&nbsp;— it's not clear if they are vehicles or living things in their own right. They are apparently unable to communicate with humans in any meaningful way; on one occasion a human is taken inside a Visitor, only to be released after experiencing a jumble of confusing colored lights and smells which he didn't understand. The Visitors are composed largely of a dense form of cellulose, and they proceed to consume a quantity of trees and plant life in the US. Eventually they start producing vehicles, superficially resembling human cars but capable of flying using the same unknown principles as the Visitors themselves, and apparently incorporating some element of intelligence, or at least instinct, since they do not crash into things as they move. The humans assume that the Visitors have created these vehicles as a gift in return for the plant matter which the Visitors are consuming, and the novel touches on the disruption such well-meaning gifts might incur on the Earth's economic systems. Toward the end of the book the Visitors also start producing housing units for humans, and it is even implied that something living may be inside them&nbsp;— perhaps even a Visitor-produced version of humans themselves.",
    " The Republic is decaying, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was elected to save the galaxy from collapsing under the forces of discontent. On the tiny but strategic planet of Ansion, a powerful faction is on the verge of joining the growing Separatist movement. The urban dwellers wish to expand into the prairies outside their cities - the ancestral territory of the fierce, independent Ansion nomads. If their demands are not met, they will secede - an act that could jump-start a chain reaction of withdrawal and rebellion by other worlds of the Republic. At the Chancellor's request, the Jedi Council sends Kenobi and fellow Jedi Luminara Unduli to resolve the conflict and negotiate with the elusive nomads. Undaunted, Kenobi and Unduli, along with their Padawans Skywalker and Barriss Offee, set out across the wilderness. Many perils lie waiting to trap them. The Jedi will have to fulfill near-impossible tasks, befriend wary strangers, and influence two great armies to complete their quest, stalked all the while by an enemy sworn to see the negotiations collapse and the mission fail.",
    " The Land of Little Rain is a collection of short stories and essays detailing the landscape and inhabitants of the American Southwest. A message of environmental conservation and a philosophy of cultural and sociopolitical regionalism loosely links the stories together. ;\"The Land of Little Rain\" The opening essay describes the \"Country of Lost Borders,\" an area of land between Death Valley and the High Sierras. The image created of the land at the beginning of the story is one of almost unbearable heat and dryness, punctuated by violent storms. Despite the description of how inhospitable the landscape is, at the end Austin proposes that the costs the land imposes upon a man are worth it because it provides man with peace of mind and body that cannot be achieved any other way. ;\"Water Trails of the Ceriso\" The section's title refers to the trails made by wild animals moving towards sources of water. The essay provides descriptions of the many animals that travel along the trails, including coyotes, rabbits, and quails. Their ability to find water where there seems to be none is extolled by Austin, a skill which she believes no human is able to match. ;\"The Scavengers\" This essay describes the various animals that live in the desert that feed upon carrion&mdash;most notably, the buzzards and the carrion crows. This scavenging is portrayed as a natural part of the desert, with a multitude of the scavengers working together to find food. The end of the story criticizes the actions of man with regard to the desert. The unnatural trash he leaves cannot used by the scavengers in the story, and as such serves as a stark contrast to the desert's natural processes for recycling waste. ;\"The Pocket Hunter\" A pocket hunter is a type of miner who hunts for pockets of ore deposits. In the story, the pocket hunter described by Mary Austin lives off of the land with minimal interactions with the civilized world. This harmony with nature, Austin argues, is essential to the pocket hunter's simple happiness. Despite Austin's muted praise, the pocket hunter wants to strike it rich in order to move to Europe and mingle with the landed elite, a goal he accomplishes. However, by the end of the story, the pocket hunter returns to the desert since it is his \"destiny\". ;\"Shoshone Land\" \"Shoshone Land\" narrates the experiences of Winnenap', an American Indian medicine man originally from Shoshone Land who was captured by the Paiute tribe. The story initially revolves around Winnenap', but quickly changes to a detailed description of the environment and wildlife of Shoshone Land to form an intimate tie between Winnenap' and the land he formerly inhabited. ;\"Jimville&mdash;a Bret Harte Town\" In the beginning of the section, Jimville is touted as a better source of inspiration for Bret Harte than he found during his own travels. Jimville's inhabitants are likened to the fictional characters that were present in some of Harte's short stories. Austin portrays Jimville as a small town set in a harsh environment and inhabited by simple yet endearing toughs. Although the inhabitants endure many hardships, Austin claims that there is an almost unexplainable pull which keeps them in town and encourages new travelers to stay. ;\"My Neighbor's Field\" The story is about a plot of land which changes hands many times&mdash;Austin characterizes this plot of land as an ideal field. She criticizes the owners of the field, the Indians and shepherds, because their habits and lifestyle scar the land. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the field is destined to develop into an urban area. Austin claims that while the field may at that point serve a greater human use, it will not be better for the land and all life. ;\"The Mesa Trail\" This section describes one of the trails that runs through the American Southwest. It contains several passages detailing the damage human activity has done to the land. She criticizes the \"unsightly scars\" left by the Paiute Indians in the form of abandoned campoodies and the damaged plant life left by domesticated animals such as sheep. ;\"The Basket Maker\" This story follows the life of Seyavi, a Paiute Indian who loses her mate, lives alone with her child, and sells baskets she weaves in order to survive. Austin claims that the Paiutes make the land itself their home, with the natural ridges of mountains as walls and the wild almond bloom as their furnishings. It is because of this that Austin argues that the Paiutes will always be homesick when in homes built by man, as man cannot replicate nature's walls and furnishings. ;\"The Streets of the Mountains\" This essay consists of long description of mountains and their respective trails. The section characterizes the beauty of the mountains and their inhabitants. The story also contains critiques people who dwell in man-made houses. The comfort provided by such houses, Austin argues, results in people not being able to truly understand the beauty and divinity of the mountains. ;\"Water Borders\" The essay revolves around the streams and lakes that can be found in the mountains, generally formed from the melting snow higher in the mountains. The particular mountain in the story is Oppapago, a mountain within the Sierras in a forest reserve. Austin contrasts the mountain landscape to a meadow outside a forest reserve, which lacks color and beauty because it is damaged by the grazing of sheep. ;\"Other Water Borders\" \"Other Water Borders\" is centered more on the plants affected by the water from the mountains, both wild and cultivated. The story begins with a depiction of a squabble between several locals over an irrigation ditch filled by water from the mountains. This is followed by a series of descriptions of the variety of plants that the irrigation ditch allows to thrive. Found within these depictions of plant life is Austin's lament of the complexities of civilization. Austin implies that with the advent of cities and manufactured objects people have lost an innate ability to know what natural remedies may be beneficial or detrimental to one's health. ;\"Nurslings of the Sky\" The \"nurslings of the sky\" are storms, formed in the hills and given almost human characteristics by Austin. The beginning of the story contains an account of the destruction of a town by floods and snow. The blame for the events is not placed on nature, but rather the people whose poorly placed town was destroyed. The story continues with descriptions of storms and their effects upon the wildlife of the area, pausing to explain how the land teaches people things. The story uses the example of a group of Native Americans who learn the use of smoke signals by observing the dust pillars formed by desert winds at the edges of mesas. The end of the story expresses Austin's discontent at how people have dealt with the weather by determining the best seasons to plant crops rather than by musing about the \"eternal meanings of the skies\". ;\"The Little Town of the Grape Vines\" \"The Little Town of Grape Vines,\" or El Pueblo de Las Uvas, tells a story of a simple people living in peace with their environment. With houses made of mud, homemade wine, and gardens to provide the fruits, vegetables, and herbs, the townspeople live a simple life without the complex notions of wealth and class that Austin feels have corrupted much of society. Austin describes the lives of the people living in the town, lives which consist of little more than planting, harvesting, eating, making music, raising children, and dancing. The end of the story is a call back to the simple life exemplified in \"The Little Town of the Grape Vines,\" criticizing those people who are overly obsessed with their own perceived importance in a world where their actions truly matter little.",
    " The book shares the personal stories of several families fighting autism. These stories focus on alternative autism therapies that they try to heal their children, as well as McCarthy's own reminiscing about her autistic child and her outspoken and contentious activism. The book includes the daughter of the founder of Autism Speaks, who claims to have changed her son's diet and improved his autism despite conspiratorial resistance from the organization, which, the book claims, until recently, rejected research into biomedical treatments; a mother who is claimed \"healed\" her son of his autism while taking on breast cancer; a father whose son was officially undiagnosed after allegedly under-going treatment for a laundry list of debilitating autism symptoms and regressions; and a sixty-year-old woman who made attempts to fight to save her son (now thirty) in the 1980s, the book exclaims that she paved the way for the parents of today. The book also features a list of controversial autism resources and a directory of DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) doctors who are sympathetic to the widely discredited theory that autism is caused by mercury in vaccines.",
    " Azriel is telling the story of his transformation into and subsequent existence as an immortal genii who is forced to obey the Master who calls him. Over centuries, Azriel becomes less obedient to the Masters and a warning is placed on the casket of his bones that he is not to be summoned lest his evil be loosed upon the undeserving world. After many centuries of rest, Azriel finds himself awake and in New York City, a dazed witness to the murder of a young woman, Esther Belkin. He becomes inexplicably obsessed with the desire to avenge her death and to find out who called him into the physical world in time to see Esther die but not in time to save her. This quest leads him to the girl's stepfather, Gregory Belkin, who would pay any price to fulfill his messianic dream via his immense worldwide religious organization, the Temple of the Mind of God. As his quest approaches its climax, he risks his supernatural powers to forestall an attempt to destroy the world thus redeeming what was denied him for so long: his own eternal human soul.",
    " The story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947. Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old. Thursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him. Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenburg cake, has some curious house guests: Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos. Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them. Despite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues. She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the aging English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike. Thursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him. On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\"). Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday. Goliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO -- at their headquarters in the Isle of Man -- and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness. Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband. Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilize. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly. On top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final in order to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy). She succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.",
    " Up to this time Cornwell had been going back through the period of the Napoleonic Wars to find new incidents into which to place his hero. Rather than do this, he adopts a \"prequel\" approach and uses an earlier campaign period in the history of the British Army, that of colonial India. The novel opens with Richard Sharpe serving as a private with the British army, then invading Mysore and advancing on the Tippoo Sultan's capital city of Seringapatam. Sharpe is contemplating desertion with his paramour, widow Mary Bickerstaff. His sadistic company sergeant, Obadiah Hakeswill, deliberately provokes Sharpe into attacking him, and engineers the virtual death sentence of 2,000 lashes for the private. But Sharpe is rescued by Lieutenant William Lawford after 200 lashes are inflicted, in order to effect a rescue mission behind the Tippoo's lines. Lawford and Sharpe are ordered to pose as deserters to rescue Colonel Hector McCandless, chief of the British East India Company's intelligence service. Although Lawford is nominally in command, Sharpe quickly dominates the lieutenant by force of personality and, without authorization, brings Mary on the mission. Joining the Tippoo's army, they discover that the Tippoo has set a trap for the invading British by mining the weakest (and thus most inviting) portion of Seringapatam's walls. Before Sharpe and Lawford can discover a way to transmit a warning to the British, they are betrayed by Sergeant Hakeswill. Hakeswill has been captured in battle and the Tippoo orders him made a human sacrifice for victory, but Hakeswill secures the Sultan's mercy in exchange for revealing Sharpe's and Lawford's identity as spies. Sharpe and Lawford are imprisoned as the British army prepares to assault the booby-trapped wall of the city. Mary helps Sharpe to escape, and Sharpe blows up the mine before the main British army can enter the trap. As the Tippoo tries to flee the city, Sharpe finds him in a dark tunnel, kills him, and steals his rich jewels. Sharpe throws Hakeswill to the Tippoo's tigers, but the recently fed animals ignore Hakeswill, and Sharpe's enemy survives to plague him in later adventures.",

    " On Abarrach, Xar is attempting to learn the secret of necromancy, but he needs a corpse to test it on. He interrogates the lazar Kleitus about the location of any living Sartan, and Kleitus reveals that Haplo lied to Xar about all the Sartan dying at the hands of the dead; Balthazar and his group remain living. Kleitus drops a hint about the Seventh Gate, and reveals that it's where the Sundering took place and that Haplo's corpse would know its location. Xar dismisses this idea, as well as the lazar, and is quickly becoming obsessed with the Seventh Gate when receives word that two Sartan have been captured: Zifnab, for one, whose pleas on Haplo's behalf go unheeded; and, as quite a prize, Samah, ruler of the Council of Seven. Xar is initially excited since Samah is the very person who would know the Seventh Gate's location, and he interrogates Samah for it to no avail. Sang-drax&mdash; the one who actually captured Samah and Zifnab&mdash; is summoned by Xar to mentally torture Samah to death; even before he dies, Samah does not reveal anything useful. Xar succeeds in turning him into a far-more-complacent lazar, but too much of Samah's will remains, and he still won't talk. Even worse, when Xar turns his back to investigate Zifnab's disappearance, Jonathan walks in and teaches Samah how to let go; the leader of the Council of Seven is now well and truly dead. Xar is soon told by Sang-drax of Haplo's \"treachery\"; he has helped the mensch start the Kicksey-winsey and given control of Arianus over to the mensch, instead of reserving it for Xar himself. Party to this conversation is the loyal servant who informed Xar of the capture and has already been ordered to investigate the Arianus situation: Marit, the woman Haplo loved, the mother of his child. Xar marries her in traditional Patryn fashion of rune-joining, both to ensure her loyalty and because it gives them an unblockable way to communicate, and then orders her to kill Haplo. Haplo rests on Arianus and tries to heal his heart-rune, a job that truly needs two people (most rune-healing is accomplished by \"circling\" and allowing strength from one person to flow to the other.) Prince Rees'ahn and King Stephen's deputy, the wizard Trian, have come to Drevlin to talk with High Froman Limbeck Bolttightener in the hopes of hammering out some sort of true alliance between all three races of mensch (the mysteriarchs having folded into the human race after their leader Sinistrad's death.) Haplo gives the Kenkari book to Limbeck, and the three races together reactivate the Kicksey-winsey, which realigns the scattered islands of Arianus and starts a constant flow of water through the sky. Then Haplo enters his dragonship and prepares to leave for the last time. Hugh, under contract to kill Haplo, retraces his own steps. He goes from the Cathedral of the Albedo back to the Fortress of the Brotherhood, where Ciang gives him a cursed knife: ugly, badly made, capable of self-movement... and covered in Sartan runes. It is the only weapon the Brotherhood has that might even possibly be capable of killing Haplo. As payment for it, Ciang orders him to never return or further payment will be taken in his blood. Hugh, in the end, doesn't even use his new Cursed Blade&mdash; its main advantage, suppressing Haplo's warning runes and a good amount of his magic, allows Hugh to sneak up on him in his ship and capture him, but the tables turn and Hugh accidentally ends up with Haplo's knife in his gut... only to lurch back from the grave, Alfred's necromancy rune having evidently condemned him to eternal life. Haplo circles with Hugh to calm the human's distress at returning from the dead yet again, and the two begin to plan how to find Alfred when they are interrupted. Marit appears and fights both Haplo and Hugh. The first time they engage their Patryn rune-magic, however, the Cursed Blade reacts, transmuting itself into various threats, and the three break off their conflict periodically to quiet it down (they can't really make it stop;) they also struggle over the ship's steering-stone. Eventually Haplo takes the ship to Chelestra, hoping to douse the Cursed Blade in seawater, but the knife, instead of transforming into another weapon or creature, summons a dragon-snake that destroys the ship. As Haplo drifts in the sea, he hears a voice and looks up to see... Alfred. At Sang-drax's misleading suggestion, Xar has gone to Pryan with the pretext of taming the tytans, and he is frustrated with his inability to reach Marit. His real reason for being there is his hope of finding the Seventh Gate in the citadel that Haplo visited, but he finds little to encourage him. The five mensch&mdash; Paithan, Rega, Aleatha, Roland, and Drugar&mdash; aren't much help, nor is Zifnab, who has somehow gotten here after escaping from Abarrach. Shortly after Xar and Zifnab have arrived, Sang-drax says he knows now that Zifnab is \"one of them;\" after a battle with Zifnab's dragon, he takes on Xar's form and steals the ship, claiming that he will search for Haplo while Xar is on Pryan. It is revealed during Xar's stay that Zifnab is actually one of the dissenting Sartan who refused to go along with Samah's plan; he was among the mensch on Earth during the Sundering, and was the first of either race to escape the Labyrinth. It was he who penned many of the books Xar educated himself with. (With all that Zifnab has seen, his total dementia seems a bit more understandable.) Xar decides to leave Pryan in a ship he spotted outside the citadel, covered in Sartan runes, but to do that he needs to get past the tytans. He decides to need to kill off the mensch and revive them with necromancy to serve as distractions. The mensch are having their own problems. Paithan is obsessed with a room in the center of the citadel that he calls the Star Chamber, a room with seven huge seats and an apparatus that generates blinding light. Roland and Aleatha are mostly not on speaking terms; the elf maiden finds herself spending more time with Drugar, who may be the last of his race. But Drugar has discovered a delightful illusion: at a certain clearing in the garden maze, at certain times of the day, he can see ghostly shadows of people from all the mensch races, walking around and talking to each other. Aleatha is there when he uses his amulet to activate the platform, teleporting him instantly to a different citadel&mdash; where, as it turns out, there are other survivors. Marit finds herself in a Sartan prison. On a bench in the middle of the room, Haplo recovers from injuries caused by the Cursed Blade. Across from it, Hugh the Hand and the dog watch her with unblinking eyes. Their \"jailer\": none other than Alfred, who rescued them from Chelestra. After some discussion, Haplo realizes that they are in the Vortex, the one-way gate at the very center of the Labyrinth. It was here that the Patryns were initially imprisoned and chose to live for generations, until people calling themselves Nexus runners started trying to escape. (It's unknown when they abandoned the Vortex and all moved out into the Labyrinth.) Haplo decides to enter the Labyrinth in search of his daughter, whom Marit named Rue. Hugh agrees to go with him, as does Marit at Xar's command; he has told Marit to hold off on killing Haplo to report back any conversations Alfred and Haplo have about the other worlds. It is only Alfred who balks. He has nothing left&mdash; Orla \"saw\" Samah's death and chose a peaceful death to be with him&mdash; but fear of the unknown. The Labyrinth itself, however, refuses to let him return to the Vortex by unceremoniously dropping a mountain on top of the exit back into it. To Haplo, the Labyrinth seems afraid of Alfred, though he can't for the life of him figure out why; what is Alfred, besides a bumbling, useless Sartan? ...who can turn into a dragon and bring people back from the dead? The group is about to be overrun by tiger-men when, surprisingly, a Patryn raiding party comes to save them. This party comes from Abri, the one and only city inside the Labyrinth (anathema to the lone-wolf Patryns). While camping overnight, Alfred admits his true name to Haplo: Coren, a Sartan word that can mean \"to choose\" or perhaps \"chosen.\" Many Sartan children were named that, in hopes of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but (as Haplo points out) Alfred did not feel particularly amused when he awoke, the last living Sartan on Arianus. Clearly Alfred was Coren, was chosen&mdash;but for what? Marit, however, betrays them by revealing that Alfred is a Sartan. Haplo, Hugh, and Alfred are jailed by the city's leader, Headman Vasu, to await Lord Xar&mdash; Marit accused Haplo of being a traitor and plotting against their people&mdash; but are freed again just as quickly after Marit overhears the disguised Sang-drax plotting to kill them. Sang-drax and his cronies are also gathering a huge army of the Labyrinth's native monsters, with which to destroy the city of Abri and seal the Final Gate; they allowed Marit to overhear them to feed off the emotions that would come from it. Abri's occupants prepare for its defense, while Haplo and Marit, prodded by the dog, finally find their love for each other. Alfred feels out of place; though few seem to begrudge him his Sartan heritage, he is still out-of-place here, a clumsy pacifist in a city preparing for war. Talking with Headman Vasu, however, he eventually discovers that the city was not made by Patryns (who do not build cities,) or at least not by Patryns alone&mdash; the Sartan \"heretics\" who were expelled into the Labyrinth were accepted by the Patryns, eventually integrating completely into the society; Vasu himself is half-and-half, supplementing his Patryn tattoos with Sartan magic. The Patryns taught them the value of family; the Sartan, in return, taught the Patryns the value of banding together. Here, at the heart of the Labyrinth, rises Abri, the city that symbolizes the best in both cultures. Alfred also finds out why he is called the Serpent Mage: it is a title from a Sartan hierarchy of strength in magic, whose levels are named after animals. Serpent is very near the top. Alfred has found the meaning of his name: to choose his power, and all the responsibility it comes with... or to choose Alfred, who would rather faint than have to use his magic. Back on Pryan, Drugar returns from the other citadel with knowledge: he knows how to stop the tytans. Aleatha has fled the maze, though; pushed into hysterics by his sudden (and literal) disappearance, she ran back to her brother, and the four are now at a \"party\" of Xar's, at which he hopes to kill them with poisoned wine so that their bodies will be undamaged. Zifnab, however, saves them by drinking all of it himself and saying that it was poisoned, faking his death once again. The mensch are horrified at the revelation that Xar means to kill them. Aleatha escapes the room, while the other three are sealed inside by Xar... until Zifnab's dragon discovers Zifnab's \"death\" and tears the room apart. Aleatha has fled once again into the maze, where Xar can't pursue her because of protective Sartan runes covering its path. She runs into Drugar and he tells her they have to let the tytans inside to help them; he shares with her how to stop them. They run for the gates, but before they can reach it, Xar attacks; Drugar sacrifices himself to save Aleatha. Xar is about to kill Aleatha when the dragon strikes, distracting Xar with battling it instead of killing mensch. The other mensch have escaped from the destroyed room and find her, and they think she's mad when she tells them what she's going to do. She uses the amulet to open the gate and invites the tytans inside; they peacefully enter and ask, &mdash;Where is the citadel? to which Aleatha answers, \"Here is the Citadel. You are home.\" Xar recovers from his battle with the dragon, and prepares to leave for the Labyrinth after Marit reports back to him&mdash; apparently corrupted by Haplo's influence into thinking Xar has made a mistake in allying with the dragon-snakes, as she says they are planning an attack. He is surprised when the tytans don't kill the mensch, and actually act to protect the mensch from him, but he avoids a fight by snatching Drugar's amulet from Aleatha and running away with it. The amulet will gain him entry into the Sartan ship, which he can then use to return to the Labyrinth. At Abri, the battle between Patryns and Labyrinth creatures rages fiercely, but the real threat comes from the dragon-snakes. Haplo, Marit, and Hugh lead a sortie to deal with them, and the three battle Sang-drax in his serpent form. Sang-drax is apparently killed by Haplo, but Haplo has been badly injured and almost crushed beneath the massive body. Marit is attacked by a wolfen when a green and golden dragon carries it away: Alfred, having made his choice to accept his power. He lifts the serpent's body off of Haplo, leaving Marit to hold his blood-soaked form, his heart-rune's wound having reopened. But while Alfred is distracted in battle with the dragon-snakes, Xar appears. He wants Haplo's knowledge of the Chamber of the Damned, and will stop at nothing to get it. The battle ends with the Labyrinth's armies driven off, but Marit dazed and wounded, Haplo abducted by Xar, and Alfred missing in action.",
    " The Eight features two intertwined storylines set centuries apart. The first takes place in 1972 and follows American computer expert Catherine “Cat” Velis as she is sent to Algeria for a special assignment. The second is set in 1790 and revolves around Mireille, a novice nun at Montglane Abbey. The fates of both characters are intertwined as they try to unravel the mystery behind the Montglane Service, a chess set that holds the key to a game of unlimited power. A gift from the Moors to Emperor Charlemagne, these pieces have been hunted fervently throughout the years by those seeking ultimate control. In the throes of the French Revolution, Mireille and her cousin Valentine must help in dispersing the pieces of the chess set to keep them out of the wrong hands. However, when Valentine is brutally murdered in Reign of Terror, Mireille is thrown into the midst of men and women who would pursue power at any cost, including Napoleon, Robespierre, Talleyrand, Catherine the Great, and more. She comes to realize she must rely on her own intuition and tenacity to accomplish her goal. In 1972, Cat Velis faces a similar atmosphere of conspiracy, assassination and betrayal. When she is requested by an antique dealer to recover the chess pieces, she unwittingly enters into a mysterious game that will endanger her life. As she learns the story of the Montglane Service, she begins to realize that players of the Game may plan their moves, but their very existence makes them pawns as well.",

    " In his \"Preliminary Discourse\", Barruel defines the three forms of conspiracy as the \"conspiracy of impiety\" against God and Christianity, the \"conspiracy of rebellion\" against kings and monarchs, and \"the conspiracy of anarchy\" against society in general. He sees the end of the 18th century as \"one continuous chain of cunning, art, and seduction\" intended to bring about the \"overthrow of the altar, the ruin of the throne, and the dissolution of all civil society\". The first volume examines the anti-Christian conspiracy that was begun by Voltaire in 1728 when Barruel claimed that Voltaire \"consecrated his life to the annihilation of Christianity\". Barruel returned to the principal texts of the Enlightenment and found reasons to draw close links between the philosophism of the time and the anti-Christian campaigns of the Revolution. Here he found that the philosophes had created an age of pretend philosophy which they used in their battle with Christianity. Their commitment to liberty and equality were really commitments of \"pride and revolt\". Barruel claimed that the proponents of the Enlightenment led people into illusion and error and refers to the philosophes as \"Writers of this species, so far from enlightening the people, only contribute to lead them into the path of error\". He alleged that Voltaire, dAlembert, and Frederick II, the King of Prussia, planned the course of events that lead to the French Revolution. They began with an attack on the Church where a \"subterranean warfare of illusion, error, and darkness waged by the Sect\" attempted to destroy Christianity. The influence of the philosophes could not be underrated according to Barruel. They created the intellectual framework that put the conspiracy in motion and controlled the ideology of the secret societies. Barruel appears to have read the work of the philosophes and his direct and extensive quotes shows a deep knowledge of their beliefs. This is unusual among the enemies of the Enlightenment, who rarely distracted themselves by reading the works and authors they were attacking. Barruel believed the philosophes were important as the original villains that seduced the population and made Enlightenment, and subsequently revolutionary, ideals favorable. The second volume focuses on the anti-monarchical conspiracy that was led by Jean Jacques Rousseau and Baron de Montesquieu. These conspirators sought to destroy the established monarchies under the guise of \"Independence and Liberty\". Barruel analyses and criticizes Montesquieus The Spirit of Laws and Rousseaus Social Contract because the application of the ideas expressed in these books had \"given birth to that disquieted spirit which fought to investigate the rights of sovereignty, the extent of their authority, the pretended rights of the free man, and without which every subject is branded for a slave - and every king a despot\". He believed that the influence of these two writers was a necessary factor in the enactment of the French Revolution. He agreed with the revolutionaries as they themselves placed the remains of Voltaire and Rousseau in the Pantheon to pay homage to the \"fathers of the revolution\". Barruel believed that the philosophes had created a lasting influence as their spirit survived through their writings and continued to promote anti-monarchical feelings within the Jacobins and the revolutionaries. The destruction of monarchies in Europe led to the triumph of the Jacobins as they trampled \"underfoot the altars and the thrones in the name of that equality and that liberty which summon the peoples to the disasters of revolution and the horrors of anarchy\". Barruel equated the rejection on monarchy with a rejection of any type of order and government. As a result, the principles of equality and liberty and their attacks against the monarchy were attacks against all governments and civil society. He presented a choice to his readers between monarchy and the \"reign of anarchy and absolute independence\". Barruels third volume addresses the antisocial conspiracy that was the objective of the Freemasons and the Order of the Illuminati. The philosophes and their attacks against the church and the throne paved the way for the conspiracy that was led by these secret societies. These groups were believed to have constituted a single sect that numbered over 300,000 members who were \"all zealous for the Revolution, and all ready to rise at the first signal and to impart the shock to all others classes of the people\". Barruel surveyed the history of Masonry and maintained that its higher mysteries had always been of an atheist and republican cast. He believed the Freemasons kept their words and aims secret for many years but on August 12, 1792, two days after the fall of the French monarchy, they ran though the streets openly announcing their secrets. The secret words were \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity\" and the secret aim was the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the republic. Barruel claimed he heard them speak these words in France but that in other countries the Masons still kept their secrets. A division of the group into numerous lodges ensured that if the secrets of one lodge were discovered, the rest would remain hidden. He believed that it was his job to warn all governments and people of the goals of the Freemasons. Barruel described in detail how this system worked in the case of the Illuminati. Even after Johann Adam Weishaupt, the leader of the sect, was discovered and tried in court, the proceedings could not uncover the universal influence of the Illuminati and no steps were taken against the group. The majority of the secret societies could always survive and carry on their activities because of the organization of the group. The Illuminati, as a whole, functioned to radicalize the movement against the throne and altar and influenced more members of the population to subscribe to their hidden principles. They refined the secret structure that had been provided by the Masons basic framework. For Barruel, the final designs of the coalition of the philosophes, the Freemasons and the Illuminati were achieved by the Jacobins. These clubs were formed by \"the adepts of impiety, the adepts of rebellion, and the adepts of anarchy\" working together to implement their radical agenda. Their guiding philosophy and actions were the culmination of the conspiracy as they directly wanted to end the monarchy and the church. Barruel believed that the only difference between the Jacobins and their precursors was that the Jacobins actually brought down the church and the throne and were able to institute their basic beliefs and goals while their precursors only desired to do these things without much success. According to Barruel, the first major assault on the Enlightenment came during the French Revolution. In the minds of many, the Enlightenment was inextricably connected to the Revolution that followed. This presumed link resulted in an explosion of literature that was hostile to the Enlightenment. When the leaders of the Revolution canonized Voltaire and Rousseau and made the Enlightenment themes of reason, progress, anti-clericalism and emancipation central to their own revolutionary vocabulary, it created a link that meant any backlash against the Revolution would increase opposition to the Enlightenment. The advent of what Graeme Garrard has called the \"continuity thesis\" between the Enlightenment and the Revolution – the belief that they were connected in some intrinsic way, as cause and effect- proved damaging to the Enlightenment. For Barruel, the Revolution was not a spontaneous popular uprising expressing a long-suppressed general will. It was instead the consequence of a united minority group who used force, subterfuge and terror to impose their will on an innocent and unsuspecting population. Barruel believed that the Revolution was caused by Voltaire, Rousseau and the other philosophes who conspired with secret societies to destroy Catholicism and the monarchy in France. He argued that the writings of the philosophes had a great influence on those who would lead the Revolution and that Voltaire and his followers were responsible for the training of revolutionaries. It was from the followers of the philosophes \"that the revolutionary ministers Necker and Turgot started up; from this class arose those grand revolutionary agents, the Mirabeaux, Sieyes, Laclos, Condorcets; these revolutionary trumps, the Brissots, Champforts, Garats, Cheniers; those revolutionary butchers, the Carras, Frerons, Marats\". Within the Memoirs, Barruel alleged that Diderots Encyclopédie was a Masonic project. He believed that the written works of the philosophes penetrated all aspects of society and that this massive collection was of particular significance. The Encyclopédie was only the first step in philosophizing mankind and was necessary to spread the impious and anti-monarchical writings. This created a mass movement against the church and society. Barruel believed that the conspirators attempt to \"imbue the minds of the people with the spirit of insurrection and revolt\" and to promote radicalism within all members of society. This was believed to be the main reason behind the Encyclopédie as it was \"a vast emporium of all the sophisms, errors, or calumnies which had ever been invented against religion\". It contained \"the most profligate and impious productions of Voltaire, Diderot, Boulanger, La Mettrie, and of other Deists or Atheists of the age, and this under the specious pretence of enlightening ignorance\". Barruel believed the volumes of the Encyclopédie were valuable in controlling the minds of intellectuals and in creating a public opinion against Christianity and monarchy. Philosophism was a term used by Barruel within the Memoirs to refer to the pretend philosophy that the philosophes practiced. It was originally coined by Catholic opponents of the philosophes but was popularized by Barruel. It referred to the principles that were shared by philosophes, Freemasons, and Illuminati. Barruel defined philosophism as \"the error of every man who, judging of all things by the standard of his own reason, rejects in religious matters every authority that is not derived from the light of nature. It is the error of every man who denies the possibility of any mystery beyond the limits of reason if everyone who, discarding revelation in defence of the pretended rights of reason, Equality, and Liberty, seeks to subvert the whole fabric of the Christian religion\". The term had a lasting influence as by the end of the 18th century it had become a popular term of abuse used by conservative journals to refer to supporters of the Revolution. These journals accused those who practiced philosophism as having no principles or respect for authority. They were skeptics who failed to believe in the monarchy and the church and thus, had no principles. The use of the term became pervasive in the Anti-Jacobin Review and contributed to the belief in a connection between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and its supporters. Philosophism became a powerful tool of anti-revolutionary and anti-Jacobin rhetoric. Barruel identified a number of individuals who he believed played direct roles in the Enlightenment and the conspiracy against Christianity and the state. He identified Voltaire as the \"chief\", d’Alembert as the \"most subtle agent\", Frederick II as the \"protector and adviser\", and Diderot as its \"forlorn hope\". Voltaire was at the head of the conspiracy because he spent his time with the highest levels of European society. His attention and efforts were directed at kings and high ranking ministers. DAlembert worked behind the scenes and inside the more common areas of French society. He employed his skill in the cafes and academies and attempted to bring more followers to the conspiracy. Barruel takes a close look at the correspondence between Voltaire and dAlembert and uses this as evidence of their plot to overthrow society. He is deeply concerned with the fact that those he identifies as the leaders of the plot had secret names for one another in their private correspondence. Voltaire was \"Raton\", dAlembert was \"Protagoras\", Frederick was \"Luc\", and Diderot was known as \"Plato\". Barruel also argued that the conspiracy extended far beyond this small group of philosophes. He believed that the court of Louis XV was a \"Voltairean ministry\" of powerful men. This group involved Marquis dArgenson who \"formed the plan for the destruction of all religious orders in France\", the Duc de Choiseul who was \"the most impious and most despotic of ministers\", the \"friend and confidant of dAlembert\", Archbishop de Briennes, and Malesherbes, \"protector of the conspiracy\". According to Barruel, this group of influential leaders worked together with a number of adepts who supported the conspiracy. The most important adept that Barruel identifies is Condorcet. Barruel claimed that Condorcet was a Freemason and leading member of the Society of 1789 who was elected to the Legislative Assembly and was \"the most resolute atheist\". Condorcet was important because he embodied everything that Barruel claimed the conspiracy was. He was a Freemason that associated with the philospohes and who would become an influential member of the revolution process. Barruel also lists the Baron dHolbach, Buffon, La Mettrie, Raynal, Abbé Yvon, Abbé de Prades, Abbé Morrelet, La Harpe, Marmontel, Bergier and Duclos among the members of the \"synagogue of impiety\".",

    " In South Africa under apartheid, Mehring is a rich white businessman who is not satisfied with his life. His ex-wife has gone to America, his liberal son (who is probably gay) criticizes his conservative/capitalist ways and his lovers and colleagues do not seem actually interested in him. Out of a whim he buys a farm outside the city, afterwards trying to explain this purchase to himself as the search for a higher meaning in life. But it is clear that he knows next to nothing to farming, and that black workers run it - Mehring is simply an outsider, an intruder on the daily life of \"his\" farm. One day the black foreman, Jacobus, finds an unidentified dead body on the farm. Since the dead man is black, the police find no urgency to look into the case and simply bury the body on the spot where it was found. The idea of an unknown black man buried on his land begins to \"haunt\" Mehring. This has been interpreted as the influence of apartheid on the class of privileged white people who profit from it while ignoring its victims. A flood brings the body back to the surface; although the farm workers do not know the stranger, they now give him a proper burial as if he were a family member. There are hints that Mehring's own burial will be less emotional than this burial of a stranger. This can be interpreted to symbolize the white man's position in South Africa: although he \"owns\" the land on a piece of paper, the black natives have the actual claim on the land. it:Il conservatore",

When the company arrive in Brighton for a one-week run at the Theatre Royal, Flood is confident that he will be able to use his stay to get in touch with his estranged wife Jenny, who has filed for divorce and is now living with Roger Colborn, a local businessman, on the outskirts of the city. Flood is surprised to find that it is Jenny who contacts him first: She tells him she is being stalked and, as she believes that her husband is to blame for it, asks him to do something about it. This is how Flood meets Derek Oswin, the alleged stalker, an eccentric man his own age who, just like his deceased father and grandfather before him, worked for the Colborns' family business until its liquidation in 1989. It turns out Oswin has written a history of the company but so far has not found a publisher. Talking to Oswin and to other people he meets, either by chance or by design, Flood more and more gets the impression that Roger Colborn is a dangerous man who has something to hide, and that Jenny must be saved from the clutches of the Colborn family before it is too late. Thus, Flood's interest in the affairs of a now defunct company is fuelled by his desire to win back Jenny, so much so that his professional life is affected. Trying to dig up dirt on the Colborns, he is drawn into a quagmire of events he cannot make head or tail of and eventually misses an evening's performance without giving any notice. When, however, on the following day he finds his understudy&mdash;the man who saved his neck the previous night&mdash;dead in the streets of Brighton he realizes the seriousness of the situation. In the course of one week homes are broken into, evidence is stolen, several people die, family secrets are uncovered, and an inheritance is reclaimed. Justice triumphs in the end.",
    " Shortly before noon on Saturday October 21 of an unspecified year after 2012 (evident by mention of a faded bumper sticker for Barack Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign), the small Maine town of Chester's Mill is abruptly and gruesomely separated from the outside world by an invisible, semipermeable barrier of unknown origin. The immediate appearance of the barrier causes a number of injuries and fatalities, and traps former Army Captain Dale \"Barbie\" Barbara—who is trying to leave Chester's Mill—inside the town. Police Chief Howard \"Duke\" Perkins is soon killed when his pacemaker explodes after getting too close to the barrier. This removes the last significant opposition to James \"Big Jim\" Rennie, used car salesman and the town's Second Selectman. Big Jim exerts significant influence within Chester's Mill, and seizes the opportunity to use the barrier as part of a power play to take over the town. Big Jim appoints one of his cronies, the incompetent Peter Randolph, as the new Police Chief. He also begins expanding the ranks of the Chester's Mill Police with questionable candidates, including his son, Junior Rennie, and his friends. Junior has frequent migraines caused by an as-yet undiscovered brain tumor which has also begun affecting his mental state; unbeknownst to Big Jim, Junior was in the process of beating and strangling a girl to death when the barrier appeared, and has killed another girl by the time Rennie places him on the police force. Elsewhere in Chester's Mill, Julia Shumway, the editor of the local newspaper, is phoned by Colonel James O. Cox, who has her carry a message to Barbie to contact him. When he does, Cox requests that Barbie act as the government's liaison in an effort to bring down the Dome, as it has come to be known. Because of Barbie's talents as a former bomb factory hunter, Cox gives him the task of locating the source, which is believed to be inside the Dome. Cox is also able to foresee the small town political ramifications of such a situation. By virtue of a Presidential order, Barbie is reinstated in the US Military and promoted to full Colonel. Barbie is also presented with a decree granting him authority over the township. However, smalltown politics being what they are, this action is not well received by Big Jim and his misguided band of renegade police officers. As Big Jim covertly encourages and orchestrates unease and panic among the town to build up his grab for power, Barbie, Julia and a number of other townspeople attempt to stop things from spiraling out of control. After crossing Rennie's path on several occasions, Barbie is framed and arrested for 4 murders. He is accused of killing Reverend Lester Coggins, who laundered money for Rennie's large-scale methamphetamine operation, and Duke's widow Brenda Perkins, who were both murdered by Big Jim. While Barbie is in jail other residents track the source of the Dome to an abandoned farm, and the device is strongly indicated to be extraterrestrial in origin. The restrictions issued by Rennie become more severe and the police force grows more abusive, galvanizing the town and eventually leading some residents to break Barbie out of jail, killing Junior seconds before he can murder Barbie. The semi-organized resistance flees to the abandoned farm, where multiple people touch the strange object and experience visions. They not only conclude that the device was put in place by extraterrestrial \"leatherheads\" (so named for their appearance), but that specifically they are juveniles who have set up the Dome as a cruel form of entertainment, a sort of ant farm used to capture sentient beings and allow their captors to view everything that happens inside. On an organized \"Visitors Day\"—when people outside the Dome can meet at its edge with people within—Big Jim sends Randolph and a detachment of police to take back control of his former meth operation from Phil \"Chef\" Bushey, who is stopping Rennie from covering up the operation as well as hoarding the more than four-hundred tanks of propane stored there. Many are killed in the ensuing gunfight and Chef, who is mortally wounded, detonates a plastic explosive device he has placed in the meth production facility. The ensuing explosion, combined with the propane and meth-making chemicals, unleashes a toxic firestorm. More than a thousand of the town's residents are quickly incinerated on national television, leaving alive only the twenty-six survivors at the abandoned barn, an orphaned farm boy hiding in a potato cellar, and Big Jim and his informal aide-de-camp, Carter Thibodeau, in the town's fallout shelter. Big Jim and Thibodeau eventually turn on each other; Big Jim stabs and disembowels Thibodeau, only to die several hours later when hallucinations of the dead send him fleeing into the now-toxic environment outside. The survivors at the barn begin to slowly asphyxiate, despite efforts by the Army to force clean air through the walls of the Dome. Barbie and Julia go to the control device to beg their captors to release them. Julia is able to make contact with a single female leatherhead, no longer accompanied by her friends and thus not caught up in their peer pressure. After repeatedly expressing that they are real sentient beings with real \"little lives\", and by sharing a painful childhood incident with the adolescent alien, Julia convinces the leatherhead to have pity on them. The Dome raises up slowly and vanishes, allowing the toxic air to dissipate and finally freeing the town of Chester's Mill.",

It can be read simultaneously as an unusual, charming love story, a description of the political and social forces at work in 1920s Brazil, a somewhat satirical depiction of Latin American aspirations to \"modernity\", and a celebration of the local culture and pleasures of Bahia. The book was made into series for Brazilian television in 1960, in 1976 and again in 2012. A feature film of the novel was directed by Bruno Barreto in 1983. The feature version starred Sonia Braga as Gabriela and Marcello Mastroianni as Nacib, and featured original music by Antonio Carlos Jobim.",
    " As a restless high school athlete in a small, unnamed town in North Carolina, Jason Maddox, the book's narrator, has a sexual encounter with his popular girlfriend’s alcoholic mother. Rumors of the encounter circulate at school, and Jason’s girlfriend, distraught when she learns of them, attempts suicide. Jason, himself previously popular, is shunned by his classmates, including the one who started the rumors. Jason confronts and savagely beats that classmate, and in the aftermath, he's arrested, expelled from school, and all but disowned by his conservative, mortified parents. Taking a job as a house painter, Jason moves into an apartment complex where he befriends his new neighbor, Bernard “Peewee” Mash, an intellectually precocious fifteen-year-old who, like Jason, is a local pariah. Peewee introduces Jason to art, literature, and, most importantly, punk rock. He and Jason are particularly enamored of the Los Angeles punk band Rule of Thumb, which is led by a Berkeley-educated poet, Jim Cassady, whom Jason and Peewee both revere. Learning that Rule of Thumb will be performing at New York City’s CBGB, Jason quits his job in order to drive himself and Peewee to New York. After the show, they speak to Jim Cassady, who advises them to start a band. They immediately make plans to move to Manhattan, where they live on the Lower East Side, center of the New York punk scene. There, Peewee becomes increasingly difficult, at odds with Jason musically and envious of Jason’s sexual prowess. Alternately given to tantrums and sullen silences, Peewee is ousted from the band that he co-founded. He and Jason pursue music separately until, recognizing how much they miss each other, they reconcile and start a new band. The new band has a growing reputation for its explosive, destructive shows, which result in injuries to person and property alike. Banned from most local venues, the band begins touring the U.S., and in the midst of what will prove to be its final tour, Peewee is killed in a car crash, with Jason narrowly surviving. Devastated by the loss of Peewee, Jason decides he’s finished with music, and, using money from an insurance settlement, he produces and directs a film that takes him to Los Angeles, where he falls in love with an aspiring actress who is herself seeking a new life after fleeing the civil wars in her native Yugoslavia. The actress, Irina, is married to a wealthy Englishman who is happily unaware of her affair with Jason and, possibly, others prior, though Irina denies any previous affairs to Jason. Their stormy romance is addictive to Jason, who begs Irina to leave her husband for him. She repeatedly, and emptily, assures him she will. At a party one night, Jason meets another former punk who tells him that Jim Cassady has recently been spotted, homeless and panhandling on the streets of Hollywood. This is the first sighting of Cassady, as far as Jason knows, since Rule of Thumb disbanded in the early 80s. Jason has always been mystified and intrigued by Cassady’s disappearance, and, on the Internet, he reads of other alleged Cassady sightings. Determined to find Cassady, Jason discovers that he’s now living in a bleak Los Angeles suburb with his elderly, controlling mother. He shares some of his recent songs and poems with Jason, who thinks they're deserving of a wide audience. Except for Cassady's music and the advice he gave Jason and Peewee at CBGB almost twenty years before, Jason might still be miserable in North Carolina, and he means to express his gratitude by helping Cassady gain a new following. But Cassady is resigned to obscurity, and he grudgingly submits to Jason’s efforts on his behalf. Perhaps out of spite, he causes a rupture in Jason’s relationship with Irina, and Jason promises to kill him for it, only to reaffirm, in the book's epilogue, how indebted he is to Cassady, who has again changed the course of his life.",
    " As volunteers clean up after a huge outdoor rock concert in Yorkshire in 1969, they discover the body of a young woman wrapped in a sleeping bag. She has been brutally murdered. The detective assigned to the case, Stanley Chadwick, is a hard-headed, strait-laced veteran of the Second World War. He could not have less in common with - or less regard for - young, disrespectful, long-haired hippies, smoking marijuana and listening to the pulsing sounds of rock and roll. But he has a murder to solve, and it looks as if the victim was somehow associated with the up-and-coming psychedelic pastoral band the Mad Hatters. In the present, Inspector Alan Banks is investigating the murder of a freelance music journalist who was working on a feature about the Mad Hatters for MOJO magazine. This is not the first time that the Mad Hatters, now aging rock superstars, have been brushed by tragedy. Banks finds he has to delve into the past to find out exactly what hornets' nest the journalist inadvertently stirred up.",
    " Leonora Eyre, an attractive and elegant, but essentially selfish, middle-aged woman, becomes friendly with antique dealer Humphrey Boyce and his nephew James. Both men are attracted to Leonora, but Leonora prefers the young, good-looking James to the more \"suitable\" Humphrey. While James is away on a buying trip, Leonora discovers to her annoyance that he has been seeing Phoebe, a girl of his own age. Leonora makes use of Humphrey to humiliate Phoebe, and turns out a sitting tenant in order that James can take up a flat in her own house. She does this in an apparent attempt to control his life. While abroad, the bisexual James has begun a relationship with an American, the amoral Ned, who later follows him to London. Ned prises James out of Leonora's grasp, only to reject him for another lover. James attempts a reconciliation with Leonora, but she refuses to give him a second opportunity to hurt her, and settles for the admiration of the less attractive Humphrey. As with all Pym's fiction, the novel contains many literary references, notably to works by Keats, John Milton and Henry James.",
    " The story takes place in Montefiore, Italy in the early 16th century, on the estate of a nobleman named Don Vicente de Nevada. He lives there with his seven year old daughter, Bianca, and a small staff, the two most interesting of which are Primavera, an earthy cook and Fra Ludovico. In the beginning of the novel, de Nevada finds a mirror in a pond near his manor. This mirror was fashioned by dwarves but lost when they left it in the pond to temper. Incidentally, one dwarf spends most of the novel following de Nevada to ask the return of the mirror. Life is good for the family until the day Lucrezia Borgia and her brother, Cesare, decadent children of a pope, come to visit. Cesare sends Vincente on a quest for a holy relic. While he is gone, Bianca becomes a young woman and Lucrezia becomes jealous of the girl's beauty and stealing Cesare's attention from Lucrezia. Eventually she hires a woodsman to kill Bianca. The girl escapes, and runs into seven dwarfs, who are looking for the eighth dwarf and their mirror.",
    " The book describes the construction of an important bridge in Albanian territory at an ungiven time or age. Told by a catholic monk, Gjon (Gjon is a name used by Northern Albanians who were mostly catholic prior to Turkish invasions), the story of the bridge, as seen by Gjon is filled with prissy, unhappy bureaucrats, who take the events at face value without ever trying to understand the larger forces at work. Both the river Ujana e Keqe and the bridge itself are major characters in the book, and they undergo significant transformations. One of the startling events of the book is when a \"volunteer\" is immured inside the bridge in order to make a \"sacrifice\" to the river. The man's face is captured in the plaster that surrounds him, as unforgettable as it is horrifying. Though clearly a punishment for the crime of sabotage against the bridge, as Gjon recounts this event, it is less an act of vengeance than it is a true sacrifice. But more than that, it becomes a symbol for the ignorance of and squabbling among tiny Albanian principalities and their fight amongst one another, in front of a major threat.",
    " The novel describes a world set in the year 2048 after a catastrophe which has fractured the United States into several nations. The protagonists live in San Francisco and have evolved in the direction of Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy, using wind power, local agriculture, and the like. San Francisco is presented as a mostly pagan city where the streets have been torn up for gardens and streams, no one starves or is homeless, and the city's defense council consists primarily of nine elderly women who \"listen and dream\". The novel describes \"a utopia where women are leading societies but are doing so with the consent of men.\" To the south, though, an overtly-theocratic Christian fundamentalist nation has evolved and plans to wage war against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting utopia and dystopia against each other. The basic premise resembles that of Pat Murphy's earlier novel The City, Not Long After. The story is primarily told from the points of view of 98-year-old Maya, her nominal granddaughter Madrone, and her grandson Bird. Through these and other characters, the story explores many elements from ecofeminism and ecotopian fiction.",
    " Renn, a gifted but often bullied Eight Year novice in the Echorium who can speak to Half-Creatures, is asked to assist the Singers by translating for Shaiala Two-Hoof, a wild girl brought to the Island for treatment, who claims to have been raised by centaurs. Although initially the pair argue, meeting Rialle helps to calm Shaiala and she begins to remember, enough to reveal that her memories were wiped using a mask made of khiz. Second Singer Kherron takes this excuse to insist that Shaiala and Renn leave with him to search for Frazhin, the escaped khizpriest whose body was never found. After this revelation, Rialle takes Shaiala, who was very disturbed by her recolllections, and Renn to come to the cave where she lives and meet the merlee. While Shaiala swims with the merlee, Renn rejects their friendly offers and is horrified to learn that \"crazy\" Rialle is his mother. The next day, Renn and Shaiala leave with Kherron on the Wavesong, heading to Southport. On the journey, Renn is irritable and offends Shaiala by refusing to believe her tales of centaurs. Kherron also gives Shaiala a bluestone necklace. Upon arrival, the group begin to explore Southport and Shaiala, despite being closelyguarded by a pentad of orderlies including Frenn and Lazim, escapes, only to become lost in the rough part of the city. She is kidnapped and thrown in a cellar with several street children, and Erihan, the son of Lord Nahar, the leader of the Kalerei tribe of Horselords. The children are taken away by barge towards the Plains. While Kherron attempts to trace Shaiala through her bluestone necklace, they rapidly loose track of the barge. Meanwhile, the children meet \"Aunt Yashra\", a seemingly kindly pregnant woman who asks to hear each child sing, and then chooses some to return to her \"Singing Palace\" while others are to be \"gotten rid of\". This disturbs Shaiala, who recognises Yashra, and causes friction between the children, with many of those chosen wanting to stay. However, after three days of cramped conditions, they hatch a plan to escape. Shaiala kicks a hole in the side of the boat for the children to escape through, but several are left behind as the boat begins to sink, attracting the crew's attention. Shaiala and the other remaining children are taken to Aunt Yashra's camp, where Yashra uses the khiz mask to make them passive. Shaiala remembers the mask and, with Erihan's help, escapes. Shaiala and Erihan steal Yashra's horses and head onto the Plains together to search for tracks - Erihan for Horselord's, Shaiala for centaur's. Meanwhile, Renn is asked to track Shaiala's bluestone, as novices are more sensitive than Singers. Although they follow the barge for a few days, Renn is shocked when the bluestone is suddenly underwater, and he fears Shaiala has drowned. However, the bluestone is soon retrieved by a Half-Creature similar to a merlee, known as a naga. The Singers follow the naga upriver, and eventually arrange a meeting. The naga shows them its collection of 'sparklies' - consisting of Shaiala's bluestone, a piece of khiz and Erihan's dagger. Seeing Erihan's dagger, the Singers are attacked by Lord Nahar and the Kaleri, who have been following the Singers in their search for Erihan. After a brief confrontation, the two groups agree to work together, and the Horselords tell the Singers about the Sunless Valley, reachable only though the Pass of Silence, where they suspect the children have been taken. Renn contacts the naga again and, in exchange for the return of a 'sparkly', it tells them where it found the dagger - with Shaiala's bluestone - and where it found the khiz, in the mountains. However, it leaves before Renn can ask if it knows another way into the Sunless Valley. Meanwhile, Shaiala and Erihan eventually track down Shaiala's herd of centaurs by the Dancing Canyons. Seeing them, Shaiala remembers why no-one else had spotted them - the adults use herdstones to bend light around the herd, rendering it invisible. Shaiala offers to take herdstones to the centaur foals enslaved in the Sunless Valley, and she and Erihan travel there through underwater caves, guided by naga, within which they see khiz crystal poisoning the naga eggs. Meanwhile, the Singers attempt to get through the Pass of Silence, a pass so precarious that the slightest noise can start an avalanche. However, when they are attacked, Renn accidentally cries out, setting off an avalanche. Frenn and another orderly are killed, Kherron is captured, a crystal forced into his throat, and is taken away, and only Renn's quick thinking saves himself and the other orderlies from the second avalanche set off by the Harai guarding the Pass. Grateful, Lazim finally explains how Frazhin disappeared after the Battle of the Merlee twenty years ago, and, although those sent to find his body disappeared, he was not considered a threat after the khiz was destroyed. While the orderlies attempt to disable to gong used to set off avalanches in the Pass of Silence - thereby allowing Lord Nahar and the Kaleri to pass through safely - Renn hides, only to be caught by Yashra as she brings in the captured street children, and be taken to the Khizalace - Yashra's stronghold. However, there is trouble in the Valley - Shaiala and Erihan have arrived to find the captured centaurs working as slaves to mine khiz, and have freed them with herdstones, leading a revolution. The angry foals storm the palace, leaving Shaiala and Erihan no choice but to follow. They get inside the Khizalace, but are soon separated from the centaurs. Instead, they find a group of street children, apparently hypnotised, and follow them to their dormitory, which is dominated by the presence of a giant khiz crystal. Although the pair quickly disable the guards, they are unable to break the crystal's hold on the children, and only just keep from sucumbing themselves. Renn is taken to see Singer Kherron in the dungeons, who is clearly badly injured by the khiz crystal in his throat. Frazhin arrives, and attempts to force Kherron to teach the children in the Khizalace the Songs of Power, scorning the Singer's attempts to break free. Frazhin threatens that if Kherron does not help him, he will harm Renn - whom Frazhin believes to be Kherron's son. It is made clear in the conversation that Yashra's unborn child is Frazhin's. Renn is taken away, but escapes from his guards when he hears of a \"wild centaur girl\" causing havoc in the dormitories. He hurries to find Shaiala attempting to crack the khiz with her kicks, and helps her to crack the crystal and free the children. With the Khizalace shattering around them from the blow, the Harai flee, and Shaiala and Renn hurry to free Kherron, whose voice is badly damaged from the crystal, then join the battle outside. With the arrival of the Kaleri, the battle has turned in the Singer's favour, at least until Yashra appears and seals the gates against them with khiz power, trapping them inside. Although she seems victorious, capturing Erihan as a hostage and controlling the khiz against the Kaleri, she is distracted when Singer Kherron warns her to keep an eye on Frazhin, who is trying to escape without her. She hurries after him, and between Renn's singing and the centaur's kicks, the gates are destroyed. When the group catches up to Yashra, she is watching from the lakeshore as Frazhin on a boat in the centaur calls to the naga. Although they help him initially, they suddenly turn on him and pull him under the water. Yashra, trapped by the Singers, is offered a choice: immediate execution or life on the Echorium until her child is born followed by a course of Yehn. She chooses the Echorium, for the sake of her child, and protests before she is taken away that Frazhin's crimes are the Singer's fault, for destroying his hopes of joining them when he was a child. After leaving the valley, Shaiala and Renn forget their earlier disagreements, and with Renn's singing to assist her, Shaiala successfully cracks rock to find her own herdstone. A songless Kherron, after reporting to the Echorium with Renn's help, admits that, while he would be glad to call himself Renn's father, Rialle had a close relationship with Frenn - who Renn was named for - and Renn's parentage is uncertain. Shaiala joins the Kaleri to learn to be a tribeswoman from Erihan's mother, and Renn returns to the Echorium, where he reconciles with Rialle and the merlee.",
    " The Hunter, an alien lifeform (when not inside another being, resembling a four-pound green jellyfish) with the ability to live in symbiosis with and within another creature, is in hot pursuit of another of his kind. Both crash their ships into Earth, in the Pacific Ocean, and both survive the crashes. The Hunter makes its way to shore (its erstwhile host having been killed in the crash) and takes up residence in the nearest human being it can find (as it turns out, fifteen-year-old Robert Kinnaird) without letting the human being know. By the time it has figured out enough of what goes on inside a human being to look through Bob's eyes, it is shocked to find itself within an air vessel, being carried further away from its quarry every second. As it happens, Bob is simply returning to a New England boarding school from his home on an industrial island in the Western Pacific. Once Bob arrives at school, the Hunter sees no alternative to communicating with his host. After initial attempts produce panic in the boy, the Hunter eventually finds a way to convince Bob of his presence. Bob is very accepting of his guest, perhaps beyond what would be expected of a teenage boy who learns another entity is inside him, observing his every move. The two plot a way to return home. The puzzle distracts Bob from his studies, leading to a decline in grades that the school authorities ascribe to homesickness, and he is sent home for the remainder of the term. Upon arrival, the two begin to seek out their quarry. Bob is injured by an accident. The Hunter is able to hold the wound together, but he can't stop Bob from limping, and Bob is sent to the island doctor. They see no alternative to confiding in the doctor (the Hunter is forced to show his own form to convince the man) and the doctor becomes an ally in their search. Which of the many humans on the island is the host to their quarry? It is worse than a needle in a haystack (thus the title) because a needle at least looks like a needle, not a piece of straw. The Hunter is able to solve the riddle by observing the behavior of the island people. Bob's father, known for his attention to detail and safety, has been taking amazing risks. He is at least unconsciously aware that an accident will have no ill consequences. The quarry resides within him. The Hunter confirms this, and Bob and the alien have a new puzzle—how to get the alien out of Mr. Kinnaird's body without harming the man? This time, Bob comes up with the solution. He places himself in the middle of a large number of (empty) oil cans, uses a little actual oil to start a small fire, making it look like there will be a huge explosion shortly, and calls his father for help. The fugitive alien, fearful of being killed in the explosion, knocks out his host and removes himself from Mr. Kinnaird's unconscious body. As soon as the alien is a few feet away from Bob's father, the boy grabs the one full oil can, races over to the alien, pours oil over it, and lights it on fire. He then tends to his father. Mr. Kinnaird is fine, but Bob is worried. He and the Hunter had better come up with a good story for the man, or the Hunter will have to find some way to assuage the pain of a spanking.",

    " The story involves a widow named Minna Shaw. One evening, a witch falls from her broom when it loses the ability to fly and lands in the garden near Minna Shaw's house. Minna Shaw takes her in until she recovers, and when she does, the witch calls a friend to \"drive\" her home, leaving her own broom behind. Minna Shaw discovers the broom is still in her house and leaves it alone but is startled, and more than a little afraid, when it comes to life later that evening. She discovers that the broom is harmless, as all it does is sweep, but she teaches it how to feed the chickens, chop wood, and play the piano. While most of the neighbor women and children are comfortable with the broom, the men are concerned that it had been a witch's broom. Shortly afterwards, two boys begin to harass it. The broom, apparently angered, beats them and flings their dog over the forest. The boys' parents demand that the broom be burned at the stake. Minna Shaw surprisingly agrees, and the broom is burned. Things appear normal until the broom's phantom-white ghost begins stalking the Spiveys' house. The Spiveys are so terrified that they pack up and leave the house. Minna Shaw can now be alone and listen to the broom play the piano; she'd given the Spiveys her own ordinary household broom to burn and cooked up the plan for the magical broom (which was just painted white), to scare her neighbors away. She painted it white to make it look like the \"ghost\" broom.",
    " During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands Anne Frank began to keep a diary on June 14, 1942, two days after her 13th birthday, and twenty two days before going into hiding with her mother Edith Frank, father Otto Frank, sister Margot Frank and three other people, Hermann van Pels, Auguste van Pels, and Peter van Pels. The group went into hiding in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex of her father's office building in Amsterdam. The sealed-off upper-rooms also contained a hidden door behind which the Franks would hide during the parts when Nazi soldiers were investigating the buildings for harbored Jews. Mrs. van Pels' dentist, Fritz Pfeffer, joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: the van Pels are known as the Van Daans and Fritz Pfeffer is known as Mr. Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month, until their betrayal in August 1944, which resulted in their deportation to Nazi concentration camps. Of the group of eight, only Otto Frank survived the war. Anne died in Bergen-Belsen from a typhus infection in early March, shortly (about two weeks) before liberation by British troops in April 1945.",
    " Jake spends a day having strange flashbacks of himself in a rainforest, which leaves him disturbed. That evening, after watching a boxing match with his brother and father, he leaves for a grocery store, where Tobias has discovered something has crashed and the high-ranking yeerks are trying to hide something. The other Animorphs join them, and together they infiltrate the store in fly morph. Cassie overhears Chapman saying that it was a Yeerk bug fighter. After Ax manages to reconfigure the ship's controls, the Animorphs escape, pursued by Chapman and the other Yeerks. They plan to fly the spacecraft to Washington, in order to convince the American government that Earth is under attack by extraterrestrials. When Ax discovers that the fighter's technology to keep human radar from seeing it is broken, they are intercepted by two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets, however, Cassie notices that they are over the Red Sea in the Middle East - far from their intended destination. Flying above the atmosphere, they are picked up by Visser Three's Blade ship sensors. The Animorphs, knowing they can't escape, try to fire on the Visser's vessel. Both Jake and the Blade ship fire their Dracon beams at the same time, and, coincidentally, their projectiles intersect, and both ships crash. The kids wake up in their wrecked Bug fighter. They look around, noticing that they've crash-landed in a rainforest. They assume they're in the Amazon rainforest, but are also disturbed by the fact that it is the middle of the day (whereas it was nighttime in the United States, which is in roughly the same time zone as South America). After Jake reveals the strange flashbacks he was having, Ax speculates they may have caused a \"Sario Rip\" and traveled twelve hours backwards through time, which would explain why Jake was having strange flashbacks: he was in two places at once, and the two Jakes---the \"past\" and \"future\" versions---experience each other's thoughts at random moments. However, Cassie later notices that only Jake has the flashes so Ax says that Jake is the only \"real\" person-the rest are just a memory. They soon find that the Yeerks have traveled backwards through time as well, and will need both ships to create another Sario Rip and return to the right time. Ax takes the Bug fighter's computer to prevent them from doing so, and the group ventures out into the hostile wilderness, constantly plagued by insects, fire ants, snakes and piranhas. They're pursued by the Yeerks, who ruthlessly destroy the animals and trees around them in a bid to kill the Animorphs, desperate to retrieve the precious computer. The children acquire jaguar and monkey morphs in order to traverse the rainforest more easily. They eventually stumble across a group of Amazon Indians, led by Polo, their tribal chief. Marco, who knows some Spanish, manages to roughly translate the natives' Portuguese, and Jake and Polo agree to assist one another in eliminating the Yeerks. Polo and his men kill the Hork-Bajir guarding the Blade ship with poison-tipped spears, leaving the Animorphs with Visser Three, who morphs an amphibian-like Lerdethak and picks the Animorphs off one by one. Jake morphs into a monkey to use the Ledethak's vine like arms to move himself to Visser Three's body. He then throws a poison-tipped spear into Visser Three: while never revealed, this may have been fatal. Regardless, Visser Three is still able to use an arm to break Jake's neck. However, Jake wakes up back at the grocery store, just as they are about to infiltrate it. He calls off the operation, and the Animorphs all go home. The next day Jake asks Ax what had happened. Ax postulates that the travel through time created two separate versions of Jake. The reason Jake simply \"woke up\" back at the grocery store was that the Jake in the rainforest died at the hands of Visser Three; since it is impossible for one consciousness to exist in two separate locations, when one was eliminated the two snapped back together. Ax also speculates that Jake had to die, or else both Jakes and both their universes would collide and cease to exist. The events in the rainforest never actually happened (including the acquisition of jaguar and monkey morphs), and only remain in Jake's memory. He is left with a feeling of chilling relief. *Sario Rips are introduced and explained.",

Figuring that it will reincarnate him if he changes it to plus and jumps in, he does so. It is left to the reader to decide whether Connor and Scrote were reincarnated or were fully annihilated.",
    " Count von Count and other Muppets are returning from a country drive in the Countmobile. But, in classic suspense/horror movie fashion, the bridge is out, so the group has to spend the night at a spooky old house. A giant monster butler escorts each character to a room, decorated entirely in one of the seven colors of the rainbow. No one is especially gruntled by their accommodations: Cookie Monster longs for a green cookie to go well with his green room, while the Count von Count does not like his red room (not one little bit of it), Ernie is not too thrilled with his purple room, Oscar the Grouch finds himself trapped in a bright pink room, filled with flowers and hearts, while Bert longs for a beige room over an orange one, Betty Lou is blinded by yellow, and even Grover finds himself depressed by his matching blue room. The group rapidly depart the next morning, happy to leave the weird house and return. The Sesame Street residents are unaware that the House of Seven Colors is in fact a tourist attraction, frequented by vast car and busloads of monsters who feel right at home in rooms that match their fur.",
    " The novel is narrated by Alexias, a noble Athenian youth, who becomes a noted beauty in the city and a champion runner. The novel suggests that young male Athenians were treated almost like modern debutantes and wooed by older men seeking to be their lovers; in fact, in a memorable passage, Alexias' father, Myron, himself a former beauty and champion athlete, writes to his son before leaving Athens for the Sicilian Expedition. The father imparts to the son the traits he should seek in a lover – qualities like honor, loyalty and courage. However, the father also warns the son not to become involved with women as he is much too young. (See Athenian pederasty.) The book implies that Myron had been Alcibiades' lover when the latter was a teenager, and felt that the way that Alcibiades turned out was at partly Myron's fault at least, as it was his responsibility as a lover to teach his eromenos virtue. As an Ephebe (adolescent male), Alexias falls in love with Lysis, a man in his 20s – a champion pankratiast and a student of Socrates. The novel follows their the relationship through the Peloponnesian War, the surrender of Athens, the establishment of the Thirty Tyrants rule over Athens, the democratic rebellion of Thrasybulus and shortly after. The story ends with first hints of the eventual trial of Socrates for teaching blasphemy and sowing social disorder. From the beginning of the novel, Socrates figures prominently; both Alexis and Lysis become his students in their youth. Also characterized in the novel are Plato and several figures from his Dialogues who were Socrates' students, including Xenophon. Another historical figure who figures in the story, albeit mostly off-stage, is Alcibiades, the Athenian general who flees Athens on a charge of sacrilege and functions as a military adviser to Sparta until he is recalled by a resurgent democracy in Athens. Alexis and Lysis serve under Alcibiades' command until his carelessness leads the fleet to disaster and he once again goes into exile. In the course of the novel, Lysis falls in love with and marries a woman who sees Alexias favorably and encourages the continuation of her husband's relationship with him. Not long after this, Athens is defeated by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Alexias' father is murdered under the Spartan-installed tyranny, and he and Lysis go into exile in Thebes joining Thrasybulus when he leads the next democratic revolt. Lysis is killed in the battle between the Long Walls running from the port of Piraeus to Athens (the Battle of Munychia). Shortly after the victory, Alexias takes Lysis' widow under his protection, marries her and continues his family line. The book ends with the postscript that this story (incomplete and long-forgotten) has been found by Alexias' grandson (also named Alexias), a commander of Athenian cavalry in the service of Alexander the Great.",

    " Jango begins with Seeker, Morning Star and Wildman who are all being taught in the Nom and are near the end of their training. Their teacher, Chance, mentions the secret skill of a Noble Warrior, and tells them a new teacher will be assigned to them to help them attain this secret skill. He then hands them over to Miriander, who puts them through training to learn how to control another's will by using lir. Once this training is over, it is discovered that Seeker has power without limits. Unlike the other Noble Warriors, he is able to suck the lir out of any living thing and doesn't get weary doing so. He fights and defeats Chance. Afterwards, he is told to stay in one place while the Elder and the council of the Nomana decide what to do with him, as they feel that they should not loose such power in the world, yet he might be the one the save the Nomana. In the trees of the forest called the Glimmen lives Echo Kittle who is described as being pale, slender and beautiful. She is captured by the Orlan leader, Amroth Jahan, who intends to arrange a marriage between her and one of his sons. She refuses to do so until the Jahan threatens to burn down the Glimmen and kill everyone in it. She decides to go along with them and soon they arrive in Radiance, which is led by Soren Similin. After a series of events taking up more than half the book, Similin manages to form an alliance between the Jahan and Radiance so they can destroy Anacrea with the use of charged water, which has huge explosive power. Neither the Jahan or Radiance intends to share the victory with the other. In his cell, Seeker is told by a Noma, Narrow Path, that the council of the Nom has decided to cleanse Seeker. Narrow Path believes this is the wrong decision and, knowing that he himself will be cleansed for this act, sets Seeker free, and tells him that he must go and fight the true threat; the Savanters, whom live in the land cloud. Seeker heads off to the land cloud, which is on the opposite side of the Glimmen, and on the way there he meets Jango sitting by a strange door in a broken down wall. At first, Jango seems to be a crazy old man, until he begins citing many of Seeker's personal thoughts. He gives Seeker much cryptic advice on how to defeat the Savanters and cites Noman's famous quote. (see Noman's experiment). Seeker continues on his way through the Glimmen but is stopped by Echo Kittle who has escaped from the Orlans in Radiance. She pleads with Seeker to help her defend the Glimmen from the Orlans but Seeker, knowing that he has little time left, refuses and carries on his way into the land cloud. There he kills five out of seven savanters but he is told to go back by a black figure, pretending to be his shadow. Seeker feels that something bad is happening at the Nom so he runs back as fast as he can. When Seeker arrives back at the Nom, the army of Orlans has already attacked and the charged water bomb ready to blow up the city, although Seeker doesn't know this. Seeker drives his power into the ground, causing an earthquake that stopped the battle in an instant, but the charged water bomb had already been launched at Anacrea and destroyed it, along with the Garden and the Lost Child. Seeker gets angry and takes revenge on the Jahan by breaking his pride, forcing him to kneel to Echo Kittle. The army of Orlans breaks up and Soren Similin dies from a charged water explosion. Seeker heads out in search of a purpose and runs across Jango, who is standing before a door. Jango says the door is open and he can enter if he wishes. Before he enters, he is told by Jango that there are many more Noms, and so he realizes the All and Only is not dead. The book is ended when Seeker enters the strange door next to Jango and enters an exact replica of the Nom's Garden that he was used to. He kneels down and asks for forgiveness for disbelieving in him after the destruction of the Nom.",
    " Mixing history and legend, it presents a situation in which pagan and Christianized Basques unite under the first king of Navarre and ally with Pelayo, the first king of Asturias to defend Catholic Iberia against the invading hordes of Islam. Amaya is a Christian noblewoman, daughter of a Basque woman and Ranimiro, the ruthless Visigoth general. She is a niece to pagan leader Amagoya, who prefers her other pagan niece as heiress to the secrets of Aitor, the Basque ancestral patriarch. Pacomio is a machinating Jew conspirating in disguise among Muslims, Visigoths and Basques. Eudes, duke of Cantabria, is Pacomio's son, but, by hiding his Jewish origin, has reached a high post in the Visigoth kingdom and aspires to power beyond what his allies and his father would allow. At the end, the secret of Aitor is revealed, to recommend Christianity, the pagan Basques (except for Amagoya) convert, and Amaya marries the Basque resistance leader, García, becoming the first monarchs of Navarre.

    " It is the story of a young Bengali man’s adventures in Africa in the years 1909-1910. Shankar, the protagonist, is a 20 year old man, recently graduated from college and about to take up a job in a jute mill, a prospect he absolutely loathes. He yearns for adventure, wild lands, forests and animals. He wants to follow the footsteps of famous explorers like Livingstone, Mungo Park, Marco Polo, all of whom he has read about and idolizes. By a stroke of luck, he secures a job as a clerk in Uganda Railways through a fellow villager already working there and goes to Africa without a second thought. There, he spends a few months laying rail tracks but soon encounters the first of many dangers of Pre-World War I Africa—man-eating lions. Later he takes up a job as station master in desolate station. Here he encounters the another hazard in Africa: the poisonous black mamba. He also rescues and looks after the middle-aged Portuguese explorer and gold prospector, Diego Alvarez. The encounter with Alavarez influences him deeply. Alavarez tells him of his earlier exploits and adventures, how he and his companion Jim Carter had braved deep jungles and mountains of Richtersveld to find the largest diamond mine. However, they were thwarted by the legendary Bunyip, a mythical monster which guards the mines which killed Carter. Shankar gives up his job and accompanies Alvarez as he decides to venture out once more and find the mines again. They meet with innumerable hardships, a raging volcano being the greatest challenge. Eventually they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by a mysterious monster, the same that had taken Carter’s life, the Bunyip. Shankar sets out to reach civilization. He finds the Bunyip's cave and the diamond mines by accident. He enters the cave but eventually gets lost. With great difficulty, he gets out, marking his way with \"pebbles\" and taking some back with him as memento, not knowing each is a piece of uncut diamond. He finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave he found earlier really was the diamond mine. Gatti, as Shankar learns from a note by him, had uncut diamonds in his boots. The note said that whoever reads the note can take the diamonds as long as he buries his skeleton, with Christian rites. Shankar does so, and keeps the old diamonds. He becomes lost in the deserts of Kalahari and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately he is rescued by a survey team, and taken to a hospital in Salisbury, Rhodesia, from where he sets sail for home. He ends the book saying that he will return to that cave one day with a large team, and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter and Gatti.",
    "Robert De Niro has completed a transatlantic box office double by topping the UK and US film charts with two different films at the same time.\nComedy sequel Meet the Fockers, in which he stars with Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, shot to the top of the UK chart at the weekend. It took £7.2m in three days - eight times more than the number two, Closer. Assault on Precinct 13 was in third. At the same time, US audiences were won over by his new thriller Hide and Seek. In Meet the Fockers, he picks up the role of an uptight father and ex-CIA agent from 2000 hit comedy, Meet the Parents.\nIt is a big leap to his role in Hide and Seek, a supernatural horror in which he plays a widower whose daughter's imaginary friend turns nasty. In the UK box office chart, Meet the Fockers pushed Closer off the top spot while police action movie Assault On Precinct 13, starring rapper Ja Rule, made £750,000 in its first weekend. London Underground thriller Creep was another new entry at six while quirky comedy Sideways, which got five Oscar nominations last week, entered in eighth place. The Oscar nominations do not seem to have had an impact on fans' choices at cinemas. Leading contenders The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Ray all suffered substantial drops in takings compared with the previous weekend.",
    "The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy (DOE) lab. DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The current top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocks up 35.86. Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.\nThe US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the Linpack benchmark. Until the official list is published, however, Blue Gene/L's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time.\nThe IBM Blue Gene/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005. Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance. This was achieved during internal testing at IBM's production facility in Rochester, Minnesota, though, so was not an official record. Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California. It would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October.\nSupercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis. IBM's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing. This means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second. \"When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world,\" Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.\n\"You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative.\" One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing - and Blue Gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding. \"Health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures. \"We are a great believer in simulation. It gives you another tool,\" he said. Once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. Compared with the current fastest supercomputers, Blue Gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.\nContrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon's Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"",
    "The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.\nCommission officials are to look at Rome's provision of a 400m euro ($495m; £275m) loan to the carrier. Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. The investigation could take up to 18 months. However, Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible. \"The Italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan,\" said Mr Barot. \"We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. I would like our analysis to be completed swiftly.\"\nThe matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. It plans to split into AZ Fly and AZ Services, which will handle air and ground services respectively. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. EU rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the \"one time, last time\" rule for airlines. Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. The airline declined to comment on the Commission decision.",
    "Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.\nThe Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be \"limited\". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and \"add-ons\" that the software giant offers.\nPeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.\nMicrosoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. \"It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,\" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. \"China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,\" said Mr Cluley.",
    "The debut of US television hit Desperate Housewives has helped lift Channel 4's January audience share by 12% compared to last year.\nOther successes such as Celebrity Big Brother and The Simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass BBC2 for the first month since last July. However the channel's share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with January 2004. Celebrity Big Brother attracted less viewers than its 2002 series.\nComedy drama Desperate Housewives managed to pull in five million viewers at one point during its run to date, attracting a quarter of the television audience. The two main television channels, BBC1 and ITV1, have both seen their monthly audience share decline in a year on year comparison for January, while Five's proportion remained the same at a slender 6.3%. Digital multi-channel TV is continuing to be the strongest area of growth, with the BBC reporting Freeview box ownership of five million, including one million sales in the last portion of 2004. Its share of the audience soared by 20% in January 2005 compared with last year, and currently stands at an average of 28.6%.",
    "Video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.\nGamers spent more than £1.34bn in 2004, almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the UK gaming industry's trade body. Sales records were smashed by the top title of the year GTA: San Andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character CJ into a crime boss. The game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. This feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the UK. Although only released in November the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. There were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies. Five titles, including Sony EyeToy Play and EA's Need for Speed: Underground 2, managed this feat according to figures compiled by Chart-Track for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (Elspa). Electronic Arts, the world's biggest games publisher, had 9 games in the top 20.\n2004 was a \"stellar year\" said Roger Bennett, director general of Elspa. \"In a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,\" he said. Part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. Halo, The Sims, Driver, Need for Speed, Fifa football, Burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. Despite this fondness for older games, Doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. Movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. Games linked to Shrek, The Incredibles, Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were all in the top 20. Elspa noted that sales of Xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. However, Sony's PlayStation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the £1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. Despite winning awards and rave reviews Half-Life 2 did not appear in the list. This was because it was only released on PC and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers. Also the novel distribution system adopted by developer Valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. Valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.",

    "French president Jacques Chirac has called the UK's £3bn rebate from the European Union \"unjustified\".\nSpeaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. He said it remained justified because less EU farm money came to the UK.\nMr Chirac told reporters in Brussels: \"One can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the British cheque. It can no longer be justified. It was from the past.\" But a UK Government official responded: \"Even with the rebate, the UK pays two and a half times more than France contributes to the EU budget. Without it we would pay 14 times as much as France. \"There can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.\"\nThe 25-member EU is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's Luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a June summit. Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a \"crucial test\" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain. EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.\nThe UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: \"I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.\n\"The UK is already one of the biggest net contributors to the EU .\" The foreign secretary meanwhile said the \"justice\" of the rebate remained. \"We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. \"That continues to be the case.\"\nUK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was \"set in stone\" and there was no reason to negotiate about it. \"It is extraordinary to do it at this time, just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the EU. If we lose our rebate as well, the British taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that I think everyone will go off the European project.\" EU leaders are holding talks in Brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish European economy. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is meeting his EU counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the European Constitution. The plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections. There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.\nMr Straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. \"European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,\" he said. \"What we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.\" Britain's low unemployment meant there was less \"neurosis\" about people coming from eastern European countries. \"In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in,\" he said.",
    "China lent Russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.\nThe Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk's former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\nThe embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country's richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China's thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it's a good deal for them too.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "(after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)\nJohn Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunez's header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after Mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.\nRiise could not have connected any better with Morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampard's powerfully-struck drive and Drogba's low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence.\nJoe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsen's header, then to smother William Gallas' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted Mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. Dudek saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, Drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from Glen Johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.\nDudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore (Biscan 67), Luis Garcia, Gerrard, Hamann, Riise, Kewell (Nunez 56), Morientes (Baros 74).\nSubs Not Used: Pellegrino, Carson.\nHyypia, Traore, Hamann, Carragher.\nRiise 1, Nunez 113.\nCech, Paulo Ferreira, Ricardo Carvalho, Terry, Gallas (Kezman 74), Jarosik (Gudjohnsen 45), Lampard, Makelele, Cole (Johnson 81), Drogba, Duff.\nSubs Not Used: Pidgeley, Tiago.\nLampard, Kezman, Drogba, Duff.\nGerrard 79 og, Drogba 107, Kezman 112.\n78,000\nS Bennett (Kent).",
    "The Conservative Party would deal \"sympathetically\" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.\nDr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for \"vindictiveness\" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.\nA jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.\nHe won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. \"I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. \"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.\"\nTory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. \"After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,\" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: \"I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial.\" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.",
    "Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced.\nEighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. \"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,\" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices.\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on midnight of 31 December. Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.",

    "Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday.

    "Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq in the wake of next Sunday's elections in the country, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\nIn a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of George W Bush, Mr Kennedy said Iraq had become a \"crucible of militant terrorism\". He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops \"as soon as the situation allows\", he said in London. Any exit strategy must \"augment and support\" the democratic process.\n\"There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,\" he said. \"There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.\" Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal \"regardless of the situation on the ground\".\nHe accused Mr Blair's government of \"being less than straightforward\" over its plans. \"Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,\" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech. \"He should set out a proper exit strategy, including the phased withdrawal of British troops, as the security situation allows.\" Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - \"especially Islamic countries\".",
    "Amelie Mauresmo and Maria Sharapova won their opening matches at the Tour Championships in Los Angeles.\nFrance's Mauresmo routed Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-0, while Wimbledon champion Sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. American Serena Williams also won, edging Russian Elena Dementieva 7-6 7-5 for her second victory of the event. The event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.\nMauresmo's win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot. Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front. \"Since then, I feel very confident on court and my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but it's very different than before I was number one. \"It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way.\" Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia's Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\n\"She got mad a little bit and I played some great tennis,\" said Mauresmo, who was runner-up to Kim Clijsters in last year's final. Zvonareva has lost both her games so far, having crashed 6-2 6-4 Kuznetsova in the Staples Centre on Wednesday. \"Sometimes not everything works,\" she said. \"It was lots of pressure. Maybe that is why I couldn't do 100%. But I was fighting.\" Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: \"In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. \"This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.\" The tournament debutant added: \"I love it here. The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It's hard to go out there and get it right but I'm fighting and I'm hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort.

Money raised will go to the Fondation pour l'Enfance (Foundation for Childhood) which aims to rebuild a children's shelter in Sri Lanka. Sir Elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his wife Anne-Aymone.

    "A Labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the Royal Family the same rights as males.\nThe legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the Crown. It would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. But the government refused to back Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill, saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.\nThe Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, agreed the 1701 Act of Settlement, which governs the succession, was discriminatory but added that \"for all practical purposes its effects are limited\".\nThe changes proposed by Lord Dubs were a \"complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues\", he said. Lord Falconer said there were 22 members of the Royal Family in the line of succession after the Prince of Wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. \"It is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. While we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn't the proper form,\" he added.\nHe did not rule out change in the future but said if Lord Dubs' private member's bill was passed by peers, he would urge MPs to oppose it in the Commons. Lord Dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the House of Lords, but urged the government to think again at a later stage. \"We cannot forever say we don't want to change things because it is too difficult,\" he told peers. During the debate, the Labour peer and former minister said: \"The monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. \"What we don't want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. \"We are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against Catholics.\" But opponents of the bill, including Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway and the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, said it would separate the state from both the Church of England and the Christian faith. Such a \"secular\" state would be markedly \"less tolerant\", Rt Rev Scott-Joynt argued.",
    "The UK' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election. Here's a guide to the plan:\nPeople coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of TB, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the European Union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.\nTuberculosis, Hepatitis B and HIV. A positive test for TB would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.\nPeople would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS. They would also, if appropriate, have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.\nPeople coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB. Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV.\nThe Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health. However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.\nThey claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. They also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into Britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. They say the plans will protect access to the NHS.\nApplicants will be tested in their home country. Only asylum seekers will be tested in the UK once their refugee status is established.\nHome Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries. Recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at Heathrow Airport and 10,000 at Gatwick. From those tests, about 100 infectious cases of TB were found.\nThe Tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. The party has looked at the way the system is operated in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Tory proposals are \"quite closely modelled\" on the New Zealand system.\nLabour claims the policy is little more than a \"desperate attempt to catch up with Labour's five-year plan\" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. This says health screening for TB will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. The Liberal Democrats have warned Labour and the Tories they were \"in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it\".",
    "Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.\nLG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card's plastic for purchases.\nLG Card's creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.\n\"Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,\" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm's major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants \"fair and reasonable guidelines\" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. \"LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,\" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.\nLG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. \"Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,\" said Mr Kim.",
    "Plans to portray Dominica's Carib Indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film Pirates of the Caribbean have been criticised by the group's chief.\nCarib Chief Charles Williams said talks with Disney's producers revealed there was \"a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed\". The Caribbean island's government said Disney planned to film in Dominica. The Caribs have long denied their ancestors practised cannibalism. Disney was unavailable for comment. \"Our ancestors stood up against early European conquerors and because they stood up...we were labelled savages and cannibals up to today,\" said Mr Williams.\n\"This cannot be perpetuated in movies.\" Shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in April, with hundreds of Dominicans applying to be extras in the movie.\nAbout 3,000 Caribs live on the island of Dominica, which has a population of 70,000. Many Caribs were killed by disease and war during colonisation up to the 1600s. Mr Williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film. But he admitted there were some members of the Carib council who did not support the campaign. He said some did not \"understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the Carib people\".

She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.\n\"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,\" White said in the LA Times. \"Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product.\" White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case. The 27-year-old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning. \"I have no clue what it's going to take to change that,\" said White. \"I would say I made a mistake and I would never, ever go back. \"I would never recommend anyone to take that route.\"",
    "Tony Blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on Monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 May.\nThe date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. Over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day Mr Blair would go for an historic third term. And the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. The prime minister and his campaign boss Alan Milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between Labour's stability and investment against Tory cuts and boom and bust.\nAnd Chancellor Gordon Brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in Westminster - to underline that economic message. And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.\nDuring the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labour's plans was a cut. And it looked like the Labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by Mr Howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger \"cuts\".\nHe was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track. A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again. Mr Brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. As usual, the Liberal Democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. But leader Charles Kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. Other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on Iraq, law and order and education, for example. But, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. And, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001's non-event.",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "Celtic's Neil Lennon admits Rangers could be considered \"slight favourites\" for the Old Firm CIS Cup clash, but insists his side can still win.\nLennon concedes Rangers are in good form at the moment, but they have failed to beat Celtic in their last seven meetings. \"Rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks,\" he said. \"But it's a game we believe we're capable of winning if we play our best,\" he told the Evening Times. \"All the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in. \"Without playing at the top of our game, we have still been winning matches. \"At the minute, we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in Europe, so I don't think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out. \"Of course, it is a concern when you are losing goals, because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets, but hopefully we are over that wee run. \"Considering we lost Henrik Larsson at the end of last season, we have still been scoring a lot of goals, which is pleasing.\"",
    "US retail giant Federated Department Stores is to buy rival May Department Stores for $11bn (£5.7bn).\nThe deal will bring together famous stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's, creating the largest department store chain in the US. The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn. The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's - will assume $6bn of May's debt, bringing the deal's total value to $17bn. Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.\nMay has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart. Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.\n\"We have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in America, creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence,\" said Terry Lundgren, Federated's chairman. Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May. \"Without this deal May would have been, to put it bluntly, washed up,\" said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May's yearly sales are $14.4bn.",
    "Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.\nBrian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination. But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O'Neill's first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would \"desperately like to stay at Celtic\" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.\nThe agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old's father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho's father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. \"I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn't want to go there,\" said Hassel. \"He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic.\" Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. \"It was a thought at one stage,\" he said. \"If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. \"He is a fan of Kevin Keegan's style of play. It would not be a bad move for him.\" Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: \"The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened. \"If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. \"If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes.\" The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O'Neill since his move to Celtic Park. \"I can't understand why I am in this situation,\" he continued. \"When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support.\"",
    "Oscar-winner Andrea Arnold has been congratulated by the UK Film Council, the organisation which partly funded her project.\nArnold's film Wasp won the best live action short film award on Sunday. \"The UK Film Council spends millions of pounds of lottery investment on short filmmaking in Britain every year,\" said chief executive officer John Woodward. \"It certainly pays off when you see new film-makers winning such prestigious awards,\" he added.\nWasp, which was commissioned by the Film Council and Channel 4, beat films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar to the prize. It stars actress Nathalie Press, who appeared in the Bafta-winning drama My Summer Of Love, as a single mother who is forced to take drastic action when she is invited on a date and is unable to find a babysitter to look after her four daughters. The film has already won over 30 other international awards including the Sundance Short Film Prize. Arnold, from Dartford in Kent, described her victory as \"truly overwhelming. I'm really not used to this kind of thing,\" she said, after receiving her Oscar from actor Jeremy Irons. \"Thanks to everyone who worked on this - the beers are on me when we get home.\" The director was one of only two British winners on the night, the other being Sandy Powell, who won the costume design Oscar for her work on The Aviator.",
    "The last film to be made by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, called 06/05, has been premiered in The Hague.\nMembers of Van Gogh's family and celebrities attended the screening of 06/05, based on the murder of the anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam six weeks ago. A Dutch-Moroccan man suspected of radical Islamist links has been charged. The killing, and Fortuyn's death in 2002, convulsed the Netherlands. Many Dutch people have questioned their country's self-image as a peaceful, tolerant nation in the wake of the murders, which triggered heated debate about immigration.\nAn animal rights activist was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year for killing Fortuyn. Earlier this year, Van Gogh made a film accusing Islam of promoting violence against women. It caused outrage among Muslims and death threats were made against him. The film 06/05 will become available on the internet on Wednesday and go on general release in Dutch cinemas in January. Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician. The story unfolds through the eyes of a freelance photographer who unwittingly takes pictures revealing the involvement of Dutch authorities in Fortuyn's murder. Photographer Jim de Booy then goes on the run from secret service agents who burgle his home and threaten his family.",
    "The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\nThe Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.",
    "The world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.\nThe Wolong Nature Reserve in the Sichuan Province of southwest China is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world. A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. The data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. The reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.\nUsing the network, vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival.\n\"Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world,\" said Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong Nature Reserve. \"Our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings.\" The network has been developed by Intel, working closely with the staff at Wolong. It includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.\nBefore the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park, staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. Infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. To foster cultural links across the globe, a children's learning lab has been incorporated in the network, in collaboration with Globio (Federation for Global Biodiversity Education for Children), an international non-profit organisation. It will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in Portland, Oregon in the US. \"Digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world,\" said Globio founder Gerry Ellis.",
    "The shape of the UK's economy In graphics\nBut he denied that he was ruling out British membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year. Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future. Otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of China, he told MPs.\nThe chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.\nUnder Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules \"make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure\". But he argued that the EU was moving in the direction of the UK principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. Under Mr Brown's \"sustainable investment\" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.\nMr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified £3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only £6bn. Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter. But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was \"impugning the integrity\" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. Mr Brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost Treasury coffers.\nEarlier, ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more \"rigid\" rules. But fellow Tory David Heathcoat-Amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run Europe's varied economies on one set of rules. \"The essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake,\" he said. \"The warning is about the European constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. It gives more powers to Brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy.\" But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. \"The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,\" Mr. Brown said.",
    "A call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labour's most senior Asians.\nShahid Malik, who is on Labour's ruling NEC, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.\nMr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. \"If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,\" he said. He added: \"It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn't have a minority candidate.\" Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.\nBut he argued: \"I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.\" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as \"painful\". \"I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn't worked,\" she said. \"The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people.\" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation. \"We haven't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,\" he said.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "The stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End.\nSir Cameron Mackintosh's lavish production, which has cost £9m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress Laura Michelle Kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny's trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musical's premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.\nThe show's director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.",
    "A British author has had the film rights to her children's bestseller snapped up for a seven-figure sum, with Ridley Scott set to direct.\nMichelle Paver's Wolf Brother, a fantasy set 6,000 years ago, is the first in a planned series of six books. Film studio Fox has bought the rights for around $4m (£2.13m) for Scott's company Scott Free to develop. The director said he was \"thrilled\" with the project. \"Wolf Brother is an enchanting book,\" he said. Paver, who lives in London and previously worked as a lawyer, began writing the book in 1982 while studying biochemistry at Oxford University.\nShe was an established author of love stories when she turned the work-in-progress into a children's novel. It was published in 2004, with Paver earning an advance of $5m (£2.8m) - the highest sum ever paid for a debut children's book. Wolf Brother tells the story of Torak, a 12-year-old hunter who lives in the forest. After his father is killed he teams up with a wolf cub and sets out to rid the forest of an evil force. Paver is currently writing the second book in the series. \"Michelle Paver lives and breathes the worlds she writes about,\" said a spokesman for the author. \"I've told her about the film deal but at the moment she is writing the second book and her mind is 6000 years away deep in the primeval forest.\"",
    "The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit.\nAnalysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. However, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\nThe dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.\nDisappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected. \"There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday,\" said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel. At the same time, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. Investors will now look towards February's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in London for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar's decline.",
    "The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US.\nNew Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine.\nIn a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April.",

Get Me Out of Here drew an average of 10.9m viewers - about four million fewer than the previous series.\nThe fourth series of the show peaked on Monday at 11.9m and 49.2% of the audience, just before Joe Pasquale won. This compared with a peak of 15.3m at and a record 62.2% of the TV audience when Kerry McFadden won in February. Comic Pasquale beat former Royal butler Paul Burrell who came second, nightclub owner Fran Cosgrave, who was third. Pasquale follows Kerry McFadden, Phil Tufnell and Tony Blackburn as winners of the show.\nSinger and TV presenter McFadden was the show's first female winner. When cricketer Phil Tufnell won in May 2003, 12.3 million people - 50% of the viewing public - tuned in to watch. And when Tony Blackburn won the first show in 2002, 10.9 million people saw the show. Pasquale had been the show's hottest ever favourite to win, and its hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, known as Ant and Dec, said Monday's deciding vote was the closest in the programme's history.\nPascuale has been flooded with offers of TV work, according to his management company, but one of his first jobs on his return is pantomime.\nBefore joining I'm a Celebrity, he had signed up to play Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk in Birmingham, and tickets for the show have become increasingly popular since he joined the TV show.

The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.",
    "An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries.\nArash Sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online \"day of action\" to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger, Motjaba Saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests, is still being held.\nA spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as \"harsh\" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. \"The authorities are trying to make an example of him,\" the organisation said in a statement.\n\"By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media.\" In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the BBC Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court \"illegal and incompetent\" and called for a retrial in a public court.\nMr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world.\nThe Committee to Protect Bloggers designated 22 February 2005 as Free Mojtaba and Arash Day. Around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. About 12% of users were based in Iran, the campaign's director told the BBC News website. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. \"The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi's sentence, not less. \"The mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.\"",
    "Newcastle manager Graeme Souness is closing in on signing Chelsea defender Celestine Babayaro when the transfer window reopens.\nSouness is bidding to bolster his defence and, according to reports, contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player. Babayaro has been in the Premiership since 1997 when he moved to Chelsea for £2.25m from Anderlecht. But the 26-year-old has been surplus to requirements this season. Souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players.\nBut he said: \"All I can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals. \"We have said from day one we want to strengthen, and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks.\"",
    "In a sign of a thaw in relations between Egypt and Israel, the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the US, allowing Egyptian goods made in partnership with Israeli firms free access to American markets.\nThe protocol, signed in Cairo, will establish what are called \"qualified industrial zones\" in Egypt. Products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the US, provided that 35% of their components are the product of Israeli-Egyptian cooperation. The US describes this as the most important economic agreement between Egypt and Israel in two decades.\nThe protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. There has been deep sensitivity in Egypt about any form of co-operation with Israel as long as its peace process with the Palestinians remains blocked. But in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. Both exchanged prisoners earlier this month, with Egypt handing back an Israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak has described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as the best chance for the Palestinians to achieve peace. The government in Cairo now believes Mr Sharon is moving towards the centre and away from the positions of right wing groups. It also believes the US, pressed by Europe, is now more willing to engage seriously in the search for a settlement. But there are also pressing economic reasons for Egypt's decision to enter into the trade agreement. It will give a huge boost to Egyptian textile exports, which are about to suffer a drop after new regulations come into force in the US at the beginning of the year.",
    "Life insurer Axa Sun Life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors.\nRegular annual bonus rates on former Axa Equity & Law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. Axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. The cut will hit an estimated 3% of Axa's policyholders. The rest will know their fate in March.\nThe cuts on Axa's policies will mean a policyholder who had invested £50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of £46,998. This equated to a annual investment growth rate of 8% Axa said. With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. However, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. \"The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,\" Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News. Axa cut payouts for the same investors last January.",

Awake,\nMy fairest, my espoused, my latest found,\nHeaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!\nAwake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field\nCalls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring\nOur tender plants, how blows the citron grove,\nWhat drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,\nHow nature paints her colours, how the bee\nSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.\nSuch whispering waked her, but with startled eye\nOn Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.\nO sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,\nMy glory, my perfection! glad I see\nThy face, and morn returned; for I this night\n(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,\nIf dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,\nWorks of day past, or morrow's next design,\nBut of offence and trouble, which my mind\nKnew never till this irksome night:  Methought,\nClose at mine ear one called me forth to walk\nWith gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said,\n'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,\n'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields\n'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake\n'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns\n'Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light\n'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,\n'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,\n'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?\n'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment\n'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.'\nI rose as at thy call, but found thee not;\nTo find thee I directed then my walk;\nAnd on, methought, alone I passed through ways\nThat brought me on a sudden to the tree\nOf interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,\nMuch fairer to my fancy than by day:\nAnd, as I wondering looked, beside it stood\nOne shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven\nBy us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled\nAmbrosia; on that tree he also gazed;\nAnd 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged,\n'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,\n'Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?\n'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?\n'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold\n'Longer thy offered good; why else set here?\nThis said, he paused not, but with venturous arm\nHe plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled\nAt such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:\nBut he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine,\n'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,\n'Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit\n'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:\n'And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more\n'Communicated, more abundant grows,\n'The author not impaired, but honoured more?\n'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!\n'Partake thou also; happy though thou art,\n'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:\n'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods\n'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,\n'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes\n'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see\n'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!'\nSo saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,\nEven to my mouth of that same fruit held part\nWhich he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell\nSo quickened appetite, that I, methought,\nCould not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds\nWith him I flew, and underneath beheld\nThe earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide\nAnd various:  Wondering at my flight and change\nTo this high exaltation; suddenly\nMy guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,\nAnd fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked\nTo find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night\nRelated, and thus Adam answered sad.\nBest image of myself, and dearer half,\nThe trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep\nAffects me equally; nor can I like\nThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;\nYet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,\nCreated pure.  But know that in the soul\nAre many lesser faculties, that serve\nReason as chief; among these Fancy next\nHer office holds; of all external things\nWhich the five watchful senses represent,\nShe forms imaginations, aery shapes,\nWhich Reason, joining or disjoining, frames\nAll what we affirm or what deny, and call\nOur knowledge or opinion; then retires\nInto her private cell, when nature rests.\nOft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes\nTo imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,\nWild work produces oft, and most in dreams;\nIll matching words and deeds long past or late.\nSome such resemblances, methinks, I find\nOf our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,\nBut with addition strange; yet be not sad.\nEvil into the mind of God or Man\nMay come and go, so unreproved, and leave\nNo spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope\nThat what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,\nWaking thou never will consent to do.\nBe not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,\nThat wont to be more cheerful and serene,\nThan when fair morning first smiles on the world;\nAnd let us to our fresh employments rise\nAmong the groves, the fountains, and the flowers\nThat open now their choisest bosomed smells,\nReserved from night, and kept for thee in store.\nSo cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;\nBut silently a gentle tear let fall\nFrom either eye, and wiped them with her hair;\nTwo other precious drops that ready stood,\nEach in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell\nKissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse\nAnd pious awe, that feared to have offended.\nSo all was cleared, and to the field they haste.\nBut first, from under shady arborous roof\nSoon as they forth were come to open sight\nOf day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,\nWith wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,\nShot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,\nDiscovering in wide landskip all the east\nOf Paradise and Eden's happy plains,\nLowly they bowed adoring, and began\nTheir orisons, each morning duly paid\nIn various style; for neither various style\nNor holy rapture wanted they to praise\nTheir Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung\nUnmeditated; such prompt eloquence\nFlowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,\nMore tuneable than needed lute or harp\nTo add more sweetness; and they thus began.\nThese are thy glorious works, Parent of good,\nAlmighty!  Thine this universal frame,\nThus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!\nUnspeakable, who sitst above these heavens\nTo us invisible, or dimly seen\nIn these thy lowest works; yet these declare\nThy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.\nSpeak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,\nAngels; for ye behold him, and with songs\nAnd choral symphonies, day without night,\nCircle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven\nOn Earth join all ye Creatures to extol\nHim first, him last, him midst, and without end.\nFairest of stars, last in the train of night,\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn,\nSure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn\nWith thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,\nWhile day arises, that sweet hour of prime.\nThou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,\nAcknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise\nIn thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,\nAnd when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.\nMoon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,\nWith the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;\nAnd ye five other wandering Fires, that move\nIn mystick dance not without song, resound\nHis praise, who out of darkness called up light.\nAir, and ye Elements, the eldest birth\nOf Nature's womb, that in quaternion run\nPerpetual circle, multiform; and mix\nAnd nourish all things; let your ceaseless change\nVary to our great Maker still new praise.\nYe Mists and Exhalations, that now rise\nFrom hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,\nTill the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,\nIn honour to the world's great Author rise;\nWhether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,\nOr wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,\nRising or falling still advance his praise.\nHis praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,\nBreathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,\nWith every plant, in sign of worship wave.\nFountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,\nMelodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.\nJoin voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,\nThat singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,\nBear on your wings and in your notes his praise.\nYe that in waters glide, and ye that walk\nThe earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;\nWitness if I be silent, morn or even,\nTo hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,\nMade vocal by my song, and taught his praise.\nHail, universal Lord, be bounteous still\nTo give us only good; and if the night\nHave gathered aught of evil, or concealed,\nDisperse it, as now light dispels the dark!\nSo prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts\nFirm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.\nOn to their morning's rural work they haste,\nAmong sweet dews and flowers; where any row\nOf fruit-trees over-woody reached too far\nTheir pampered boughs, and needed hands to check\nFruitless embraces: or they led the vine\nTo wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines\nHer marriageable arms, and with him brings\nHer dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn\nHis barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld\nWith pity Heaven's high King, and to him called\nRaphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned\nTo travel with Tobias, and secured\nHis marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.\nRaphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth\nSatan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,\nHath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed\nThis night the human pair; how he designs\nIn them at once to ruin all mankind.\nGo therefore, half this day as friend with friend\nConverse with Adam, in what bower or shade\nThou findest him from the heat of noon retired,\nTo respite his day-labour with repast,\nOr with repose; and such discourse bring on,\nAs may advise him of his happy state,\nHappiness in his power left free to will,\nLeft to his own free will, his will though free,\nYet mutable; whence warn him to beware\nHe swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal\nHis danger, and from whom; what enemy,\nLate fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now\nThe fall of others from like state of bliss;\nBy violence? no, for that shall be withstood;\nBut by deceit and lies:  This let him know,\nLest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend\nSurprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.\nSo spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled\nAll justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint\nAfter his charge received; but from among\nThousand celestial Ardours, where he stood\nVeiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,\nFlew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,\nOn each hand parting, to his speed gave way\nThrough all the empyreal road; till, at the gate\nOf Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide\nOn golden hinges turning, as by work\nDivine the sovran Architect had framed.\nFrom hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,\nStar interposed, however small he sees,\nNot unconformed to other shining globes,\nEarth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned\nAbove all hills.  As when by night the glass\nOf Galileo, less assured, observes\nImagined lands and regions in the moon:\nOr pilot, from amidst the Cyclades\nDelos or Samos first appearing, kens\nA cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight\nHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\nSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing\nNow on the polar winds, then with quick fan\nWinnows the buxom air; till, within soar\nOf towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems\nA phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,\nWhen, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's\nBright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.\nAt once on the eastern cliff of Paradise\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\nA Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade\nHis lineaments divine; the pair that clad\nEach shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast\nWith regal ornament; the middle pair\nGirt like a starry zone his waist, and round\nSkirted his loins and thighs with downy gold\nAnd colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet\nShadowed from either heel with feathered mail,\nSky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood,\nAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled\nThe circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands\nOf Angels under watch; and to his state,\nAnd to his message high, in honour rise;\nFor on some message high they guessed him bound.\nTheir glittering tents he passed, and now is come\nInto the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,\nAnd flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;\nA wilderness of sweets; for Nature here\nWantoned as in her prime, and played at will\nHer virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,\nWild above rule or art, enormous bliss.\nHim through the spicy forest onward come\nAdam discerned, as in the door he sat\nOf his cool bower, while now the mounted sun\nShot down direct his fervid rays to warm\nEarth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:\nAnd Eve within, due at her hour prepared\nFor dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please\nTrue appetite, and not disrelish thirst\nOf nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,\nBerry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called.\nHaste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold\nEastward among those trees, what glorious shape\nComes this way moving; seems another morn\nRisen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven\nTo us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe\nThis day to be our guest.  But go with speed,\nAnd, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour\nAbundance, fit to honour and receive\nOur heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford\nOur givers their own gifts, and large bestow\nFrom large bestowed, where Nature multiplies\nHer fertile growth, and by disburthening grows\nMore fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.\nTo whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould,\nOf God inspired! small store will serve, where store,\nAll seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;\nSave what by frugal storing firmness gains\nTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:\nBut I will haste, and from each bough and brake,\nEach plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice\nTo entertain our Angel-guest, as he\nBeholding shall confess, that here on Earth\nGod hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.\nSo saying, with dispatchful looks in haste\nShe turns, on hospitable thoughts intent\nWhat choice to choose for delicacy best,\nWhat order, so contrived as not to mix\nTastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring\nTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change;\nBestirs her then, and from each tender stalk\nWhatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields\nIn India East or West, or middle shore\nIn Pontus or the Punick coast, or where\nAlcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat\nRough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,\nShe gathers, tribute large, and on the board\nHeaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape\nShe crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths\nFrom many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed\nShe tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold\nWants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground\nWith rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.\nMean while our primitive great sire, to meet\nHis God-like guest, walks forth, without more train\nAccompanied than with his own complete\nPerfections; in himself was all his state,\nMore solemn than the tedious pomp that waits\nOn princes, when their rich retinue long\nOf horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,\nDazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.\nNearer his presence Adam, though not awed,\nYet with submiss approach and reverence meek,\nAs to a superiour nature bowing low,\nThus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place\nNone can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;\nSince, by descending from the thrones above,\nThose happy places thou hast deigned a while\nTo want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us\nTwo only, who yet by sovran gift possess\nThis spacious ground, in yonder shady bower\nTo rest; and what the garden choicest bears\nTo sit and taste, till this meridian heat\nBe over, and the sun more cool decline.\nWhom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.\nAdam, I therefore came; nor art thou such\nCreated, or such place hast here to dwell,\nAs may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,\nTo visit thee; lead on then where thy bower\nO'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,\nI have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge\nThey came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,\nWith flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,\nUndecked save with herself, more lovely fair\nThan Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned\nOf three that in mount Ida naked strove,\nStood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil\nShe needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm\nAltered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail\nBestowed, the holy salutation used\nLong after to blest Mary, second Eve.\nHail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb\nShall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,\nThan with these various fruits the trees of God\nHave heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf\nTheir table was, and mossy seats had round,\nAnd on her ample square from side to side\nAll autumn piled, though spring and autumn here\nDanced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;\nNo fear lest dinner cool; when thus began\nOur author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste\nThese bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom\nAll perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,\nTo us for food and for delight hath caused\nThe earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps\nTo spiritual natures; only this I know,\nThat one celestial Father gives to all.\nTo whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives\n(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part\nSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be found\nNo ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure\nIntelligential substances require,\nAs doth your rational; and both contain\nWithin them every lower faculty\nOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,\nTasting concoct, digest, assimilate,\nAnd corporeal to incorporeal turn.\nFor know, whatever was created, needs\nTo be sustained and fed:  Of elements\nThe grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\nEarth and the sea feed air, the air those fires\nEthereal, and as lowest first the moon;\nWhence in her visage round those spots, unpurged\nVapours not yet into her substance turned.\nNor doth the moon no nourishment exhale\nFrom her moist continent to higher orbs.\nThe sun that light imparts to all, receives\nFrom all his alimental recompence\nIn humid exhalations, and at even\nSups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees\nOf life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines\nYield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn\nWe brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground\nCovered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here\nVaried his bounty so with new delights,\nAs may compare with Heaven; and to taste\nThink not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,\nAnd to their viands fell; nor seemingly\nThe Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss\nOf Theologians; but with keen dispatch\nOf real hunger, and concoctive heat\nTo transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires\nThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire\nOf sooty coal the empirick alchemist\nCan turn, or holds it possible to turn,\nMetals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,\nAs from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve\nMinistered naked, and their flowing cups\nWith pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence\nDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,\nThen had the sons of God excuse to have been\nEnamoured at that sight; but in those hearts\nLove unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy\nWas understood, the injured lover's hell.\nThus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,\nNot burdened nature, sudden mind arose\nIn Adam, not to let the occasion pass\nGiven him by this great conference to know\nOf things above his world, and of their being\nWho dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw\nTranscend his own so far; whose radiant forms,\nDivine effulgence, whose high power, so far\nExceeded human; and his wary speech\nThus to the empyreal minister he framed.\nInhabitant with God, now know I well\nThy favour, in this honour done to Man;\nUnder whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed\nTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,\nFood not of Angels, yet accepted so,\nAs that more willingly thou couldst not seem\nAt Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare\nTo whom the winged Hierarch replied.\nO Adam, One Almighty is, from whom\nAll things proceed, and up to him return,\nIf not depraved from good, created all\nSuch to perfection, one first matter all,\nEndued with various forms, various degrees\nOf substance, and, in things that live, of life;\nBut more refined, more spiritous, and pure,\nAs nearer to him placed, or nearer tending\nEach in their several active spheres assigned,\nTill body up to spirit work, in bounds\nProportioned to each kind.  So from the root\nSprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves\nMore aery, last the bright consummate flower\nSpirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,\nMan's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,\nTo vital spirits aspire, to animal,\nTo intellectual; give both life and sense,\nFancy and understanding; whence the soul\nReason receives, and reason is her being,\nDiscursive, or intuitive; discourse\nIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours,\nDiffering but in degree, of kind the same.\nWonder not then, what God for you saw good\nIf I refuse not, but convert, as you\nTo proper substance.  Time may come, when Men\nWith Angels may participate, and find\nNo inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;\nAnd from these corporal nutriments perhaps\nYour bodies may at last turn all to spirit,\nImproved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend\nEthereal, as we; or may, at choice,\nHere or in heavenly Paradises dwell;\nIf ye be found obedient, and retain\nUnalterably firm his love entire,\nWhose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy\nYour fill what happiness this happy state\nCan comprehend, incapable of more.\nTo whom the patriarch of mankind replied.\nO favourable Spirit, propitious guest,\nWell hast thou taught the way that might direct\nOur knowledge, and the scale of nature set\nFrom center to circumference; whereon,\nIn contemplation of created things,\nBy steps we may ascend to God.  But say,\nWhat meant that caution joined, If ye be found\nObedient?  Can we want obedience then\nTo him, or possibly his love desert,\nWho formed us from the dust and placed us here\nFull to the utmost measure of what bliss\nHuman desires can seek or apprehend?\nTo whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth,\nAttend!  That thou art happy, owe to God;\nThat thou continuest such, owe to thyself,\nThat is, to thy obedience; therein stand.\nThis was that caution given thee; be advised.\nGod made thee perfect, not immutable;\nAnd good he made thee, but to persevere\nHe left it in thy power; ordained thy will\nBy nature free, not over-ruled by fate\nInextricable, or strict necessity:\nOur voluntary service he requires,\nNot our necessitated; such with him\nFinds no acceptance, nor can find; for how\nCan hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve\nWilling or no, who will but what they must\nBy destiny, and can no other choose?\nMyself, and all the angelick host, that stand\nIn sight of God, enthroned, our happy state\nHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;\nOn other surety none:  Freely we serve,\nBecause we freely love, as in our will\nTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:\nAnd some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,\nAnd so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall\nFrom what high state of bliss, into what woe!\nTo whom our great progenitor.  Thy words\nAttentive, and with more delighted ear,\nDivine instructer, I have heard, than when\nCherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills\nAereal musick send:  Nor knew I not\nTo be both will and deed created free;\nYet that we never shall forget to love\nOur Maker, and obey him whose command\nSingle is yet so just, my constant thoughts\nAssured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest\nHath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,\nBut more desire to hear, if thou consent,\nThe full relation, which must needs be strange,\nWorthy of sacred silence to be heard;\nAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the sun\nHath finished half his journey, and scarce begins\nHis other half in the great zone of Heaven.\nThus Adam made request; and Raphael,\nAfter short pause assenting, thus began.\nHigh matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,\nSad task and hard:  For how shall I relate\nTo human sense the invisible exploits\nOf warring Spirits? how, without remorse,\nThe ruin of so many glorious once\nAnd perfect while they stood? how last unfold\nThe secrets of another world, perhaps\nNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy good\nThis is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach\nOf human sense, I shall delineate so,\nBy likening spiritual to corporal forms,\nAs may express them best; though what if Earth\nBe but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein\nEach to other like, more than on earth is thought?\nAs yet this world was not, and Chaos wild\nReigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests\nUpon her center poised; when on a day\n(For time, though in eternity, applied\nTo motion, measures all things durable\nBy present, past, and future,) on such day\nAs Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host\nOf Angels by imperial summons called,\nInnumerable before the Almighty's throne\nForthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared\nUnder their Hierarchs in orders bright:\nTen thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,\nStandards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear\nStream in the air, and for distinction serve\nOf hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;\nOr in their glittering tissues bear imblazed\nHoly memorials, acts of zeal and love\nRecorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs\nOf circuit inexpressible they stood,\nOrb within orb, the Father Infinite,\nBy whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,\nAmidst as from a flaming mount, whose top\nBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.\nHear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nHear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.\nThis day I have begot whom I declare\nMy only Son, and on this holy hill\nHim have anointed, whom ye now behold\nAt my right hand; your head I him appoint;\nAnd by myself have sworn, to him shall bow\nAll knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:\nUnder his great vice-gerent reign abide\nUnited, as one individual soul,\nFor ever happy:  Him who disobeys,\nMe disobeys, breaks union, and that day,\nCast out from God and blessed vision, falls\nInto utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place\nOrdained without redemption, without end.\nSo spake the Omnipotent, and with his words\nAll seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.\nThat day, as other solemn days, they spent\nIn song and dance about the sacred hill;\nMystical dance, which yonder starry sphere\nOf planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels\nResembles nearest, mazes intricate,\nEccentrick, intervolved, yet regular\nThen most, when most irregular they seem;\nAnd in their motions harmony divine\nSo smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear\nListens delighted.  Evening now approached,\n(For we have also our evening and our morn,\nWe ours for change delectable, not need;)\nForthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn\nDesirous; all in circles as they stood,\nTables are set, and on a sudden piled\nWith Angels food, and rubied nectar flows\nIn pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,\nFruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.\nOn flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,\nThey eat, they drink, and in communion sweet\nQuaff immortality and joy, secure\nOf surfeit, where full measure only bounds\nExcess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered\nWith copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.\nNow when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled\nFrom that high mount of God, whence light and shade\nSpring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed\nTo grateful twilight, (for night comes not there\nIn darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed\nAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;\nWide over all the plain, and wider far\nThan all this globous earth in plain outspread,\n(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,\nDispersed in bands and files, their camp extend\nBy living streams among the trees of life,\nPavilions numberless, and sudden reared,\nCelestial tabernacles, where they slept\nFanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,\nMelodious hymns about the sovran throne\nAlternate all night long: but not so waked\nSatan; so call him now, his former name\nIs heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,\nIf not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,\nIn favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught\nWith envy against the Son of God, that day\nHonoured by his great Father, and proclaimed\nMessiah King anointed, could not bear\nThrough pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.\nDeep malice thence conceiving and disdain,\nSoon as midnight brought on the dusky hour\nFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved\nWith all his legions to dislodge, and leave\nUnworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,\nContemptuous; and his next subordinate\nAwakening, thus to him in secret spake.\nSleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close\nThy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree\nOf yesterday, so late hath passed the lips\nOf Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts\nWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;\nBoth waking we were one; how then can now\nThy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed;\nNew laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise\nIn us who serve, new counsels to debate\nWhat doubtful may ensue:  More in this place\nTo utter is not safe.  Assemble thou\nOf all those myriads which we lead the chief;\nTell them, that by command, ere yet dim night\nHer shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,\nAnd all who under me their banners wave,\nHomeward, with flying march, where we possess\nThe quarters of the north; there to prepare\nFit entertainment to receive our King,\nThe great Messiah, and his new commands,\nWho speedily through all the hierarchies\nIntends to pass triumphant, and give laws.\nSo spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused\nBad influence into the unwary breast\nOf his associate:  He together calls,\nOr several one by one, the regent Powers,\nUnder him Regent; tells, as he was taught,\nThat the Most High commanding, now ere night,\nNow ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,\nThe great hierarchal standard was to move;\nTells the suggested cause, and casts between\nAmbiguous words and jealousies, to sound\nOr taint integrity:  But all obeyed\nThe wonted signal, and superiour voice\nOf their great Potentate; for great indeed\nHis name, and high was his degree in Heaven;\nHis countenance, as the morning-star that guides\nThe starry flock, allured them, and with lies\nDrew after him the third part of Heaven's host.\nMean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns\nAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,\nAnd from within the golden lamps that burn\nNightly before him, saw without their light\nRebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread\nAmong the sons of morn, what multitudes\nWere banded to oppose his high decree;\nAnd, smiling, to his only Son thus said.\nSon, thou in whom my glory I behold\nIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,\nNearly it now concerns us to be sure\nOf our Omnipotence, and with what arms\nWe mean to hold what anciently we claim\nOf deity or empire:  Such a foe\nIs rising, who intends to erect his throne\nEqual to ours, throughout the spacious north;\nNor so content, hath in his thought to try\nIn battle, what our power is, or our right.\nLet us advise, and to this hazard draw\nWith speed what force is left, and all employ\nIn our defence; lest unawares we lose\nThis our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.\nTo whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,\nLightning divine, ineffable, serene,\nMade answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes\nJustly hast in derision, and, secure,\nLaughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,\nMatter to me of glory, whom their hate\nIllustrates, when they see all regal power\nGiven me to quell their pride, and in event\nKnow whether I be dextrous to subdue\nThy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.\nSo spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,\nFar was advanced on winged speed; an host\nInnumerable as the stars of night,\nOr stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun\nImpearls on every leaf and every flower.\nRegions they passed, the mighty regencies\nOf Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,\nIn their triple degrees; regions to which\nAll thy dominion, Adam, is no more\nThan what this garden is to all the earth,\nAnd all the sea, from one entire globose\nStretched into longitude; which having passed,\nAt length into the limits of the north\nThey came; and Satan to his royal seat\nHigh on a hill, far blazing, as a mount\nRaised on a mount, with pyramids and towers\nFrom diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;\nThe palace of great Lucifer, (so call\nThat structure in the dialect of men\nInterpreted,) which not long after, he\nAffecting all equality with God,\nIn imitation of that mount whereon\nMessiah was declared in sight of Heaven,\nThe Mountain of the Congregation called;\nFor thither he assembled all his train,\nPretending so commanded to consult\nAbout the great reception of their King,\nThither to come, and with calumnious art\nOf counterfeited truth thus held their ears.\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;\nIf these magnifick titles yet remain\nNot merely titular, since by decree\nAnother now hath to himself engrossed\nAll power, and us eclipsed under the name\nOf King anointed, for whom all this haste\nOf midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,\nThis only to consult how we may best,\nWith what may be devised of honours new,\nReceive him coming to receive from us\nKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!\nToo much to one! but double how endured,\nTo one, and to his image now proclaimed?\nBut what if better counsels might erect\nOur minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?\nWill ye submit your necks, and choose to bend\nThe supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust\nTo know ye right, or if ye know yourselves\nNatives and sons of Heaven possessed before\nBy none; and if not equal all, yet free,\nEqually free; for orders and degrees\nJar not with liberty, but well consist.\nWho can in reason then, or right, assume\nMonarchy over such as live by right\nHis equals, if in power and splendour less,\nIn freedom equal? or can introduce\nLaw and edict on us, who without law\nErr not? much less for this to be our Lord,\nAnd look for adoration, to the abuse\nOf those imperial titles, which assert\nOur being ordained to govern, not to serve.\nThus far his bold discourse without controul\nHad audience; when among the Seraphim\nAbdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored\nThe Deity, and divine commands obeyed,\nStood up, and in a flame of zeal severe\nThe current of his fury thus opposed.\nO argument blasphemous, false, and proud!\nWords which no ear ever to hear in Heaven\nExpected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate,\nIn place thyself so high above thy peers.\nCanst thou with impious obloquy condemn\nThe just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,\nThat to his only Son, by right endued\nWith regal scepter, every soul in Heaven\nShall bend the knee, and in that honour due\nConfess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,\nFlatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,\nAnd equal over equals to let reign,\nOne over all with unsucceeded power.\nShalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute\nWith him the points of liberty, who made\nThee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven\nSuch as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?\nYet, by experience taught, we know how good,\nAnd of our good and of our dignity\nHow provident he is; how far from thought\nTo make us less, bent rather to exalt\nOur happy state, under one head more near\nUnited.  But to grant it thee unjust,\nThat equal over equals monarch reign:\nThyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,\nOr all angelick nature joined in one,\nEqual to him begotten Son? by whom,\nAs by his Word, the Mighty Father made\nAll things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven\nBy him created in their bright degrees,\nCrowned them with glory, and to their glory named\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,\nEssential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,\nBut more illustrious made; since he the head\nOne of our number thus reduced becomes;\nHis laws our laws; all honour to him done\nReturns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,\nAnd tempt not these; but hasten to appease\nThe incensed Father, and the incensed Son,\nWhile pardon may be found in time besought.\nSo spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal\nNone seconded, as out of season judged,\nOr singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced\nThe Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.\nThat we were formed then sayest thou? and the work\nOf secondary hands, by task transferred\nFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!\nDoctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw\nWhen this creation was? rememberest thou\nThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?\nWe know no time when we were not as now;\nKnow none before us, self-begot, self-raised\nBy our own quickening power, when fatal course\nHad circled his full orb, the birth mature\nOf this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.\nOur puissance is our own; our own right hand\nShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try\nWho is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold\nWhether by supplication we intend\nAddress, and to begirt the almighty throne\nBeseeching or besieging.  This report,\nThese tidings carry to the anointed King;\nAnd fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.\nHe said; and, as the sound of waters deep,\nHoarse murmur echoed to his words applause\nThrough the infinite host; nor less for that\nThe flaming Seraph fearless, though alone\nEncompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.\nO alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,\nForsaken of all good!  I see thy fall\nDetermined, and thy hapless crew involved\nIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spread\nBoth of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth\nNo more be troubled how to quit the yoke\nOf God's Messiah; those indulgent laws\nWill not be now vouchsafed; other decrees\nAgainst thee are gone forth without recall;\nThat golden scepter, which thou didst reject,\nIs now an iron rod to bruise and break\nThy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;\nYet not for thy advice or threats I fly\nThese wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath\nImpendent, raging into sudden flame,\nDistinguish not:  For soon expect to feel\nHis thunder on thy head, devouring fire.\nThen who created thee lamenting learn,\nWhen who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.\nSo spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found\nAmong the faithless, faithful only he;\nAmong innumerable false, unmoved,\nUnshaken, unseduced, unterrified,\nHis loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;\nNor number, nor example, with him wrought\nTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,\nThough single.  From amidst them forth he passed,\nLong way through hostile scorn, which he sustained\nSuperiour, nor of violence feared aught;\nAnd, with retorted scorn, his back he turned\nOn those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.",

In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat butter, oil, and both sugars until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla until it is combined. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Mix to combine. Gently stir in the peeled, shredded apples. Generously grease and flour a standard size bundt cake pan. Transfer the batter to the bundt pan and use a spatula to gently even out the top. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes before flipping the cake to remove the cake from the pan. Completely cool the cake on a wire rack. You can freeze the cake before icing by wrapping the cooled cake tightly in plastic wrap. For the maple glaze: Sift the icing sugar into a small bowl. This will prevent any lumps in your icing. Add the milk and maple extract. Mix well to combine. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.",

In a microwave-safe bowl, combine butter, milk and water. Heat for 2 minutes. Test with your finger; if the mixture is too hot to the touch, it will be too hot for your yeast. Add liquid ingredients to the dry mixture. Mix. Now add the eggs and mix well. Add 6 cups of flour. This will give you a very sticky dough. Add 2 1/2 cups of flour and knead in. Knead for 5 minutes. Your dough will be still be a little sticky. Add the oil to a bowl and roll your dough in it. Let rise for 2 hours, punch down and rise for another hour. For the filling: Divide your dough in half. Take one half and split it into 3 sections. You will need to roll this out in a long oval. Spread a little melted butter across the dough. You do not want too much or it will make your dough very soggy. Mix cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg together. Now sprinkle your mixture of sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg over the dough. (Don't use too much. This mixture will make two whole braids or 6 rolled out sections.) Once you have done this, roll up the dough. Now do this two more times. Once you have 3 pieces done, braid them together. Do the other half to the dough the same way. Tuck the ends under and let rise for 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for 28 to 30 minutes. This recipe makes two braids! For the glaze: Mix the melted butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla together. Take a spoon and drizzle over a cooled braid. Top with pecans and 3 cherries. Serve with coffee, milk or orange juice on Christmas morning. This is AMAZING!",
    "1 1/2 Tbl. grated ginger\n1 lemon\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 teaspoon yeast\ncool water\nclean 2-liter bottle or growler jug\n1. Juice the lemon and set it aside.  2. Pour the sugar into the bottle.  4. Pour the yeast into the bottle. Shake the bottle so that the yeast and sugar are mixed well.  5. Pour the ginger and the lemon juice into the bottle.  6. Fill the bottle about one-quarter full of cold water and shake well again, so that everything's mixed well and the sugar and yeast are dissolved.  7. Fill up the bottle with water until nearly but not quite full, leaving an inch or two of space from the lid.  8. Leave out the bottle in a warm spot for 2-3 days, or until it's carbonated to the degree you want. Then chill the ginger ale in the fridge and enjoy. (You'll probably want to filter the ginger ale as you pour it into the glass. Otherwise you'll get little bits of grated ginger stuck on your lips.)  Warning: If you leave the bottle too long in the warmth, you risk the bottle exploding.  Feel free to fiddle around with the amounts of ginger, lemon or sugar, as you like. Personally, I've found that 1 cup of sugar seems the perfect amount, for me, at least. Even a scant bit less makes the soda bland; a little bit more gets syrupy sweet.",
    "3 cups all-purpose flour\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n1 3/4 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n1 large egg\n6 tablespoons ice water\n1. Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and mix together with your fingertips or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. 2. Mix the egg with the water in a small bowl. Toss the mixture gently with the butter mixture until the dough comes together; do not overwork it. Divide the dough in half. Flatten each half with the palm of your hand to form a thick disk. Wrap both disks in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 3. Remove 1 disk of dough from the refrigerator. Unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of wax paper to form a circle about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky. 4. Use a spatula to help lift the dough and fold it loosely in half, then in quarters. Gently transfer the dough to the pie plate, placing the corner of the dough in the center of the plate. Open up the dough and press it lightly into the plate to fit. (If the dough should tear, just press it gently together.) Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. 5. Repeat the rolling process with the second disk of dough to make the top crust. The circle of the top crust should be 10 inches in diameter.",
    "1 chicken carcass or leftover bones from several legs, wings etc.\n1 stalk celery\n1 onion\n1 carrot\n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed (optional)\n3-4 cloves garlic, crushed (optional)\n1 bunch fresh thyme or 2-3 tsp dry\nPut everything in a big pot. Pour in enough water to cover the bones and veggies. Bring to a boil then turn to low heat. Skim off any foamy stuff that comes to the top of the broth. Simmer for about 3 hours (split up the time throughout the day if necessary - if you can watch the stove so long). Check periodically to stir up a little and add more water if it has evaporated too much (keep it at the level you started). After cooking, remove all the big pieces of chicken bones and vegetables with tongs or a spoon. There's no more flavor left in the vegetables or meat, so you can discard. The broth should look golden and delicious :) Let cool then strain out the broth to get rid of any small pieces of veggies, etc. and put in a big tupperware, or jar. If freezing, store in a freezer safe container or zip-lock bags after cooling. One easy way to use the fresh broth right away is to make a vegetable soup! Cut up your favorite veggies into small pieces (I used onion, celery, carrots, potatoes and cauliflower). Saute the veggies in a little olive oil, then pour in some broth to cover. Cook until vegetables are tender. This is also great to add noodles (and leftover chicken) too for chicken noodle soup!",

Add the salt and sugar and cook until dissolved. Add the fennel seeds, garlic, thyme and fennel fronds and remove from the heat. Let cool completely (or reduce the amount of water in the brine by 2 cups and add 4 cups ice cubes to cool down immediately). Transfer the brine to a plastic container, add the pork, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. For the smoked pork: Remove the pork from the brine, rinse well with cold water and pat dry. Put on a rack set over a baking sheet and refrigerate (to allow a crust, or skin, to form on the outside) for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours. Remove the grill grate and ceramic plate from the cooker. Add the hot hardwood charcoal and scatter the soaked wood chips over the top. Put on the ceramic plate and the grill rack, close the cover, bring the temperature to between 300 and 325 degrees F and allow to smoke for 10 minutes. Brush the entire loin with oil and sprinkle with pepper. Place on the rack, close the cover and smoke at 140 degrees F until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers, 1 to 1 hour 30 minutes. While the pork smokes, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey. Start brushing it on the pork about 30 minutes before it is done. When done, remove, loosely tent and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. For the fennel gremolata: Cut the fennel into small dice and coarsely chop the fronds; put in a bowl. Add the zest and juice and drizzle with a little olive oil; mix to combine. Let sit at room temperature.

Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy and begins to smell of yeast. Add the flour and butter to the yeast mixture. Attach the dough hook to the stand mixer and, on medium-low speed, combine the mixture until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and appears shiny, roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Spray a large bowl with non-stick spray (or lightly grease with vegetable oil) and place dough in greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Place bowl in a warm area and let dough rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Place an oven rack in the top third of your oven, and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Spray parchment paper with non-stick spray. Set aside. In a large pot, bring the 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil. Place the dough on a greased surface, and divide into 16 equal pieces (If you weigh dough, like I do, they will be about 2.20 oz. each). Roll each piece into a long rope, roughly 12 inches long. Carefully wrap half of each piece around a third of a hot dog. Pinch the ends together to seal the dough. If you run out of hot dogs before dough, make regular pretzels. Cut a little more dough off (3 oz.), and shape as desired. Place each shaped pretzel on the parchment lined baking sheet. Boil the shaped pretzels and pretzel dogs, one at a time, in the baking soda water for 30 seconds each. Using a slotted spatula or spider strainer, remove each pretzel dog from the water and place it on a drying rack to allow any extra baking soda mixture to drip off. Place the boiled pretzel dogs back on the parchment lined baking sheets. Brush with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with pretzel or kosher salt. Bake until golden brown, roughly 10 1/2 minutes (14 to 15 minutes for large pretzels). Transfer pretzel dogs to a cooling rack for a few minutes before serving. Serve with a variety of mustards or cheese sauce.",

    "2 poblano/pasilla peppers\n1 onion, chopped\n3 fresh corn, kernels cut off\n1/2 cup chicken/veggie broth or water\nsplash cream/whole milk\n1/4 pound queso fresco, cubed\nChar the peppers. Poblano pepper skins have a slightly bitter taste so you need to get it off. In order to do this you have 2 options. If you have a gas stove that produces a flame, char the peppers over the flame until the skin is black and blistered over the whole pepper. I have an electric stove so what I do is set the oven to broil and move one of the racks up to the very top. Broil the peppers, rotating as soon as the skin by the broiler is black, until it's charred on all sides. Put the charred peppers in a plastic bag or in a bowl covered in plastic as soon as they're done being charred to steam it so the skin peels off easily. Peel the peppers. Some peppers are a little spicy so wearing gloves could be useful. Peel all the skin off the peppers. Then remove the stem, seeds and veins. Slice into strips. Heat some olive or vegetable oil over medium heat in a pan big enough to hold all the corn and peppers. Saute the onion until clear and fragrant. Add the corn kernels, peppers and broth. Simmer covered for about 15 minutes. Add the splash of cream and remove from heat. Stir in cheese and enjoy.",

Add the sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, orange zest and cloves and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for about an hour. In the meantime, make the chocolate sauce. Combine the chocolate and cream in a small saucepan and set over low heat. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is just melted, and then remove from the heat and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the vanilla, cinnamon and cayenne pepper. If necessary, whisk in a little bit of water to loosen the sauce. Set aside in a warm place. Pour about an inch of oil into a wide, shallow saucepan and set over medium-high heat. When a small piece of batter sizzles after you drop it into the oil, you are ready to fry. Drop rounded teaspoons of the batter into the oil in small batches and fry for about 2 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown. Drain the fritters on paper towels, dust with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately with the chocolate sauce (if it has thickened too much, you may need to reheat the sauce gently, whisking constantly, and add a bit more water).",
    "2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter\n1 1/4 cups superfine sugar\n4 cups all-purpose flour\nBlanched almonds or pistachio nuts to decorate\nCream the butter and beat it until it becomes white. Add the sugar, beating constantly for about 5 minutes, until it is a smooth cream. Add flour gradually, working it in by hand. Although no liquid is added, this makes a very soft dough. If the dough is too soft, add a little more flour. Take walnut-sized lumps, roll them into balls, and flatten them slightly. Place them on a baking sheet a little apart from each other, as they spread slightly. Stick a blanched almond or pistachio on top of each one. Bake in a 325F oven for 2030 minutes. Do not let the ghorayebah overcook. They must remain very white: they taste quite different if they are even slightly brown. Let them cool before you try to move them. An exquisite variation is to replace 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup ground hazelnuts. You can flavor the dough with a grating of nutmeg, or 12 teaspoons of cinnamon or ground cardamom. Another traditional shape for ghorayebah is little bracelets. Roll the dough into 4-inch-long sausage shapes about 1/2 inch thick, and bring the ends together to make bracelets. Decorate with split almonds or pistachios.",

But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

Dust mites are something I’ve always suspected but was not officially diagnosed with it until I took the test. Growing up, I’ve always had cold urticaria but that seem to have disappeared only to be replaced with sun sensitivity. And there’s so little known about PMLE like I just wanna know what’s going on with my body. I feel so helpless. I just wanna be out and sunbathe and not to be so itchy the next day.",
    "Me and my wife moved to Alabama to take care of my grandparents, my grandfather has dementia and my grandma, Well she just has a bad habit of not doing stuff and just praying everything will work out. They moved to Alabama to our current house to live with my great uncle. He passed away without an updated will while verbally he said the house was going to my grandparents his will was made in the 1990s. We got the house probated and my grandpa ended up being the owner of the estate. My grandma told me that they had it put in their name and that they were going to make a will. After my grandpa passed away I found out that they neither put the house in their name nor did they make a will. Dose my grandma inherit the estate of my great uncle? Or are we going to have to probate the house again?",
    "Kind of following up on my earlier post. I've managed to get Mech Assault's .xiso extracted and onto my console's hdd via ftp networking but it won't boot. Am I missing something? When I try to rip it with dvd2xbox, it says it failed to get like 5 out of 90 files. I've tried ripping it twice with the same results. I don't want to keep trying to rip it or play it off the disc and contribute to burning out my disc drive. Not sure why the install isn't working. Anything obvious I'm missing? I was also wondering if anyone has actually played Mech Assault on a modded og xbox. Maybe there's just a compatibility issue with Evo x and the game. The game boots up and plays just fine if I do try to play it off the disc and it doesn't look damaged so I don't think it's a problem with the disc",
    "Missing 411 cases fascinate me in part because they really come closest to feeling like the closest real-life analogue to a Cthulhu-esque horror. In the Cthulhu books, these types of beings were portrayed as completely alien and unfathomable, like there is no way to understand their intentions or desires, they are just on another level entirely. They are also irresistibly powerful, mere humans have no hope of overpowering them or defeating them. In Missing 411 cases, we have no idea why this is done to people and what they get out of it, but there is a clear intelligence to which victims are taken, when they are taken, and how they are taken. Also, the entity responsible seems to have no constraints, taking people even from crowded areas and always being able to avoid being witnessed by other people or even security cameras. The implications of this phenomena are utterly terrifying and fascinating.",

    "Hi everyone, I’ve been selling for just over a year, launched 3 relatively successful products, and recently launched a fourth in the health and beauty category which has been a complete disappointment. I felt I had done my research, had invested in great photos and spent time making a keyword rich listing, but found the lower price point to be far lower than I expected to get even one or two sales. Long term I am struggling to see how I can make profit margins when I include PPC/VAT. Seems like there is now an ongoing price war in the niche and I can’t see anyone making money. I can always try to drive external traffic sources, improve the listing and drive more reviews, but when do you decide it’s not worth the investment with this ASIN and move on? A lot of gurus online talk about their biggest “failures”, but I had always felt there was a solution to most challenges that can be overcome by improvements to the listing or advertising approach before giving up. At what point do people pull out of a product line and decide this is a “failure” and not worth further investment?",
    "I’ve been talking to this girl for a while now and even though she tells me that she feels comfortable with me, it doesn’t feel like she is. She doesn’t send many pictures of herself even though I do and I also tell her she’s very pretty when she sends a picture or when she turns her camera on when we call. But she just doesn’t seem very comfortable with showing her face a lot. Also sometimes I feel like maybe I’m too clingy and I just want to be talking to her all the time and maybe that makes her uncomfortable. I’m also very open about how I feel about us and how I hope that in the future we can be together and even though she has told me that she wants to be with me too, sometimes it doesn’t feel like it. I don’t know maybe I’m just overthinking the whole thing and she does want to be with me but she’s just not as open about her feelings as I am.",
    "I'm slowly starting back up in the dating pool after a long term relationship and I think that probably the worst part about it is I relocated due to my job, and the city I'm in is considered one of the worst in the US for trying to find a relationship. So many reports of how the hookup culture hears vastly outweighs the dating culture. Definitely made me a bit worried, but maybe I'll get lucky. Also, aside from how bad dating apps have gotten from all of the extra features that help less and the addition of triple the pay walls for some apps, is it just me or has the landscape gotten more kinky? I mean, I look around and there are so many who mention that they have a kink. It definitely makes me a proven vanilla that much harder to find someone out there, and I'm already looking in a smaller pool of potential dates since I would love someone on the more nerdy/geeky side",
    "I think the title is self explanatory. It’s true. When I have a crush I hate myself for having a crush on them. Because I know that I can’t do anything about it. And although I would like to confess I’m actually scared of them saying yes. Weird right? I mean I’m supposed to happy if my crush says yes to goin g out with me but for me it’s the opposite. Because I know that when we’re together all I’m going to think about is when we break up. Where I’m going to break up with them. What the reason should be for me breaking up with them. And how I should break up with them. And that feeling makes me feel so guilty because this precious person is giving me their all and here I am being a half-assed person. But I can’t help myself from having a crush, it just happens. I feel sorry for whoever I come to like and come to date. I feel like I’m going to be lonely until the end of time.",
    "So I spent a day with my boy bestfriend and we went out and got food and spoke and we just had fun. Later when we were at his house he was being really comfortable and he cuddled me and was being different. I felt bad for liking it and wanting to take it further. It felt wrong to be like that with him so I broke up with my boyfriend. But that wasn't the only reason I broke up with him, I realized I didn't want to kiss him or anything anymore and I feel like I subconsciously moved him back to \"friend\" in my mind. And I'm 17 and realized I didn't really want such a serious relationship right now, or a relationship at all rn. So after that my boy bestfriend made a move and now he wants a relationship but I don't, but I liked it when he kissed me. So I don't know what to do",
    "I believe that the tech market will be down on Monday. The report was quite positive, smashing expectations for new jobs. There is other stuff. But I see value stocks back in play for Monday. Rotation out of tech for a day or two, and then back into tech for April. The fact that the report was positive sounds positive overall, but more jobs means more workers, and more people being out and about and spending on basic necessities that they needed. I can’t imagine this translating to more spending on tech stocks. I think there’s still value in some tech stocks, which is why I say April will be green overall, but I’m talking Monday open after Easter. Historically seems to be more favored to a down day also. Thoughts?",
    "My mom notably would always say she was gonna “drive away from the house” and leave, and stuff similar to that. My parents would always fight and actually get in legitimate fights with each other and I remember once when I was younger, they made me pick between which parent I wanted to stay with because I thought they were moving away from each other. I used to look back on this stuff and not think it was horrible, I don’t even know if I think it’s horrible now because I’m used to it. I remember once my dad would chase me with his belt around a table, I don’t know why he did this but he did, I must’ve done something to deserve it.. I remember being beaten/hit by both of them for reasons i don’t even know. i think being afraid of saying something wrong and having my stuff taken away from me as a consequence transferred over to me being this antisocial person that has trouble talking and being vulnerable with people.. anyway enough rambling, does that stuff cause abandonment issues/other things?",
    "For those freaking out about the price differences, think of it in comparison to the credit bureaus. Your credit scores are not the same across the board. Each bureau has a different way of calculating your score, and some have different information. But eventually, it all all even up and be closer to one another. If you are already getting restless and impatient, maybe you shouldn’t be investing in crypto or stocks for that matter. Everyone needs to take a chill, sit back and enjoy the ride. Buy the dips if you want to get more, but hold on to your coins and let the system do the work for you. If you are super worried about losing money, just pull out your initial investment once you make money, and let your profit do the work. But you’re gonna regret it when it takes off and you sold potential millions.",
    "Brief as backstory. My mother is emotionally damaged, severely, not her fault, but resulted in an upbringing where by the age of 9 I was taken to a lot of psychologists to find out “ what was wrong with me”. I left home when I was 14, stayed an aunt until I was 17, moved out and made my own life. Fast forward 13 years, I have a degree, job, house, kids everything I wanted, 2 weeks ago my mum was supposed to be attending a family event but decided not to go, but wanted to come and visit my kids and stay at our house. It’s been 1.5 years since we saw her last so I said yes. She came, was her typical self, this time I felt sorry for her as supposed to getting angry at her for her behaviours - she’ll tell my daughter they’ll go do something then say no she’s too tired. Anyway, since she’s left, I cannot shake the feeling of how I used to feel when I was 14. Things were never good enough, I wasn’t going to go far in life, my achievements aren’t really achievements. Then she texts and asks about only ONE of her grandchildren, typical her behaviour. I’ve talked to my husband about it, I’ve trained hard at the gym gone for extra runs. I’m short with my own kids which isn’t usual for me, I cannot fathom why she is doing the exact same thing she did to me and my brothers now she’s trying to divide my kids, she knew exactly what she was doing, she’s horrible - asked multiple times when my second child’s birthday was. I can’t seem to calm down from this, like I say, I’ve reverted right back to 14 and all those feels associated with that and it sucks.",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "This is like day 5 and i woke up this morning with like no withdrawal symptoms and no cravings. I basically just took supplements, drank a lot of water and coffee, and smoked weed at night. Honestly i think the supplements are what helped the most I strongly encourage who ever is quitting to take ashwagandha, Htp-5, and Rhodiola Rosea Extract two of each twice a day. Its been giving me the biggest boosts of serotonin and as i did feel the withdrawal symptoms this dramatically reduced them. I’m telling you if you are struggling take these and you will feel soo much better. And also smoke weed or take CBD if you like, it kinda takes the edge off. But i like these supplements so much I’ll probably take them for a long time",
    "I use syncthing on my Android phone and my PC to sync photos and ebooks etc. I thought it might be a good idea to tell my client to then only sync when I'm on my home network to save a bit of battery when I'm out and about and need it more. I don't really need it to sync to my PC while I'm out anyway, I can wait for it to do so automatically when i get home. I enabled location permissions and got it working, but was bummed to find that out requires location to be on to figure out what network I'm connected to. I never turn my location on at home because I don't need to use GPS to find my way around my house, 😆. Seems a really weird and silly way for this to work. Why can't it tell what SSID I'm on and figure without turning on my GPS. Are there any good workarounds besides leaving sync on all the time or turning location on when I'm at home?",
    "I have been taking klonopijn daily for around 5 years now. Recently since the pandemic started and my life started to fall apart before my eyes, I was upped in my dosage. Then I was upped again, and again, and again. Now I am at the point of taking 6mg-8mg/day. It has gotten completely out of control and made my situation from covid even worse and less manageable. and I almost have no tolerance. I want to start a taper, not an aggressive one, that will help bring me back down to at least 1mg/day. Could this be done in a couple of months? If so does anyone have good taper recommendations. Furthermore, considering the stress will feel at times almost unbearable, does anyone know of any good anti stress replacements or anything that can be taken during this process?",
    "Argus new changes in the advanced server is really bad. This is due to his base Physical Atk and growth being nerfed significantly. Furthermore we got a stun duration nerf for a range buff, but a range buff wasn’t needed yet that stun duration is crucial and the reason why i would even call it argus best skill.  all of this huge nerfs just for passive being 320% yet this depends on his physical atk so the nerfs actually nerfs this buff as well. So in conclusion. This changes overall nerfs argus. Current live argus is great tbh. a small buff instead to like 280% is suffice or just the quality of life like the animation stop i would say instead of basically nerfing him more in terms of dmg cause -75 is A LOT",

    "Every so often I have troubles getting an erection. I’m a 24yo male and shouldn’t have this issue. With my ex it was like a gust of wind could get it up. Now not so much. And as this happens every so often it affects my perspective of my feelings for her. It makes me question if I love her or not or if it’s my body telling me I am not attracted when I don’t actually feel that way. It’s depressing and I am on lexapro and know that can be a factor but am I crazy for thinking this . Is it just a snowball effect because of that? Is this a normal occurrence for people sometimes.

I've known what it's like to be in the darkest place in the world, and I really don't want to go back. Today, I had a lot of fun going out with a friend to watch Godzilla vs Kong and walk around town for a bit. At the end of the day, I came back home and just realized \"Man, everything is so damn awful when we aren't hanging out\". That led to a lot more thinking about how much I'm fucking up my life by failing tons of my classes, how much time I spend sitting here being a worthless person, and how I'm such a burden on everyone. Literally nothing seems fun unless I'm around them, and I think it's sad that, even though I have blood relatives, the only person I consider to be family is him. I guess I don't want to be loved, I want to feel loved. I really hope this is just an episode and not something worse. Sorry for the rant, but hey, I didn't make you read this.",

Couldn’t possibly imagine being prepared for a ton of people trying to play and having your server situation figured out beforehand so you don’t look as incompetent as every other crap gaming company in existence today.

    "Hey y’all, struggling Christian here with a question. When I pray alone I feel like I’m talking to myself. It feels weird because prayer is kind of like a letter to god so it shouldn’t feel like a conversation. But then I started think that all of the good feelings I get come from within me like happiness, joy, or excitement. Those are all internal feeing that can show through my expressions and words but at their core they are from my brain. And I used to think I needed to thank God for those feelings because he was the one that put them there. But now I feel like those good feelings I get are just a reaction based on what’s happening around me and to me. So my questions is: is it possible gods love comes from ourselves rather then from him? And if so why would I need God anymore?",

I also live with my fiancé and so when they interviewed me she asked all about him as well since we live in the same household. I figured we wouldn't receive any benefits because he made okay money then and was not laid off. At the time of the interview I did verbally tell my caseworker that he was not working at that moment only due to complications with covid shut down everything. She still had me send over his last 2 check stubs and then we ended up getting approved. I was shocked but excited. Cut to now.

One thing I’ve learned about is how much I dissociate and how this has been a defense mechanism since was a kid.  She has been gently letting me know that I may have some degree of DID or dissociative identity disorder.  This was pretty scary at first but I’m thinking that she may be on to something.  I don’t have multiple identities on the outside that anyone would notice, but it’s clear that my childhood trauma caused me to have splintered off parts of self that have never been integrated.  Those parts of self are in regular conflict with each other and the result is anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.

I think short sides and longer hair on top is so attractive and I want to look like that but I’m always worried I couldn’t pull it off.

Something along the lines of \"this type of trap has active and dynamic effects, and different aspects of it may have countermeasures\", kind of thing?  Or should I leave it to them to figure out.  I don't want to hand hold too much, but it also kind of sucks to be taking part in a 'mini-game' and not even know its happening.

I have also in recent years educated myself on basic programming so I also have an interest in how the stock market is run by computer. The program/s that run it is no doubt a monster. So, that leads me to a question. What is the likely hood that a stock can be 'throttled' so it doesn't rise as it should? The calculations tweaked so it is less responsive to growth. Assuming the rise of a stock is a linear rise, what if they set it so that it is a non-linear rise, finally topping out at a pre-specified amount? Who runs the software and servers that handle all of this? Is there a company that does it? The government? I've never heard anything on this subject, ever.",

My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

And on the internet I thought I had a chance to feel more comfortable, and act freely to be myself.

I try to be outgoing and social, but when people tell me Im being annoying it makes me feel stupid. And sometimes I tell myself, “be yourself”.

We broke up about 6 years ago. And while she moved on after couple of months Ive not been able to do the same thing even after 6 years. Not a day goes by when I don’t think about her. We haven’t talked since several years and i don’t want to disturb her life now. Every-time I initiate dating someone all i see is her face what would be her reaction on that joke or how would she react. She has a boyfriend now. While I’m still miserable. Trust me Ive tried moving on. Tried online dating. Tried everything. But she just cant go away from my mind. Her memories have become a painful comfort. Why do you think this is happening and what should I do to get over her? Ive tried therapy Ive tried burning mementos. But she is tattooed inside my mind.",
    "Covid is a contagious and deadly virus, no matter what people have read on their shady \"news\" sites or watched in YouTube videos. Actual experts and their advice exist. However, as a therapist, I am expected to validate thoughts and resulting ignorant actions as though it could be truth. I'm tired of it. Adults have a responsibility to educate themselves and recognize propaganda. In this case, the ignorance is killing people. Yet, I have to look them in the eye and pretend to understand their views so that I don't cause THEM more psychological harm as they breathe freely in my space without masks during a deadly pandemic. I don't love shaming people but if anyone should be, it is them. People I know have suffered. Some have died. But I can't, because somehow it is just expected that I'll put my health at risk daily, and not doing so could cost me my job, license, etc. I'm just over it, and over these ignorant folks.",
    "Hi. I want help if anyone can spare a few words of encouragement. I wrote religious on the topic of this because I am kind of a religious. I grew up catholic and I don’t follow the church a lot but I do have faith. I’ve posted her before about how my dad treats me. I’m the oldest daughter and I feel like my mom and I are used as the scapegoat to why everything is horrible for my dad. Anyway, I feel alone a lot. I pray and I feel like no one is listening. Does anyone have some scripture or words of encouragement from the Bible? I sometimes feel like I am the one in the wrong because my dad uses God and my faith against me. Anything would be great. I am going to get a keepsake with the Virgin Mary on it to keep me safe and to remind myself she is there with me. Anyway, thank you to this group. It makes me feel less alone.",
    "I’m a 23 y/o female, 5’2”, and currently weigh 141lbs. I work out 3-4 times a week and am on my feet constantly at work. I’d say I eat an overall healthy diet, cook majority of the time at home, and would describe  myself as moderately active. My concern is over the past year I have gained 10lbs and not changed any of these practices. I’ve been told the weight could be muscles or due to recently returning to school and undergoing stress but I find myself ashamed and unmotivated to continue working out and pushing myself harder. I love weights and cardio but have been finding it hard to motivate myself when I see the number on the scale going up. Am I just psyching myself out or do I need to revisit my overall health routine?",
    "My grandma passed away when I was 8 years old, over 25 years ago. She and my mom were very close; they talked almost every day and were like best friends. After she passed away it was like a light went out in my mom. Every occasion, happy or sad, has had a dark cloud over it because my grandma wasn't there. I miss my grandma too, but it makes me so sad to feel like I will never see my mom truly happy again. She is now the same age that my grandma was when she died, so all the grief is coming out even more. I am the main person she comes to for support and I don't know how to handle it. She calls me crying and says things like, \"I'm just so sad. My life would be so much better if she was still alive.\" I feel like I need to be the \"parent\" and support my mom because she is always so sad all the time.  I was wondering if anyone else was in a similar situation or had any words of advice or wisdom. Thank you.",
    "I had a dream when I was sitting on my couch at night with a girl I didn’t recognize. Although I didn’t recognize her she felt so familiar and it felt like I knew every thing about her. Her brother walked in through the front door and said something that frustrated her. I put my arm around her and then realized that I don’t know her, but she looked at me and put my hand back around her. We fell asleep like that and when I woke up she was gone. I went into my room and there were all these clues left around pointing to seemingly nothing. The only one I can remember is that there was an extra sticker near a power outlet that was a brand which I didn’t use. I recognized this bc I had always used a rival brand. All I can say is that the rest of the dream was me trying to find her and I never did. This last part was very vague.",

    "As a young person and recent defector of the Liberal/Democrat ideology, I have been thinking about the state of our culture and time here in America. Every day I feel myself compelled to stand up and speak in an act of revolution against the status quo. I feel as if God is telling me to follow my heart and speak the truth as an artist against the untruth. But fear is prevalent. Most art, film, music, writing are dominated by ideologically liberal leaning people. Websites where artists gather to advertise their work like YouTube and Facebook are censoring and banning voices that have Conservative values and ideas. How far can I get as an artist down this path? I feel like a bird being forced to crawl on the ground feeling so desperate and hopeless wanting to use the gift and passion my God has given me. In this time when the voice of a conservative is a revolutionary act, are there enough minds out there that would support or be interested in conservative art? I want myself to be economically stable enough to support myself, my future wife, and children. Or should I find another passion?",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

But it doesn’t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with “hitler was a nazi”. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with “that’s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.” What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every “nazi” so that it is only pure people with his beliefs.

    "So, I’m currently trying to teach myself astrology. I find that looking at each thing in my chart helps with understanding parts of it. Like for example, my Mars in Libra is what helps me approach things more calmly and my Mercury in Capricorn helps me to formulate my sentences before saying them. But what I have trouble with is putting everything together. I’ve been reading up on aspects and patterns as well, but I just get so confused. It’s like I have the puzzle pieces but I don’t know how to put them together. So I was wondering how everyone here got the hang of reading charts as a whole instead of just their parts?

Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",
    "With such an epic story, you would think someone like Stone would produce an epic film. From the random accents of the characters (specifically, I have no idea what Jolie was trying to do), to some pretty atrocious acting from Farrell-he's capable of much better, but this was at the height of his grandiosity and ego. There are so many moments where it feels like the film is onto something, only to have it stop and spin off into another, pointless direction. Bottom line: a $155 mil film about Alexander the Great should have been iconic, but Alexander falls flat on its face from the weight of the egos involved.",
    "The film is dark humoured, satiric and mocking mirror of society reflecting on human's obsession to fit in certain rules of society, despite how ridiculous they are. We step on our primary feelings and ignore our instincts just to play by the rules, to belong. And even it was the clear theme of being obsessed with being in a couple, I see it as a bigger reflection of society. After the main character runs into the woods, where he finds rebels of coupling, it's clear that they are as extreme as the hotel people. It looks like it's shown that people have to belong to survive, but options are limited and you have to obey, pretend or risk to be destroyed. Various examples of dysfunctional relationships are shown in the film, which looks so familiar – pretending to have something in common, pretending that you understand that you are the same. Desperation, rejection, cruelty in the relationships – we have seen and know it all, but director found the way to remind it with a lighter tone, with the possibility to laugh at ourselves and society. All the characters acted and talked in the same hyper-polite manner – that's what we do, so often we dance around difficult and extreme situations with our repressed feelings. And despite how similar everyone talked, with the same tone and politeness, we can see through that and find individuality of the characters, and it shows that we are more than just rules, etiquette  The obsession to have something in common with you partner reached the peek at the end. It looked like even David and blind women are still in love, but a realisation that in society norms they don't have anything real in common drives to an extreme decision. It shows that we sacrifice so much if we love someone different, and all just to be more acceptable in the society, but at the end society doesn't care, so do we just have to be braver? This film makes more think than feel. The audience who is used to relate to the characters might find it difficult, as even the main character is not very lovable, he is a week and very human in other words. It's not a 'feel good' film but not miserablism, it's smart and innovative reminder",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.<br/><br/>The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.<br/><br/>I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.<br/><br/>If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it. It's too late now - I can't get it out of my head. I don't think I've ever been affected this much by a movie.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.<br/><br/>It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.<br/><br/>It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.<br/><br/>Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended.",
    "Ice age 3 was really funny and it stays true to the series. Same old characters, a whole new adventure that everyone at any age can enjoy.<br/><br/>I saw the critics and I thought to my self that it would be good, but I didn't expect much, but I really did enjoy it more than I thought. It may not be the best compared to the other Ice Age films, but it still a great thrill ride that the audience can enjoy.<br/><br/>And if you find a theater near you that has it in digital 3D, go and watch it in 3D, because the action and adventure will excite you even more than it actually does.<br/><br/>Normally people think since it's a third part, then the movie won't be that great, but hear me when I say that keep that thought out of your mind and parents, take your kids with you, they are sure to leave with a smile and a long lasting excitement for more.<br/><br/>100% enjoyable, its a 10!",
    "I love this movie! It was so adorable, so charming & the writing was absolutely terrific! I love the animation & the characters (including the minions) were all fantastic! A MUST WATCH!",
    "Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. <br/><br/>The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! <br/><br/>For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go see this.",
    "I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.<br/><br/>Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. <br/><br/>The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room, my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. <br/><br/>The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!<br/><br/>Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. <br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. <br/><br/>Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. <br/><br/>John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. <br/><br/>I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as \"Sergeant Major Dickerson\",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",
    "We all remember being a teenager.  A crazy, intense time when your high were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant.<br/><br/>John Hughes movie brilliantly captures that environment, that era in our lives, and all the social rifts that we all helped to create for ourselves. I have heard it said that \"The Breakfast Club\" is melodramatic, overacted, and simplistic.  If you subscribe to that flippant perspective you might as well join Vernon in his office because you are doing the same thing that he did.  Seeing the movie as you want to see it, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.<br/><br/>If you really want to understand this film, think back to your own high school days.  Think about your last year there.  Dig out your old diary or book of angstful poems and reaquaint yourself with who you were then, when you felt things more deeply.  \"The Breakfast Club\" does not exist not for highschool kids, as some suggest.  Why would they need it?  They live there. It exists for all of us who have already been through there, who feel that they are above it now.  It exists so that we can remember what it was like and better understand ourselves, and the next generation.  Because you can't dismiss something you understand.",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot?

    "I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.",
    "As most are undoubtedly aware this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS (1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.<br/><br/>But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.<br/><br/>Shooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.<br/><br/>Later, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together. <br/><br/>But SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.",
    "I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.<br/><br/>As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!<br/><br/>Overall - 8/10",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",
    "This film was exceptional and one of the best I've seen this year. Watiti has great comedic vision and the cast is phenomenal. Jojo Rabbit was wierd , funny , heartwarming and heartbreaking and I think its definitely worth the watch.",
    "I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no \"Finding Nemo\" or \"Toy Story.\" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!<br/><br/>In my opinion, Cars 1 was a little slow. It dragged a little too long in certain parts. Cars 2 suffers from no such thing.<br/><br/>To sum it up; Cars 2 may not be Toy Story but it sure is FUN and ENTERTAINING.",
    "I am truly sadden that this film got bashed so much. I hear reviews saying this film \"sucks\" or it has too many inaccuracies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List have also \"some\" inaccuracies in them. (They are Masterpieces) It is pretty sad this film has been getting this bashed. It doesn't deserve to be.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is full of suspense and is directed beautifully by Kathryn Bigelow. I'd have to say this is movie truly captures the Iraq War. What a dangerous war it was for our soldiers. This movie shows us what our soldiers went through. This isn't bashing the American soldiers at all or even War. It gives us a great deal of appreciation for our troops who are risking their lives every single day for Us, Freedom and the U.S.A.<br/><br/>The true purpose of this movie is to not just praise the soldiers. But for one of the military's unrecognized heroes which are the technicians of the bombs squads who risk their lives to save others. This is the purpose of the movie to let everyone know what these people do.<br/><br/>This time and I know all of you out there, don't want to hear it, the critics are actually right. This movie is fantastically directed by Kathryn Bigelow and she rightfully deserved her Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>I know many Avatar fans out there probably rated this movie a 1, without even seeing it because it won Best Picture and Avatar didn't. This movie seems its suffering from the curse of Best Picture. More people have watched Avatar than the Hurt Locker. So of course this film has gotten bashed by so many. I think SOME of the bad reviews are the Avatar Fanboys who are just angry Avatar didn't win Best Picture.<br/><br/>Please don't just go along with the bad reviews this film has gotten from IMDb. Just try and watch this film.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a war epic, that I hope it becomes appreciative as time passes. 9/10 Highly recommended.",
    "It's funny, but I notice most of the prior comments are from guys, but speaking as a woman, this is by no means just a guy's flick. It's been one of my favorite films since the day it came out. It's got everything- drama, romance, action, and an honest to goodness story. There are even interesting themes, like the moral dilemma that Wyatt finds himself in-- Is he compelled to help fight the Cowboys even though he's \"retired\" and just wants to live out his life in peace? Is there a moral equivalence between killing for justice and killing for retribution? How far can a man go to sacrifice his own integrity and better judgment? Even though the Earps are the \"good guys\", the movie doesn't glamorize violence. Doc Holliday and some of the Earps' other sidekicks (\"Creek Johnson\" and \"Texas Jack\") are obviously pretty shady characters, but at the end of the day, are forced to choose between right and wrong, and they choose correctly. It doesn't get much better than Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't get nominated for it. I also appreciate the fact that the love story between Wyatt and Josephine didn't dominate the film and take away from the real plot, ala \"Titanic\". The love story simply served its purpose in helping viewers to better understand the character of Wyatt. Also the friendship between Wyatt and Doc was portrayed tenderly but not wussily. And okay, as a woman, let me just say that there is no one sexier than Sam Elliot. Man alive, if there ever was a person born to portray a cowboy, that guy is IT. If you've never seen a Western, or are not a fan, try this movie. It will make a believer out of you.",

    "SAW III in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series. For many reasons- one reason being that it keeps it simple. Instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in SAW's II, IV, and V, SAW III, like the original, has much fewer characters, leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone. And while it does have sub-plots, they don't feel out of place, they're not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences. They feel organic, they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to why.<br/><br/>If you've seen a SAW film, you know the story is going to have twists, turns, and violence/gore to accompany them. But at least SAW III does it very well. It expands on characterization and back stories for these characters and ties up the loose ends as believably as this franchise can do. We also get a deeper look at the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, knowing more about how the two really look at each other. Jigsaw is the calm, cancer-stricken anti-hero who does these evil things to prove a moral standpoint. Amanda, on the other hand, doesn't seem to grasp this - instead using the traps to torture her victims as a way to get back at innocent people for the way she was tortured herself with suicidal tendencies and drug abuse. With these two extremes, we see how much Jigsaw is trying to mentor her in his vision while she struggles with her own demons. And when Jigsaw gets ill, we see that Amanda really isn't a fitting apprentice to carry on his legacy as her vindictiveness comes out.<br/><br/>SAW III is also supported by the fact that the two protagonists are developed deeply. Maybe not as much as our two anti-heros, but we understand where they're coming from. From Lynn's dour nature to devastated Jeff's situation. The subplot with Jeff by the way adds some great underlying messages to the film. These messages shows us that hate, vengeance, revenge, and complacency brings more pain than anything else, and does not solve anything. It ruins families, destroys relationships, clouds judgment, and at the end: self-destruction. Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two films with James Waan and flew solo writing the screenplay for this one, does a nice job giving the spotlight to all the characters instead of just focusing on Jigsaw and Amanda. He makes SAW III more of a character study than any of the other installments and that's one of the essential reasons why this installment scores high.<br/><br/>Darren Lynn Bousman directs a much more subtle film than he did with SAW II and SAW IV. The quick edits are kept to a bare minimum (thank God) and the film has a lot of dread going for it. Very moody and darkly atmospheric. He focuses on the drama and emotion at hand, which was a vast improvement on SAW II and especially SAW IV. He lets the acting and the situations do the work for him instead of being extra-fancy with the camera work. Lastly, the cinematography is a plus. Darren shoots the film with a vibrant and kinetic feel and uses good, non-queasy camera movements. I love the lighting most of all though; he uses a wide arrange in the color palette (from lime green to icy blue). He definitely proves here that he knows how to grasp the material and visualize it. His direction of III ranks alongside James Waan's mindblowing direction of the original.<br/><br/>The acting is hardly an issue. It's usually good or better. Tobin Bell can play John Kramer in his sleep by now for gods sake! He shows excellent range and is always effective in the role because he gives the character more depth than what the script probably provides. Shawnee Smith is superb as Amanda, who will always be one of my favorite characters in the series. This is without a single doubt her shining moment, her most dramatic portion in the series. You really want to hate her but you just can't because you pity her. Smith could have easily played the character as an annoying nutjob, but she gives the character substance and unbelievable humanality. Angus Macfadyen as Jeff is superb in his role as well; he makes Jeff the most realistic and sympathetic character within the entire series. As far as I'm concerned, McFayden nailed the mourning father act. Bahar Soomekh was decent but always outshone by Bell, Smith, and McFayden. Her acting was a bit flimsy at times, but for the most part she gave a nice performance and made her character likable.<br/><br/>The suspense and tension, while not as impressive as the original, is still great. Hardly any other Saw film or horror film in general for that matter (with the exception of Eden Lake from last year and Inside from 2007) has been so edge-of-your-seat gripping, so exciting. The slow pacing allows you to gradually absorb everything in, and this makes it all the more better.<br/><br/>There is a lot of extreme gore in this film, but unlike some other installments like Saws IV and V, it's done very well and serves a purpose. Jeff's bloody trials are in a lot of ways cathartic. You're enduring these horrific scenes along with Jeff, and the relief at the end that the horror is over really fits with the theme of redemption through forgiveness. Moreover, the revelation that the horror isn't over, and what you feel as a result, drives home the Shakespearean tragedy in a very personal way because you the audience have to keep enduring it.<br/><br/>SAW III is clever, solidly written, has the best characters, succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for, and ties up loose ends perfectly. For a third installment in a horror series, it's incredibly strong.",
    "And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive \"Spider-Man\" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.",

Sure she could be scared (of being revealed to be a fraud by the true her) but not of a shadow. Again, purposeful misleading to set up the twist.<br/><br/>3. Why does the good version go insane and deciude the only way to get revenge on her evil self is to raise an army of evil duplicates that murder their good halves? Again, contrived and makes no sense.<br/><br/>4. Why didn't/ couldn't the good version of the girl use the escalators to escape the evil realm? This really doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>5. How the hell did all of the evil versions have enough food/ water to survive?<br/><br/>6. Surely not every single copy of everyone in the world was stored in the one bunker shown. So how did the \"Good\" girl convince all of the evil copies (of all the rest of the world) to arise??<br/><br/>There are probably many many MANY more issues with this film. But god does it destroy itself trying way too hard to set up a profound twist that is just completely illogical.",
    "Don't believe the negative reviews on this one. Its easily the most underrated movie I have come across, and can best be described as a hidden gem for the ones who like historical adventure/action-movies (Braveheart/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/Robin Hood) and fantasy-movies. <br/><br/>Others have described it better here on IMDb, so I am just going to say this: It is not a historical correct piece, and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy, even though the vikings portrayed and their buildings/settlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.<br/><br/>Btw: To all you who like the above-mentioned movies for the big battle-scenes and sword-fighting, don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area (even though it got them). On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in pre-medieval times. Instead of having the one super-hero defying all logic, you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie, with Banderas, Storhøi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.<br/><br/>This is a great adventure of a movie, which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.<br/><br/>9/10 - Must see for all who like adventure/fantasy",
    "Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.<br/><br/>The good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.<br/><br/>The actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.<br/><br/>The bad. Since it's so bizarre, it won't please everyone.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don't think you'll see your run of the mill kind of film and you'll have fun.",
    "I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on \"the list\" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like \"Superbad\", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of \"40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Superbad\", or \"Knocked Up\".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the \"TV actors on the big screen\" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of \"That 70s Show\" didn't follow her to \"Forgetting\"'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that \"Forgetting\" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than \"American Psycho 2\" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on \"CSI\") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious \"American Psycho 2\"); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with \"Superbad\"). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt \"Knocked Up\"). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write \"Fun with Dick and Jane\".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",
    "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:<br/><br/>First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?<br/><br/>Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.<br/><br/>During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",
    "I was talked into seeing this, and I have to shout it out, because it is a RIOT! I don't write many reviews, but when I love a film, I have to. If I have any complaint on this one, it's the title. I expected gross-out humor (\"crude\"). There isn't any, really. It's actually extremely unpredictable, subtle and extremely smart humor.<br/><br/>It has a story arc that you begin to somewhat anticipate, but you don't feel you're being patronized. Instead, you're left feeling that very intelligent people put this thing together in hopes that everyone would find something to love about it.<br/><br/>The cast is great, the animation is fun, and it's non-dizzying 3-D.<br/><br/>When I saw it, the entire audience clapped at the end, because we were entertained throughout, and found the ending really satisfying.<br/><br/>What else? Sweet emotions crop up because we can all relate to the family dynamics. Every family has the screw-up, the salt of the earth, the rebel, and the stubborn one. And it has one of the funniest babies ever put on film. A baby unlike any baby you'll ever see anywhere.<br/><br/>Very, very funny. Definitely recommend.",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! <br/><br/>10/10",
    "\"Atonement\" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class comedy of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and accidentally sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison. <br/><br/>In Act II, set in 1940, Robbie, released from jail, is now a soldier with the British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans, kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becoming estranged from her family as a result. In Act III we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.<br/><br/>After \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \"Becoming Jane\", James McEvoy is the rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the best yet that I have seen. Whereas Dr Garrigan in \"The Last King\" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in \"Becoming Jane\" hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in conveying his character's basic decency, achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and this is her second film with director Joe Wright after \"Pride and Prejudice\". Although she was good in the comedy \"Bend it like Beckham\", I think that her films with Wright are her best, suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" in which she seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film I have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and to Vanessa Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the epilogue, set in 1999. I felt, however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a good film, but \"Atonement\" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years, and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances. One of its themes in particular, the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps McEwan's final twist, although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, however, the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel, Wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination, something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels. \"Atonement\" joins that list of films (\"Far from Heaven\" and \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" are other examples that come to mind) where almost every scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of Act II, where Wright can find a terrible beauty even in war, especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the Dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light. Particularly moving was the scene where the British soldiers sing \"Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\". The second line of John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course, \"Forgive Our Foolish Ways\"- a particularly apt comment on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Also very good was Dario Marianelli's musical score, which (appropriately for a film in which writing plays an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and late summer (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it comes to next year's Oscars. 9/10",

    "Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised \" Esther's secret\" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the \"secret\" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a \"creepy\" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",
    "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.<br/><br/>At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.<br/><br/>There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",

    "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original \"Willy Wonka\" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",

    "Mass amateurization refers to the capabilities that new forms of media have given to non-professionals and the ways in which those non-professionals have applied those capabilities to solve problems (e.g. create and distribute content) that compete with the solutions offered by larger, professional institutions. Mass amateurization is most often associated with Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies include the rise of blogs and citizen journalism, photo and video-sharing services such as Flickr and YouTube, user-generated wikis like Wikipedia, and distributed accommodation services such as Airbnb. While the social web is not the only technology responsible for the rise of mass amateurization, Clay Shirky claims Web 2.0 has allowed amateurs to undertake increasingly complex tasks resulting in accomplishments that would seem daunting within the traditional institutional model. In addition to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed a variety of digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, trackbacks, and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during the first decade of the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.",

    "Bass–Serre theory is a part of the mathematical subject of group theory that deals with analyzing the algebraic structure of groups acting by automorphisms on simplicial trees. The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of free product with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass–Serre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory. History\nBass–Serre theory was developed by Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970s and formalized in Trees, Serre's 1977 monograph (developed in collaboration with Hyman Bass) on the subject. Serre's original motivation was to understand the structure of certain algebraic groups whose Bruhat–Tits buildings are trees. However, the theory quickly became a standard tool of geometric group theory and geometric topology, particularly the study of 3-manifolds. Subsequent work of Bass contributed substantially to the formalization and development of basic tools of the theory and currently the term \"Bass–Serre theory\" is widely used to describe the subject.",
    "Hemoglobin Barts, abbreviated Hb Barts, is an abnormal type of hemoglobin that consists of four gamma globins. It is moderately insoluble, and therefore accumulates in the red blood cells. Hb Barts has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, so it cannot release oxygen to the tissue. Therefore, this makes it an inefficient oxygen carrier. As an embryo develops, it begins to produce alpha-globins at weeks 5–6 of development. When both of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes which code for alpha globins becomes dysfunctional, the affected fetuses will have difficulty in synthesizing a functional hemoglobin. As a result, gamma chains will accumulate and form four gamma globins. These gamma globins bind to form hemoglobin Barts. It is produced in the disease alpha-thalassemia and in the most severe of cases, it is the only form of hemoglobin in circulation. In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis and normally die before or shortly after birth, unless intrauterine blood transfusion is performed. Since hemoglobin Barts is elevated in alpha thalassemia, it can be measured, providing a useful screening test for this disease in some populations.",

    "High Angle Control System (HACS) was a British anti-aircraft fire-control system employed by the Royal Navy from 1931 onwards and used widely during World War II. HACS calculated the necessary deflection required to place an explosive shell in the location of a target flying at a known height, bearing and speed. Early history\nThe HACS was first proposed in the 1920s and began to appear on Royal Navy (RN) ships in January 1930, when HACS I went to sea in . HACS I did not have any stabilization or power assist for director training. HACS III which appeared in 1935, had provision for stabilization, was hydraulically driven, featured much improved data transmission and it introduced the HACS III Table. The HACS III table (computer) had numerous improvements including raising maximum target speed to 350 knots, continuous automatic fuze prediction, improved geometry in the deflection Screen, and provisions for gyro inputs to provide stabilization of data received from the director. The HACS was a control system and was made possible by an effective data transmission network between an external gun director, a below decks fire control computer, and the ship's medium calibre anti-aircraft (AA) guns.",

Typically, the different types of asset-based loans include accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, equipment financing, or real estate financing Asset-based lending in this more specific sense is possible only in certain countries whose legal systems allow borrowers to pledge such assets to lenders as collateral for loans (through the creation of enforceable security interests). Usage\nAsset-based lending is usually done when the normal routes of raising funds is not possible, such as the capital markets (selling bonds to investors) and normal unsecured or mortgage secured bank. This is often because the company has exhausted other capital raising options or needs more immediate capital for project financing needs (such as inventory purchases, mergers, acquisitions, and debt purchasing). Asset-based loans are also usually accompanied by lower interest rates, as in the event of a default the lender can recoup its investment by seizing and liquidating the assets tied to the loan.",

The simplest, or most evasive, approach is RAM-scraping, accessing the system's memory and exporting the copied information via a remote access trojan (RAT) as this minimizes any software or hardware tampering, potentially leaving no footprints. POS attacks may also include the use of various bits of hardware: dongles, trojan card readers, (wireless) data transmitters and receivers. Being at the gateway of transactions, POS malware enables hackers to process and steal thousands, even millions, of transaction payment data, depending upon the target, the number of devices affected, and how long the attack goes undetected. This is done before or outside of the card information being (usually) encrypted and sent to the payment processor for authorization. List of POS RAM scraper malware variants",

    "Chakán (, ‘1) oregano of this land; 2) macaw tail feathers.’) is the name of one of the Mayan jurisdictions (kuchkabalob) that existed on the Yucatan Peninsula at the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the sixteenth century. Unlike other jurisdictions, Chakán did not seem to have a centralized government or control of a dominant Halach Uinik, as in the case of the provinces Ceh Pech or Ah Kin Chel. This is inferred from the fact that upon the Spaniards' arrival, Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo) was well received by some local leaders (batabob), but not others, such as Ah Kin Chuy, who organized resistance in the region's eastern towns to repel Spanish settlers. The most important city in the jurisdiction may have been Caucel, which controlled the region's salt trade since this material came from Chuburná and Sisal. Caucel's batab, named Ah Kin Euán, was so open to the Spanish from the outset of the conquest that he converted to Catholicism and changed his name to Francisco Euán, maintaining his position as batab for much longer.",

    "European exploration and settlement of Oceania began in the 16th century, starting with Portuguese settling the Moluccas and Spanish (Castilian) landings and shipwrecks in the Marianas Islands, east of the Philippines, followed by the Portuguese landing and settling  temporarily (due to the monsoons) in the Tanimbar or the Aru Islands and in some of the Caroline Islands and Papua New Guinea, and several Spanish landings in the Caroline Islands and New Guinea. Subsequent rivalry between European colonial powers, trade opportunities and Christian missions drove further European exploration and eventual settlement. After the 17th century Dutch landings in New Zealand and Australia, but not settling these lands, the British became the dominant colonial power in the region, establishing settler colonies in what would become Australia and New Zealand, both of which now have majority European-descended populations. States including New Caledonia (Caldoche), Hawaii, French Polynesia and Norfolk Island also have considerable European populations. Europeans remain a primary ethnic group in much of Oceania, both numerically and economically. European settlement and colonization"

    "Roy Hodgson has accepted full responsibility for England's disappointing Euro 2016 campaign despite criticism from players and fans, saying that as manager, he is the one who should shoulder the blame. The team was knocked out in the first round after losing to Iceland and drawing with Russia while only managing to score two goals in three matches. Despite strong performances by individual players such as Harry Kane and Dele Alli, many have criticized Roy Hodgson's tactics, stating that they were too defensive and failed to take advantage of the talent at his disposal. In an interview earlier today, however, coach Roy Hodgson refused to lay blame on any single player or tactic but instead took personal accountability for the poor showing. He stated, \"As manager I am responsible ultimately...I'm paid handsomely sometimes criticised strongly, so this will be another episode where people can judge whether it goes well enough.\" With speculation already mounting about potential replacements including Gareth Southgate and Sam Allardyce, we may yet see changes in leadership before England takes part in next year's World Cup qualifiers.",

    "President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on European Union (EU) imports into the US, escalating an already tumultuous trade dispute between Washington and Brussels. The proposed taxes could target goods worth up to $4bn (£3tn), including luxury products such as French cheese and German cars.\nResponding to President Trump's announcement, the EU vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs if the US goes ahead with the plan. This would mark a significant deepening of the transatlantic trade conflict, which has been brewing for months over issues ranging from aircraft subsidies to industrial standards.\nThe tensions have rattled financial markets and drawn criticism from business leaders across the Atlantic, who warn that higher tariffs will only harm both sides' economies without resolving any underlying disputes. However, Mr Trump has remained defiant, insisting that American companies have been unfairly treated by their foreign counterparts for years.\nDespite efforts to reach a negotiated settlement, talks appear to have broken down completely, leaving officials on both sides of the Atlantic scrambling to prevent a full-blown trade war. In response to mounting pressure, some lawmakers are calling for new measures to protect vulnerable industries and safeguard American jobs. As the standoff shows no signs of relenting, experts fear that the long-term consequences of this tit-for-tat exchange could be devastating for global economic growth and stability.",

    "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has rejected claims that he ignored warnings about the invasion of Iraq in 2003, saying all available intelligence was considered before deciding to go to war. In an interview with the London Times published on Saturday, Mr. Blair hit back at suggestions that he had overlooked the views of senior officials who advised against going to war. He said there were differing opinions within his government and that it was ultimately his decision to authorize military action based on what he believed was necessary for national security. The former premier also defended his decision to support US President George W. Bush's administration in its push for war, arguing that international cooperation was needed to tackle global threats such as weapons of mass destruction. However, Mr. Blair acknowledged mistakes were made in post-war reconstruction efforts in Iraq and expressed regret over the loss of life resulting from the conflict.",

    "Chile, known as the world's top copper producing country, has just experienced its best year ever in terms of copper output. According to recent reports, the South American nation produced 5.76 million metric tons of copper last year, surpassing the previous record set in 2011 by nearly 400,000 metric tons.\n\nThe increase in production can be attributed to higher ore grades and improved productivity at mines across the country. Additionally, increased demand from China, which is the world's largest consumer of copper, also contributed to the surge in output.\n\nDespite concerns over declining commodity prices, experts predict that Chile will continue to remain one of the leading producers of copper in the coming years due to its abundant reserves and advanced mining technology. The government has also taken steps to support the industry by implementing policies aimed at increasing investment and improving infrastructure in regions where mining activities are concentrated.\n\nOverall, the strong performance of the copper sector has had a positive impact on Chile's economy, with the metal accounting for about 20% of the country's export earnings. It remains to be seen how this year's output will compare, but it is clear that Chile's copper industry continues to be a driving force behind the nation's economic growth.",
    "The privatisation of Ukraine's largest steelmaker, Metinvest, has been declared illegal by the country's highest court. The Supreme Court's decision comes after a five-year legal battle between the Ukrainian government and the country's wealthiest man, oligarch Rinat Akhmetov.\n\nThe court ruled that the sale of a 50% stake in Metinvest to a Cyprus-based company, Pericles Emerging Market Partners Fund, was unconstitutional and violated the country's laws on privatisation. The ruling means that the sale cannot be recognised as valid and must be reversed.\n\nAkhmetov's SCM Holdings had challenged the sale, arguing that it was unfair and had resulted in the loss of billions of hryvnia (Ukrainian currency) in revenues for the state. The court agreed with this assessment, stating that the sale had been conducted in an irregular manner and without proper financial oversight.\n\nThe ruling is a significant blow to the government, which had hoped to attract foreign investment into the struggling steel industry. Metinvest, which produces around 20 million tonnes of steel annually, is one of Ukraine's largest employers and a key contributor to the country's economy.\n\nThe decision has also raised concerns about the impact on the wider steel industry, with analysts warning that the uncertainty surrounding the company's future could lead to job losses and further economic decline.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not yet commented on the ruling, but it is unclear what steps they will take to reverse the sale or how they will proceed with plans to privatise other state-owned enterprises.",
    "The latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that house prices in the UK have increased by 0.1% in the month of June. While this increase is marginal, it marks the second consecutive month of growth, offering a glimmer of hope for the struggling property market.\n\nThe rise in house prices has been attributed to a combination of factors, including the government's Help to Buy scheme and the ongoing shortage of properties on the market. However, experts have warned that the increase is not significant enough to signal a full-blown recovery in the property market.\n\nSamuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"The latest house price data suggest that the housing market remains stuck in a low gear, with price growth still very weak by historical standards.\"\n\nThe government has been working to address the issue of rising house prices, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak announcing plans to build 300,000 new homes per year in his budget earlier this year. However, it remains to be seen whether this initiative will be enough to tackle the underlying issues in the property market.\n\nOverall, the slight increase in house prices is welcome news for the property market, but it is unlikely to be enough to reverse the trend of declining confidence among buyers and sellers.",
    "Brazil's Congress has approved a landmark bankruptcy reform that aims to restructure the country's insolvent companies in a more efficient manner. The reform, which has been highly anticipated by investors and analysts, will allow companies to negotiate with creditors during bankruptcy proceedings, rather than facing automatic liquidation.\n\nThe reform, which has been in the works for several years, was approved by Brazil's lower house of Congress on Wednesday, with 247 votes in favor, 22 against and one abstention. It is expected to be signed into law by President Michel Temer in the coming days.\n\nThe new bankruptcy law is expected to be a major boost for Brazil's economy, which has been hit hard by a series of scandals and a deep recession. Many companies have been struggling to pay their debts, and the old bankruptcy system had been widely criticized for being slow and inefficient.\n\nThe new law is expected to streamline the bankruptcy process, allowing companies to restructure their debts more quickly and efficiently. It is also expected to attract more foreign investment to Brazil, as investors will be more confident in the country's ability to handle financial crises.\n\nHowever, some critics have voiced concerns that the new law could lead to a rise in defaults and further destabilize the already struggling economy. Others have argued that the law does not go far enough in addressing the root causes of Brazil's financial woes, such as high taxes and regulatory barriers to entry.\n\nDespite these concerns, the approval of the bankruptcy reform is being hailed as a major victory for Brazil's economy and a sign of hope for the country's future.",

The officials declined to give a precise figure for the costs, but acknowledged that the security bill for the royal family had risen in recent years.\n\nThe committee also probed the monarch's private income, which includes rentals from the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster, and commercial income from Sandringham Estate.\n\nIn response, Sir Michael said that the profits generated by the Duchies are used to support the Prince of Wales's charitable activities and to fund his official duties. He added that the monarchy has a \"moral obligation\" to be self-sufficient, but admitted that the royal family currently receives 1.5 million pounds a year in subsidy from taxpayers.\n\nCommittee Chairman, Nicky Morgan, expressed her concern over the lack of information available to the public and called on the royal family to be more transparent about their finances. She said: \"It is not good enough for an institution that receives significant public funding to be so opaque about its finances.\"\n\nThe questioning of the royal aides came after Buckingham Palace refused to provide details of the costs of securing the royal family, sparking criticism from MPs. In response, Sir Michael said that the royal family has a responsibility to protect the public, but acknowledged that the public has a right to know how their money is being spent.\n\nThe committee has invited Prince Charles and Prince William to appear before it in the coming months to provide further information on the royal finances.",

    "The debate on euthanasia laws in the UK is set to continue in Parliament today, as MPs gather to discuss the controversial topic. The issue has been a topic of much discussion in recent years, with calls for changes to the law from various groups, including those with terminal illnesses and campaigners for assisted dying.\n\nOpponents of euthanasia argue that it could lead to vulnerable people being pressured into ending their lives, and that it could undermine the value of human life. However, proponents of change argue that people should have the right to choose how they die, and that the current laws are outdated and do not reflect modern attitudes towards end-of-life care.\n\nThe debate is expected to cover a range of issues, including the legal and ethical implications of changing the law, the experiences of other countries that have legalised assisted dying, and the views of medical professionals and religious organisations. It is unclear at this stage what the outcome of the debate will be, but it is hoped that it will contribute to a wider discussion on the issue and help to inform any future changes to the law.",
    "British Home Secretary John Howard has responded to criticism over his government's handling of immigration and asylum seekers, saying that Britain is doing everything it can to tackle the issue.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Mr. Howard defended the government's record on border control, stating that the number of illegal immigrants entering the country had decreased significantly since he took office in 2002. He also emphasized the importance of providing refuge for genuine refugees while preventing abuse of the system by fraudsters and economic migrants.\nHowever, human rights groups have criticized the government's policies, arguing that they are too harsh on asylum seekers and fail to provide adequate support for those who are granted refugee status. Mr. Howard rejected these claims, insisting that the UK provides some of the most generous support in the world for refugees and that his government was committed to finding a balance between compassion and security.\nOverall, Mr. Howard stressed the need for a comprehensive approach to migration management, including stronger borders, effective enforcement, and engagement with countries of origin to address the root causes of displacement. While acknowledging that there were still challenges to be addressed, he remained confident that the UK was making progress in tackling the complex issues surrounding immigration and asylum.",
    "MPs have heavily criticised new housing proposals put forward by the government, stating that they are inadequate and fail to address the country's growing homelessness crisis. The proposed measures were met with outrage during a parliamentary debate on Wednesday, as members of parliament expressed concern over the lack of affordable homes and support for vulnerable individuals. \n\nAccording to critics, the proposals do little to tackle the root causes of Britain's housing crisis and instead prioritise large-scale development projects that benefit property developers at the expense of ordinary citizens. One MP pointed out that many families are struggling to make ends meet in expensive rental markets, while others are forced to live in temporary accommodation or on the streets. \n\nThe opposition party has called for urgent action to be taken to address the housing shortage, including investing in social housing and providing greater support for first-time buyers. However, the government has remained firm in its commitment to reducing regulation and increasing homebuilding rates, arguing that this will ultimately lead to more affordable housing options for people across the country. \n\nDespite the criticism from MPs, the government remains determined to push ahead with its current strategy, citing recent increases in home building activity as evidence of progress. However, opponents argue that these figures mask the underlying issues facing those who cannot access decent, affordable housing, and call for a reevaluation of the government's approach.",

    "The European football governing body, Uefa, has approved the use of artificial turf for all competitions, including the Champions League and Europa League. The decision was made after extensive testing and research into the safety and performance of the surfaces.\n\nUefa had previously banned artificial turf for its top club competitions, but changed its stance after manufacturers improved the quality of the surfaces. The new artificial turf is designed to mimic the characteristics of natural grass, providing a more realistic playing experience for players.\n\nThe decision has been welcomed by clubs and players, who have long called for the use of artificial turf in winter months when natural grass pitches can be unsuitable. However, some environmental groups have raised concerns about the impact of artificial turf on the environment and the health of players.\n\nUefa has assured that it will continue to monitor the use of artificial turf and work with manufacturers to improve the surfaces further.

    "TOKYO - Japan's industrial output unexpectedly declined in September, indicating that the country's fragile economic recovery might be losing steam.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the seasonally adjusted industrial production fell 1.4% from the previous month, surpassing economists' expectations of a 0.4% rise.\n\nThe decline was primarily driven by a sharp contraction in production at auto assembly plants, which tumbled by 13.5%. Furthermore, production of electronics also dropped by 2.6%, pointing to weakening demand for consumer goods.\n\nAdditionally, the production of capital goods, such as machinery and steel, decreased by 2.9%, indicating that business investment remains sluggish.\n\nHowever, the METI data showed that the output of energy products increased by 7.3%, owing to the impact of the devastating typhoons that hit Japan in September.\n\nThe news of declining industrial output highlights the challenges faced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he tries to reinvigorate the country's economy with his ambitious Abenomics policies.\n\nMoreover, the Bank of Japan's highly accommodative monetary policy has not yet translated into robust growth, prompting some economists to question its effectiveness.\n\nThe recent developments in Japan's industrial output further underscore the need for concerted efforts to boost domestic demand and stimulate business investment to sustain the economic recovery.",
    "Gibraltar, the small British Overseas Territory located at the southern tip of Spain, has been the subject of ongoing talks between UK and Spanish officials regarding its future. The discussions come amid growing tensions over Brexit and Spain's claim to the territory. \n\nAccording to sources close to the negotiations, representatives from both countries have met in recent weeks to discuss potential solutions to the long-standing dispute. Topics reportedly covered during the talks included increased cooperation between Gibraltar and Spain, as well as possible changes to the territorial status quo.\n\nWhile no concrete agreements have yet been reached, both sides are said to be committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the impasse. A spokesperson for the UK government emphasized that London remains firmly committed to protecting the rights and interests of Gibraltarians, while Madrid has stated that it is open to dialogue and willing to explore new avenues for resolving the issue peacefully.\n\nThe latest round of talks comes after years of strained relations between Britain and Spain over Gibraltar.

    "The controversial hunt ban, which was introduced in 2005 to regulate hunting with dogs, has seen its public support dwindle over recent years, according to new research.\nA survey conducted by YouGov found that while 51% of respondents supported the ban in 2006, this figure had dropped to 36% in 2019. The study also revealed that younger generations are less likely to back the measure compared to older age groups.\nCritics of the ban argue that it unfairly targets traditional country pursuits and puts rural communities at risk of losing their way of life. However, supporters claim that it helps protect wildlife and prevent unnecessary suffering for animals.\nEnvironmental campaigners have called on the government to review the effectiveness of the ban and consider alternative measures to tackle animal welfare concerns. A spokesperson for one group said: \"It's clear that attitudes towards hunting with dogs have shifted significantly since the ban was first implemented, and we need to ensure that our laws keep pace with changing opinions.\"",

    "Scientists have developed a new technique that uses lasers to help bridge gaps in rural broadband networks. The technology, known as \"point-to-point\" (PtP) laser communication, works by transmitting data via a laser beam between two points, allowing for faster and more reliable internet connections in remote areas.\n\nAccording to a recent study, more than half of the UK population still does not have access to superfast broadband, with many rural areas being left behind. This is partly due to the high costs involved in laying cables and installing infrastructure in remote locations.\n\nHowever, the new PtP laser communication system could provide a solution to this problem. Using sophisticated optics and high-powered lasers, the system can transmit data over long distances without the need for physical cables or satellites.\n\nThe technology has already been successfully tested in several countries, including the US and Japan, where it has been used to provide high-speed internet connections to remote islands and mountainous regions.\n\nIn the UK, several companies are already working on implementing the technology, with one provider claiming that it can provide speeds of up to 10 Gbps - over 150 times faster than the current average UK broadband speed.\n\nWhile the technology is still in its early stages, it is hoped that it could revolutionize the way that rural areas are connected to the internet, helping to bridge the digital divide and provide faster and more reliable broadband connections for everyone.",

    "The automotive industry is set to revolutionize its approach to designing cars with the introduction of robotic pods that will handle most aspects of vehicle creation, from sketching initial designs to testing prototypes. This new technology has been in development for several years and is now being implemented by major automakers around the world.\n\nAccording to experts, these advanced robots are capable of analyzing vast amounts of data related to consumer preferences, market trends, and engineering requirements. They can then use this information to generate multiple concept sketches within minutes, allowing designers to quickly explore different ideas without having to spend hours manually creating each one.\n\nFurthermore, once a final sketch is selected, the same robotics system takes over the task of generating detailed 3D models which engineers can manipulate easily before moving onto physical prototype production using rapid manufacturing techniques like additive layer deposition or laser cutting.\n\nThis streamlined process promises significant cost savings while also ensuring greater accuracy throughout every stage of automobile manufacture - something that could ultimately lead to safer vehicles equipped with more innovative features than ever before.\n\nWhile some critics argue that replacing human workers with machines may result in job losses across various industries including auto design, proponents point out that such advancements often create entirely new positions requiring specialized skills previously unavailable due to technological limitations.\n\nOverall, it seems clear that automated pod systems represent an exciting step forward for both innovation and efficiency within the global motor trade, transforming how we conceive, develop & produce automobiles well into the future.",
    "In an effort to improve disaster recovery efforts, charities and NGOs are turning to text messaging as a means of communication with affected communities. The use of mobile phones has become ubiquitous in modern society, making it an effective way to reach people quickly and efficiently during crisis situations.\n\nDuring natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes, traditional forms of communication like landlines and cell towers can be disrupted, leaving emergency responders without vital information about the needs of affected populations. Text messaging, however, is much more resilient and can often continue working even when other methods fail.\n\nCharitable organizations have recognized this advantage and are now using SMS texts to provide critical updates on evacuation routes, shelter locations, and food distribution points. In addition, they may also send out surveys asking individuals about their specific needs so that aid can be targeted effectively. This type of two-way communication allows for a greater degree of coordination between relief workers and those impacted by disaster.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, texting offers a highly scalable solution to managing large volumes of data generated during emergencies. With millions of messages being sent at once, humanitarian groups can gain valuable insights into patterns of behavior among displaced persons - everything from migration trends to healthcare access requirements. Such real-time feedback loops enable better decisionmaking overall, which ultimately saves lives.\n\nOverall, the increasing reliance on technology amid catastrophe underscores how innovation is helping us adapt to emergent challenges facing humanity today. From advanced satellite imaging to cuttingedge analytics platforms capable of crunching vast amounts data within seconds flat, we stand evermore equipped tackle calamities both new ones yet unknown still lurking around corner..",

    "Valorant esports has been growing rapidly since its release, with an increasing number of teams and players participating in competitive play. However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed in order to improve the overall quality of the scene. One major concern is the lack of consistent, high-level competition outside of the professional scene. While there are plenty of amateur and regional tournaments available, there is a lack of opportunities for up-and-coming teams and players to compete against top-tier talent. This makes it difficult for new players to break into the scene and for lower-tier professional teams to find high-level competition to practice against. Additionally, there is a need for more consistent and transparent ranking systems, as well as better resources for teams and players to access in order to improve their skills and knowledge of the game. Overall, while Valorant esports is in a good place right now, there is still room for improvement, and addressing these issues will be key to ensuring the long-term success and growth of the scene.",

    "On April 1st, Netflix announced a new feature called \"Netflix's unintentional April Fool's tax\". The feature was supposed to be a joke, but it turned out to be anything but. Instead of the usual streaming experience, users were greeted with a message that said \"Due to recent tax laws, we are now required to charge a 'Netflix tax' on all of our services.\" The tax was said to be a whopping 20% of the total cost of the subscription.\n\nMany users were outraged by the announcement, with some even calling for a boycott of the service. Others saw it as a clever marketing ploy, but were still upset at the idea of having to pay more for their streaming services.\n\nDespite the backlash, Netflix refused to back down, insisting that the \"tax\" was real and that they had no choice but to implement it.

    "Liver cytology is the examination and analysis of liver cells, or hepatocytes, obtained through fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. This procedure involves using a thin, hollow needle to remove a small sample of tissue from the liver, which can then be examined under a microscope for signs of disease or other abnormalities. Liver cytology plays an important role in diagnosing various liver conditions, including cirrhosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\nThe process of performing a liver cytology FNA biopsy typically begins with the patient lying on their left side with the right arm extended overhead. The skin over the right upper abdomen is cleaned with antiseptic solution, and local anesthesia may be administered to reduce discomfort during the procedure. A small incision is made in the skin, and the doctor inserts the needle into the liver until it reaches the desired depth. Once the sample has been collected, the needle is removed, and the wound is covered with a bandage.\n\nAfter the biopsy, the specimen is sent to a laboratory where it is prepared for microscopic evaluation. The hepatocytes are spread onto glass slides and stained with special dyes that highlight specific cellular structures. A pathologist then examines the slides under a microscope, looking for any abnormal features such as enlarged nuclei, increased chromatin density, or bile duct invasion. These findings can help diagnose different types of liver diseases and determine appropriate treatment options.\n\nIn some cases, liver cytology may also involve the use of specialized staining techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, to further evaluate the samples for certain proteins or markers associated with particular liver disorders. Additionally, molecular testing methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can sometimes be employed to detect viral DNA or genetic mutations linked to liver cancer.\n\nOverall, liver cytology serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying and monitoring various hepatic conditions. By providing insight into the health and function of liver cells, this technique helps guide clinicians in selecting appropriate treatments and managing patients' care effectively.",

    "\"Pass the Peace\" is a phrase commonly used in Quaker meetings for worship, which are the central religious gatherings of the Religious Society of Friends. The phrase is typically passed around the circle of worshipers as a symbol of the peace and unity that is felt during the meeting.\n\nIn Quaker worship, there are no ordained ministers or pre-determined sermons. Instead, worship is led by a clerk, who calls the meeting to order and records the minutes. The meeting begins with a period of silent worship, during which worshipers sit in silence and wait for the \"leading of the Spirit\". This may result in one or more individuals rising to speak, or to share a message or insight that has come to them during the silence.\n\nAfter the period of silent worship, the clerk will pass a basket around the circle for the collection of offerings. This is followed by the passing of the peace, during which worshipers rise and pass the phrase \"Pass the Peace\" to their neighbors. The phrase is often accompanied by a handshake or a nod of the head, and serves as a physical symbol of the spiritual peace and unity that is felt during the meeting.\n\nThe passing of the peace is not limited to Quaker worship, however. It has been adopted by some other Christian denominations, as well as by secular groups seeking to promote peace and unity.

    "William Sarnoff Paley (1901-1990) was an American businessman known for his influential role in the development of broadcast television as both an industry pioneer and longtime chairman of the Board of Directors of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS).

    "Renée Vivien (1877-1909) was a French poet and writer who is best known for her collection of poems, \"La Chanson des Gueux\". Born in Paris to working-class parents, Vivien grew up in poverty and struggled to make a living as a writer.

    "Anti-discrimination law refers to a set of laws that aim to prohibit discrimination based on various legally protected grounds such as race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and disability. These laws are designed to promote equality and protection against unjust treatment in various settings such as workplaces, schools, and public accommodations.\n\nThe concept of anti-discrimination law has its roots in human rights and equality principles, which hold that all individuals should be treated fairly and with dignity, regardless of their identity or background. Anti-discrimination laws seek to achieve this goal by outlawing certain behaviors, such as denying someone a job or promoting certain policies that result in unequal treatment of certain groups.\n\nOne of the key features of anti-discrimination law is that it often requires employers, educational institutions, and service providers to take proactive steps to prevent discrimination from occurring. For example, an employer may be required to provide training to their staff about the dangers of unconscious bias and the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Similarly, schools may be required to implement policies that ensure students are treated equally and that all students have equal access to educational opportunities.\n\nIn addition to promoting equality and dignity, anti-discrimination laws also serve to protect individuals from harm and harm caused by discrimination. For example, these laws may provide protections for individuals who have been subjected to harassment or violence based on their identity or background.\n\nOne of the most significant anti-discrimination laws in many countries is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which is responsible for enforcing laws related to employment discrimination. Other countries may have similar legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act in the United States or the Equality Act in the United Kingdom.\n\nOverall, anti-discrimination law plays a crucial role in promoting equality, protecting individuals from harm, and ensuring that everyone is treated with dignity and respect.",
    "Enamelin is a protein that is secreted by ameloblasts, which are cells found in the enamel organ of developing teeth. It is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan and plays a crucial role in the mineralization process of tooth enamel. Enamelin is responsible for providing the structural framework for the mineral crystals that make up tooth enamel, and it helps to regulate the rate of mineralization.\n\nEnamelin is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus of ameloblasts and is then secreted into the extracellular matrix. It forms a complex with amelogenin, another protein secreted by ameloblasts, which helps to initiate the process of mineralization. The mineralization process involves the precipitation of hydroxyapatite crystals, which are the primary mineral component of tooth enamel. Enamelin helps to organize these crystals into a highly ordered, tightly packed structure that is resistant to wear and acid erosion.\n\nEnamelin is essential for the proper formation of tooth enamel, and mutations in the gene encoding enamelin can lead to dental enamel defects and tooth decay. These defects can include hypoplasia, hypomineralization, and amelogenesis imperfecta, which are all characterized by weak and porous enamel that is more susceptible to decay.\n\nEnamelin is also found in other tissues, such as bone and cartilage, where it plays a role in the mineralization of these tissues. In addition, enamelin has been found to be a potential biomarker for certain diseases, such as osteoporosis and periodontitis.\n\nOverall, enamelin is a critical protein for the formation and maintenance of tooth enamel, and its function is essential for the development of a healthy dental structure.",

The coalfield includes several major seams of coal, including the Midland, Bargarran, Baragwanath, and Blackband formations. \n\nCoal mining has been carried out in Fife since at least the 15th century, with many pits opening during the Industrial Revolution. Some of the largest and most productive mines were located near Cowdenbeath, Cardenden, Lochgelly, Glencraig, and Longannet. At their peak, these mines employed thousands of workers and produced millions of tons of coal per year. However, declining demand for coal and economic factors led to the closure of many mines throughout the 20th century, with the last deep mine closing in 2002.\n\nDespite the decline of the industry, the legacy of coal mining remains prominent in Fife's culture and economy. Many former miners and their families continue to live in the region, and there are numerous memorials and museums dedicated to the history of coal mining in Fife. Additionally, efforts have been made to reclaim and regenerate abandoned mine workings and other industrial sites, such as through habitat restoration projects and the creation of recreational spaces.",

    "Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are a type of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. These bacteria are resistant to carbapenems, a class of antibiotics that are used as a last resort for treating severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. CRE infections are difficult to treat and can result in prolonged hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and increased mortality rates.\n\nCRE are primarily found in the genus Enterobacteriaceae, which includes common bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These bacteria can acquire resistance to carbapenems through various mechanisms, including the production of enzymes that inactivate the antibiotics, reduced permeability of the bacterial cell wall, and altered target sites of the antibiotics.\n\nCRE infections can occur in a variety of settings, including hospitals, long-term care facilities, and community settings. Patients with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or diabetes, are particularly vulnerable to CRE infections. In addition, CRE can spread easily between patients in healthcare settings, leading to outbreaks of infection.\n\nPrevention and control of CRE infections require a multifaceted approach that includes infection control measures, surveillance of CRE infections, and the judicious use of antibiotics. Infection control measures include hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, and isolation of patients with CRE infections. Surveillance of CRE infections can help identify outbreaks and track the spread of resistance. Antibiotic stewardship programs can help prevent the development of resistance by ensuring that antibiotics are only used when necessary and prescribed at the appropriate dose and duration.\n\nIn cases where CRE infections cannot be prevented or treated with antibiotics, alternative treatments such as phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, and immunotherapies are being explored. However, more research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these treatments.\n\nIn conclusion, CRE are a growing public health concern due to their resistance to carbapenems, a last-resort antibiotic, and their ability to cause severe infections in vulnerable populations. Prevention and control of CRE infections require a multifaceted approach that includes infection control measures, surveillance, and antibiotic stewardship programs.",
