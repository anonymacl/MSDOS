    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",
    "  The $A_\\infty$ T-system, also called the octahedron recurrence, is a\ndynamical recurrence relation. It can be realized as mutation in a\ncoefficient-free cluster algebra (Kedem 2008, Di Francesco and Kedem 2009). We\ndefine T-systems with principal coefficients from cluster algebra aspect, and\ngive combinatorial solutions with respect to any valid initial condition in\nterms of partition functions of perfect matchings, non-intersecting paths and\nnetworks. This also provides a solution to other systems with various choices\nof coefficients on T-systems including Speyer's octahedron recurrence (Speyer\n2007), generalized lambda-determinants (Di Francesco 2013) and (higher)\npentagram maps (Schwartz 1992, Ovsienko et al. 2010, Glick 2011, Gekhtman et\nal. 2014).\n",
    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). COB is computationally\nefficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for multi-scale\ncontour detection and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for\nhierarchical segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the\nstate-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and\ndatasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness\nof our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical\nimage segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile,\na fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical\nSegmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, demonstrating the robustness and value\nof our framework, even when fully supervised training is feasible.",
    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges. We show that the QANet accurately estimates the scores of\nthe evaluated segmentations with respect to the hidden ground truth, as\npublished by the challenges' organizers.\n  The code is available at: TBD.",
    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

    "Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over.

It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.\nKevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing.

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast.

    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",

But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan.

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\nAndrew Cole (Australia).",
    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes. For every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programme's run, 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal.",
    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

    "Film-maker Spike Lee says black representation is stronger than ever in cinema and TV but the true power in entertainment lies behind the camera.\nThe She Hate Me director urged students at his old Atlanta university, Morehouse College, to seek \"gatekeeper positions\" behind the scenes. Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

    "Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years.\nFounding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed. \"We're actually into it as we speak. We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we're doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "I'm seriously really upset at second boss vault of stars. For a pure melee rogue it's next to impossible to help with the ice. Since we're pretty squishy as it is if you're standing on ice for more then. 5 seconds you're dead. That's insane but I can dodge and shit so whatever. But the aoe the boss does for ice just randomly hits after putting a red circle around u. Like it's really hard to dodge as I haven't found its timed at all.. Again I can get past that. What I can't get past is the god damn icicles. It's literally impossible as a melee character to help get your team broken out. The ice surrounding it hits insanely hard which is fucked. So I can't be near it. If I so happen to hit one good encounter and break them out it explodes and kills me. So which leaves me with one option tunnel vision. Which does the job  UT only once every 60 seconds. Ice happens every 20 so wtf am I to do. Help if there is a way",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "As the title says, I got this extreme feeling of wanting to drink women's milk from her tits. I don't know if there is a link for that, but I always want to do it. Even if she's not pregnant. I want to like keeping sucking till some comes out. Maybe, when I have a wife, I'll be sucking on her tits while she's pregnant with our own baby😂. But, right now, I want to just suck on some female's tit for some milk. Maybe, it's because I wasn't able to do it as a child since I was allergic to a lot of things as a baby, so I couldn't. But, now, I'm fine. I don't care if the woman's tits are small or big. I just want to suck them for the milk🤤😂😂. Like a milk vampire🤣. I'll probably get off just by sucking them dry🤤",
    "Not exactly sure where to post this but I thought this was a good one. I recently moved in with my good friend from high school after graduating college in May. Things are good between us, I have known him since middle school and we get along great. The rough thing is I am and have always been jealous of him. He's a tall attractive blonde guy with natural good looks and I am let's say not that. I have come to terms with not being super attractive a long time ago but it is tough to hear him talk about all the girls he rejects or gets with. He just seems happier than I am with his life, I work IT and make a sizeable salary while he works part time with no degree and takes a nap for most of the day. He just seems better than me at all of our shared hobbies. I don't want these feelings to ruin our friendship because he is a good friend but I find myself getting more annoyed at it after moving in. Any advice?",
    "I finally got around to giving my retriever a bath today after a month. He's been itchy these past few days and I figured a bath would help him. He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",

Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ?

    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",

While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer.

    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible.

I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",

All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you.

I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit.

    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

    "Now I know Victreebel can get swords dance and everything good mainly in postgame of fire red making the only real moveset I want to go with for him is razor leaf, body slam, toxic or acid, and maybe double team or rest. Victreebel isn’t the best in the older gens or maybe he is I have no idea. But I’d love to know what you think maybe I can give him other moves I’m deciding on either him or exeggutor and I really don’t know what else to use the rest of my team is gonna be Charizard, Primeape, Lapras, Raichu, and Nidoking and Victreebel is getting the 6th spot if I can find him viable, this is for ingame only also and I have access to get a bellsprout cause my brother has leaf green, I’d love to hear what you guys think and thanks.",
    "my best friend would always comment on my moms ass, tits, etc. he would always say how he fucks her yk the usual shit. until i came home early from playing basketball and i see my best friends car in the driveway. i go inside and it’s quiet but my moms home bc of covid. i go into her room to ask why he’s here to see my childhood best friend fucking my mom. she hurried for her clothes and that’s when i saw his dick. it had to have been at least 9 inches while i’m only 3 inches. while my moms rushing for clothes he tells her to stop and that he wants to see what’s in my pants. my mom didn’t say anything and neither did i do he came over and choked me against the wall and dropped my pants. he made my own mom take a picture or our dicks next to each other and then told me he wants to keep fuckign my mom. obviously i said no and we were going back and forth until he just holds me down and ties me up with bedsheets. he forced me to watch him fuck my own mom. she loves every part of it and was so surprised to see how much bigger his dick was",
    "I just watched fragment of trash taste how they lambasted Kazuya for that thing with not running after Mizuhara and i m wondering... I know when i started reading i felt he was pain in the ass but kinda understand where all those things he did come from and just gave him some pass. His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave. Is it really that bad in anime or am i just incel feeling bad for other incel ? I felt really down in my life for quite some time so i relate to characters with low self esteem especially this low like Kazuya, because it's uplifting when he tries to fight for himself out there.",
    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time. Advice on how to handle this situation?",
    "Started a new job, its kinda scary not physically knowing who your teammates are. I mean chat chat pero iba pa din like 1st day at sabay-sabay kayo kakain, tatawa kayo pag lahat kayo nahihirapan, etc. It kinda feels like on your own dba. Parang zoom meetings feel awkward din, saglint lng and like its kinda different din like having the vibe of someone working beside you and making chikka. Its awkward just inviting people na \"hey magzoom tayo para lng may presensya\" and it doesnt feel the same. Anyone who can give advice on how to handle this scenario? I guess its the feeling of uneasiness din sa new role, new company and before pandemic, hadn't realize the value of having people starting with you.",
    "Their motivation is pretty weak to be honest and Marvel's attempt to connect their motivation with \"The Blip\" makes absolutely zero sense either.  Like what motivated them to do what they do in the show? We got a glimpse of it like wanting the life before the blip to come back and \"blip refugees\". Why are the blip refugees struggling exactly? Why the life after the blip sucks even more? I'm not saying that every single question have to be answered ,but the way they try to make the audience sympathize with the Flagsmashers just doesn't work. Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",

Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself.

I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers. It has to be something about my hair causing this, I just can’t for the life of me figure out why or how. Does anyone have any ideas at all? Has anyone else experienced this?",
    "In my opinion Charmx isn’t leaving. The fact that it still shows that he still has 2.4K videos is pretty fishy, they could all possibly be unlisted or maybe deleted which could suck for him. My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

    "Whilst playing in the Great War mod I was loosing a war of attrition. The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia. I was pleased to have so much land after such a long war. However, my happiness was short lived as I was slapped in the face by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",
    "Our relationship is already stressed, and she is going through that phase everyone goes through where if someone dares correct her or politely inform her that she is making a mistake she blows up. I’ve done everything I can, and managed to find a ten gallon. It used to be in a five gallon, and a ten gallon was all I could find for her considering I’m broke from my own gosh and she wasn’t putting any effort into it. She comes to me with her fish problems but doesn’t listen to my advice when she hasn’t asked for it in regards to her fish’ safety. She told me a couple minutes ago that his stomach was looking a little big, he hasnt been swimming around much any more, and he isn’t eating as much/ at all. Tomorrow morning I convinced her to put him into a smaller container for a bit so I can get a good look at him and take a picture. Any suggestions?",
    "I’m still struggling in some aspects of the therapy. I’ve got the Amara View mask, which is comfortable enough. No problems falling asleep. Not snoring, which is great. AHI is generally between 4 and 8 while I can keep it on. But if the thing, Philips Dreamstation, goes 12 or over, i cannot breath out and end up almost choking on my own air. Doesn’t happen regularly. Maybe 2x in the last 2 weeks. I get a good, solid 3 hours after I initially fall asleep. After that, i’m usually up like at least 2 or 3 times and, recently, take the thing off after i hit about 4.5-5 hours just to get some sort of sleep. I don’t THINK i’m having claustrophobia issues. I’ve never had issues with claustrophobia in any other situations. I’m struggling to function during the day more now than before i started on the CPAP. I don’t know. I’m venting more than anything.",
    "Those of you in condo's and detached homes in Victoria, That have mini split heat pumps. How loud is your compressor unit outdoor? We had a two head unit mini split installed in August and it is loud as heck. The installer came out multiple times. Of course every time they came the unit wouldn't make the noise. It happens more at night and when it's really cold. I know they make noise but I feel like the amount of noise this unit makes is substantially louder than it should be. A friend of ours had one put in by the same installer. And his is whisper quite. I'm at my wits end on what to do. The installer keeps saying it's normal noise. But when the tv volume had to be turned up to drown out the noise of the outdoor unit. I feel like that's excessive.",
    "It gives me extreme anxiety when people come toward me for a hug or high-five. This is because everyone seems to do hugs or high-fives differently. In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something. Anytime someone high-fives me, they look at me as if I am retarded when I try for a normal high-five because I don’t know what sort of weird-ass high-five they will try for. Sorry this is so long.",
    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing. If I can’t get it fixed, the guy said he’ll take it back and give me my money back but damn I really want this damn thing to start. I hate that I can’t drive it or do anything with it",

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",
    "Signed up for Fraser’s HWPO app and was looking forward to it but it’s been a complete disappointment so far. Didn’t get a password email like the first email today said I would. Figured out I could do a password reset and get into the app. Got into the app and didn’t have the program in there. Checked back a bit later and it had shown up so got my hopes up that issues were over. Not so much. App is SUPER slow, nothing will load and all I can get to is a list of “Day 1, Day2, etc” if I click them it just spins and loads. Has been a complete let down so far. I’ve used various fitness apps before and all of them have been pretty decent and seem to be built on a pre-canned template app that whatever celeb throws their name on and was expecting similar for this one but not so much. This is like a freshman programming class tried to do a school project and failed at it hard. Anyone else get different results?",
    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.

There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo?

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

    "GB is what go me into my love for hot sauce. I have bought a lot of it over the years. Recently I've noticed some small changes. The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money. I'd honestly pay more for it if it meant keeping the OG recipes. Maybe Dexter is getting tired of running the company? Maybe he is going to sell it?

    "I regularly lose all kinds of attraction for everyone,meaning no sexual or romantic attraction to anyone,meaning no desire to date anyone and looking at content and people that usually would make me feel feel sexually attracted stops doing just that.Those phases usually last between 2 or 4 months and I'm always worried that that my attraction will never come back when I have those phrases,however up until now it always has.Im pretty sure it's not sexual dysfunction becuase that doesnt include loss of romantic attraction and it doesn't affect me in any physical way,its all psychological.Im also sure that I'm not asexual since I do feel all that attraction outside of those phases.I have tried researching my symptoms but I've never really found anything that would match,and it's just really worrying me and I dont even know if its abnormal or  just a normal part of puberty.I also marked it NSFW just to be sure.",
    "So I’ve noticed that viewer ship is all over the place depending on when I post or what I post. I just recently had posts get around 5000-54000 views. I posted again earlier in the morning and only got about 14 views. I’m wondering if when I posts effects my views as much as even the content I’m posting. I’ve also noticed people don’t really want to know about my life they would rather watch me do impulsive things that they more or less want to do but can’t go through with like dying my hair or making things that the audiences hobbies coincide with. The steps of getting viewer ship seems very difficult but also all over the place. Some people use hashtags some don’t but still get 1000’s of views. What constitutes as the perfect time, the perfect description with hashtags or even the best content for your demographic? I’ve definitely improved my viewership since the vine era but it’s all really an equation of when and what. At some point I’m really hoping to find what it is my followers or new viewers exactly want to see but until then I am still figuring it out. Has anyone noticed what seems the best time to post or even the best hashtags to use? What content seems to do better for newer users to help boost their platforms? Maybe some people could take a look at my platform and critique what I post so I can improve. tiktok: ",
    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.  I’m curious, why do your MILs words/judgements bring you down?",
    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize.

Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life.

    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11.<br/><br/>4. All UAS aircraft are armed.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film.

A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in.

I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm looking for some advice on a sticky situation. My friend Mike and his wife Natalie have been married for about six months now, but things haven't exactly been going well. They were both really young when they got hitched, and they've realized that they're not as compatible as they thought they were. They've been fighting a lot lately, and they're starting to think that maybe they made a mistake by getting married in the first place.\n\nMy question is, can they get an annulment? I know it's not the same as a divorce, but I'm not sure what the differences are or if it's even possible for them to go this route. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! TIA!",

    "I've been dreading this day for weeks now. After two years of being emotionally drained and manipulated by my ex-boyfriend, I finally found the courage to break free from his grasp and cut off all contact with him. It hasn't been easy, but I've been focusing on healing and rebuilding myself.\n\nBut today, I have to see him again. We have a mutual friend who is throwing a party, and he's invited me. At first, I didn't want to go, but my friends convinced me that it would be good for me to face him and show him that I'm moving on. They said it would be a chance for me to closure and move forward.\n\nI'm still not sure if they're right, but here I am, getting ready to head out the door and face the music. My heart is racing, my palms are sweating, and my mind is filled with anxiety. What if he tries to talk to me? What if he tries to manipulate me again? What if I break down in front of everyone?\n\nI keep telling myself that I'm strong enough to handle this, that I've come too far to let him get to me again. But the truth is, I'm scared. I don't know what will happen when I see him, and the uncertainty is killing me.\n\nAll I can do is take deep breaths and hope for the best. Maybe this will be the start of something new, maybe it will be the end of something old. Either way, I'll make it through this. I have to.",
    "Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task in healthcare, which involves identifying and isolating specific structures or features within medical images. Deep learning techniques have revolutionized the field of medical image segmentation by enabling accurate and efficient segmentation. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of labeled data to achieve high performance. In real-world scenarios, obtaining annotated medical data can be challenging due to factors such as cost, time, and expertise required for manual annotation.\n\nTo address this challenge, recent research has focused on developing deep network models that can perform well with limited supervision. These models are designed to learn from small quantities of labeled data, leveraging various techniques such as transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning. This review provides an overview of recent advances in deep network models for medical image segmentation under limited supervision. We discuss different approaches, including fully convolutional networks (FCNs), U-Net, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and their variants tailored for segmentation tasks with limited annotations. Additionally, we highlight open challenges and future directions in this emerging area, including the need for better evaluation metrics, strategies for selecting informative samples for labeling, and exploration of new architectures and regularization techniques.\n\nThis review offers insights into the current state-of-the-art methods for medical image segmentation with limited supervision, providing researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of existing solutions and opportunities for further investigation. The discussed techniques have far-reaching implications beyond medical imaging, applicable to other domains where labeled data is scarce or difficult to obtain.",

    "Ugh, I'm so sick of high school. It's like, I get it, we're supposed to be learning and preparing for our future or whatever, but honestly, it feels like a never-ending cycle of stress and boredom.\n\nI mean, don't even get me started on the homework. It's like, I understand that we need to practice and all, but seriously, how much is too much? I swear, some teachers think we have nothing better to do than sit at home and do busywork all night long. And don't even get me started on the tests. Like, what's the point of testing us on stuff we learned months ago? Can't they see that we've moved on and are trying to learn new things?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the social scene. It's like, everyone's always drama-ing out about something, and it's hard to keep up. One minute someone's your friend, the next they're ignoring you because you accidentally sat in their seat in class. And forget about trying to make new friends - it's like, impossible. Everyone already has their cliques and they don't want anyone new joining in.\n\nI know I'm not alone in feeling this way. My friends are all stressed out too, and we're constantly venting to each other about how much we hate high school. But honestly, what can we do? We're stuck here until we graduate, and it feels like an eternity away.\n\nAnyway, rant over. Sorry if this was a bit all over the place, but I needed to get it off my chest. Does anyone else feel the same way? Or am I just being a dramatic teenager? Let me know in the comments!",

    "Sure! Here's my attempt at writing a review of the movie Deadpool:\n\nI just watched Deadpool and I am still trying to process what I just saw. I have mixed feelings about this film, but overall I think it was a fun ride. The action scenes were intense and well-choreographed, and Ryan Reynolds' performance as Wade Wilson/Deadpool was spot on. I loved how he was able to break the fourth wall and address the audience directly - it added a level of humor and self-awareness that made the movie feel fresh and different from other superhero films.\n\nThe supporting cast was also great, with standout performances from Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle and Ed Skrein as Ajax. The chemistry between Reynolds and Baccarin was palpable, and their romance added a nice touch of humanity to the film. The CGI effects were also impressive, particularly in the final showdown between Deadpool and Ajax.\n\nHowever, there were some parts of the movie that didn't quite work for me. The pacing was a bit uneven, with some scenes feeling rushed or dragging on too long. There were also a few jokes that fell flat, which was disappointing given the high comedy bar set by the trailers. Additionally, I felt like the film's tone was all over the place - sometimes it was goofy and lighthearted, while other times it was dark and violent. It was hard to get a sense of what kind of movie I was watching, which took away from my overall enjoyment.\n\nDespite these issues, I would still recommend Deadpool to fans of the character and the genre. It's a unique take on the traditional superhero origin story, and Reynolds' performance is definitely worth seeing. Just be prepared for a wild ride with plenty of twists and turns!",
    "England rugby coach Eddie Jones has confirmed that Joe Wilkinson will miss the upcoming match against Ireland due to an injury sustained during training.\n\nAccording to Jones, Wilkinson suffered a grade two hamstring strain while participating in a practice session earlier this week and will be out of action for at least three weeks. This means he will not only miss the crucial Six Nations clash with Ireland but also likely sit out the following game against France.\n\n\"Joe is naturally very disappointed,\" said Jones. \"He's been working hard and was in great form, so it's a setback for him and for us as a team.\"\n\nThe loss of Wilkinson is a significant blow to England's hopes of success in the Six Nations championship. The 27-year-old has been one of their standout players in recent years, known for his powerful runs and strong defensive skills. He played a key role in England's run to the World Cup final last year and had started all four of their matches in this season's Six Nations campaign.\n\nJones now faces a difficult decision in selecting a replacement for Wilkinson. One option could be to move Billy Vunipola to number eight and bring in Nathan Hughes or Alex Dombrandt at blindside flanker. Alternatively, he may choose to start Sam Simmonds at number eight and keep Vunipola at blindside. Whoever gets the nod will have big shoes to fill, as Wilkinson's absence leaves a significant void in the English pack.\n\nDespite the setback, Jones remains confident in his side's ability to overcome the Irish challenge without Wilkinson. \"We have a deep squad and plenty of talented players who can step up and make their mark,\" he insisted. \"We'll work hard in training this week and come up with a plan to take on Ireland.\"\n\nEngland face Ireland at Twickenham Stadium on Sunday, March 1st, kicking off at 3 pm GMT.",
    "Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish has dismissed speculation that captain Steven Gerrard could leave the club, insisting that he is going nowhere.\n\nGerrard, who has been at Anfield for 14 years, has been linked with a move away from Liverpool in recent weeks, with clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester City reportedly interested in his services.\n\nHowever, speaking to the media ahead of tomorrow's match against Fulham, Dalglish was adamant that Gerrard would remain a Liverpool player.\n\n\"Steven Gerrard is not for sale,\" Dalglish said. \"He's our captain, our leader, and one of the best players in the world. We don't want to lose him, and we won't be letting him go anywhere.\"\n\nDalglish also praised Gerrard's commitment to the club, saying: \"Steven has always shown a great desire to play for Liverpool, and I have no doubt that he will continue to do so for many years to come.\"\n\nThe news will come as a relief to Liverpool fans, who have grown increasingly concerned about the possibility of losing their talismanic skipper. Gerrard has scored 15 goals in all competitions this season, and his form has been instrumental in Liverpool's push for a top-four finish.\n\nDespite Dalglish's assurances, however, rumours of Gerrard's departure are unlikely to disappear completely. The player himself has refused to rule out a move away from Anfield, saying recently that he would consider any offers that came his way.\n\nFor now, though, it seems that Gerrard will remain a Liverpool player, much to the delight of the club's fans.",
    "Hey fellow fans! I've been following AJR for years and have noticed a trend that I think needs to be addressed. It seems like there's a growing divide between the band and their fanbase, with some fans expressing increasingly negative sentiments towards the group.\n\nI understand that everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I can't help but feel that some of the hate being directed at AJR is unwarranted and unfair. It's one thing to criticize their music or performances, but it's another thing entirely when people start making personal attacks or assumptions about the band members themselves.\n\nOne thing that really bothers me is when fans accuse AJR of being \"sellouts\" or \"trying too hard\" simply because they're trying to make a living doing what they love. Newsflash: making music is a business, and artists need to make money to survive. It's not fair to expect them to work for free or compromise their artistic vision just to appease a select few fans who think they know better.\n\nAnother issue I see is fans complaining about the band's sound changing over time. Let's be real – artists evolve and experiment with different styles all the time. It's called growth and progression. If you don't like every single song they release, that's okay! But don't act like they're betraying you personally by exploring new sounds and ideas.\n\nLastly, I want to address the constant criticism of the band's lyrics. Yes, some of their songs may not be as deep or meaningful as others, but that doesn't mean they're inherently bad. People connect with different types of music in different ways, and AJR's catchy pop tunes are no exception. Don't dismiss an entire album just because it doesn't fit your narrow definition of what constitutes \"good music\".\n\nIn conclusion, let's all try to be more supportive and understanding of our favorite artists. They're human beings who pour their hearts and souls into creating music for us to enjoy. If we can't appreciate their efforts and",
    "This paper proposes a novel approach to polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image semantic segmentation, which combines the 3D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Markov random field (MRF). The proposed method takes advantage of both the spectral and spatial information in polarimetric SAR images, and leverages the powerful representation capabilities of the DWT and MRF models.\n\nFirstly, the authors apply the 3D DWT to decompose the polarimetric SAR image into different frequency bands, capturing the spatial and spectral information at multiple scales. Then, they utilize the MRF model to integrate the DWT coefficients from all bands, enforcing spatial consistency and exploiting the contextual relationships between neighboring pixels.\n\nThe proposed method is evaluated on several datasets with different scenarios, including urban and rural areas, and compared with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, it achieves an average increase of 10% in segmentation accuracy compared to the best performing baseline method, while reducing the computational cost by 30%.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n* A novel approach to polarimetric SAR image semantic segmentation based on the combination of 3D DWT and MRF;\n* An effective way to capture both spectral and spatial information in polarimetric SAR images using the 3D DWT;\n* An efficient MRF model that integrates the DWT coefficients from all bands, enhancing the spatial consistency and contextual relationships between pixels;\n* Thorough experimental evaluation demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\n\nThis work has important implications for a wide range of applications, such as military surveillance, disaster response, environmental monitoring, and agricultural management, where accurate semantic segmentation of polarimetric SAR images is crucial.",
    "In this paper, we present a calculation of higher-order relativistic corrections to the process of gluon fragmentation into spin-triplet S-wave quarkonium. We use a perturbative QCD approach, incorporating resummed large logarithmic contributions and exact next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections in the strong coupling constant αs. Our results include all relevant kinematic effects associated with the finite momentum transfer between the gluon and quarkonium states, as well as the full spin dependence of the quarkonium wavefunction. We find that these corrections have a significant impact on the phenomenology of quarkonium production, reducing the scale uncertainty in the theoretical predictions and improving agreement with experimental data. The results provide important insights into the dynamics of quarkonium formation and hadronization, and demonstrate the importance of considering higher-order corrections in precision studies of quantum chromodynamics processes.",
    "In this study, we investigate the anomalous Hall effect in a composite system consisting of Germanium (Ge), Lead (Pb), Manganese (Mn), and Tellurium (Te). The composition of the system is represented as Ge(1-x-y)Pb(x)Mn(y)Te, where x and y are variables that control the concentration of Pb and Mn, respectively.\n\nThe anomalous Hall effect is a phenomenon where the Hall voltage generated by a current flowing through a material exhibits an additional contribution that cannot be explained by the classical Hall effect. This additional contribution is due to the presence of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic fields.\n\nWe observe that the anomalous Hall effect in the Ge(1-x-y)Pb(x)Mn(y)Te composite system shows a non-monotonic dependence on temperature, with a maximum peak at around 20 K. We also find that the magnitude of the anomalous Hall effect increases with increasing concentrations of Pb and Mn.\n\nOur results suggest that the anomalous Hall effect in this composite system arises from the intrinsic properties of the materials and their interactions, rather than external factors such as defects or strain. We propose a theoretical model based on the k-space Berry phase approach to explain our experimental observations.\n\nOur findings have important implications for the development of new materials and devices that exploit the anomalous Hall effect for applications such as spintronics and valleytronics. Furthermore, this work provides insight into the fundamental physics underlying the anomalous Hall effect in complex materials systems, which can guide future research in this field.",
    "Hey fellow riders!\n\nI'm sure some of you may have noticed that I'm in a wheelchair, and I wanted to share my experience of being disabled and riding with all of you.\n\nFirst of all, let me say that it's not easy. There are days when I feel like giving up, when the pain and fatigue get the better of me and I wonder why I even bother trying. But then there are days like today, when I'm out on my bike, feeling the wind in my hair (okay, so maybe not literally, but you know what I mean) and the sun on my face, and I remember why.\n\nRiding gives me a sense of freedom that I don't often get in other areas of my life. As someone who is unable to walk, many everyday activities can be a challenge, from grocery shopping to simply getting around my own home. But on my bike, none of that matters. I'm not limited by my disability, I'm free to go wherever the road takes me.\n\nOf course, there are challenges that come with riding as a disabled person. Finding accessible routes can be tough, and sometimes I have to get creative with my route-planning. And yes, there are definitely days when the pain and fatigue make it harder to ride than others. But the benefits far outweigh the difficulties.\n\nNot only does riding give me a sense of freedom, but it also helps me mentally. It's a way for me to clear my head and relieve stress, which is especially important when dealing with the daily struggles of living with a disability. Plus, it's a great workout - something that's important for everyone, but especially for those of us who may have limitations on our physical activity.\n\nSo, to any other disabled riders out there, I want to say keep at it! Don't let your disability hold you back from experiencing the joy of riding. And to able-bodied riders, please be mindful of accessibility when planning routes and events - a little bit of consideration can go a long way in making the cycling community more inclusive for",
    "The UK government has announced plans to significantly reduce its diplomatic presence around the world, with up to 20 embassies and consulates facing closure or downgrading.\n\nAccording to sources within the Foreign Office, the move is part of a broader effort to streamline operations and make savings in the face of economic uncertainty.\n\n\"In light of the current financial climate, we are reviewing our overseas representation to ensure that it is efficient and effective,\" said a spokesperson for the Foreign Office. \"This may involve closing or downgrading some missions, but we will continue to maintain a strong presence in key countries and regions.\"\n\nThe list of affected embassies and consulates has not been made public, but it is understood that several European countries, as well as some in Africa and Asia, will be impacted.\n\nCritics have expressed concern that the closures could harm British interests abroad, particularly in terms of trade and investment. However, the Foreign Office insists that the changes will allow them to focus resources more effectively and prioritize key relationships.\n\n\"We will continue to work closely with our international partners and maintain our commitment to promoting British values and interests around the world,\" added the spokesperson.\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when many countries are re-evaluating their foreign policy priorities and diplomatic footprint.

    "The sports minister has refused to back down in a growing row over allegations of doping in British sport, insisting that the government is taking the issue seriously and will not be swayed by public pressure.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Minister for Sport Tracey Crouch said she was \"disappointed\" by recent media reports suggesting that the government was not doing enough to tackle the problem of performance-enhancing drug use among athletes.\n\nCrouch pointed out that the UK had some of the strictest anti-doping laws in the world and that her department was working closely with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and other international organizations to address the issue.\n\nShe also highlighted the fact that the government had recently announced plans to increase funding for anti-doping measures, including the establishment of a new national testing centre and increased support for grassroots initiatives aimed at preventing drug use in sport.\n\nDespite these efforts, Crouch acknowledged that there was still work to be done and pledged to continue working with sports bodies and other stakeholders to ensure that British sport remains clean and fair.\n\nThe minister's comments come as a number of high-profile athletes have faced accusations of doping in recent months, leading to renewed calls for greater action from the government and sports authorities.\n\nCritics have accused the government of being too slow to respond to the crisis and of failing to take adequate steps to protect athletes from the risks associated with performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nBut Crouch rejected these claims, saying that the government was committed to protecting the integrity of British sport and would not be swayed by public opinion or political considerations.\n\n\"We are taking this issue very seriously,\" she said. \"We understand the concerns of athletes, fans and sponsors, and we are working hard to address them.\"\n\nCrouch added that the government was determined to create an environment where athletes could compete fairly and safely, and where those who cheated were held accountable for their actions.\n\nThe minister's remarks are likely to be seen as a direct challenge to critics",
    "A rare guitar owned by Jimi Hendrix has been sold at auction for an incredible £100,000. The instrument, a 1968 Fender Stratocaster, was played by the legendary musician during his iconic performance at the Woodstock festival in 1969.\n\nThe guitar was sold to an anonymous buyer at a Christie's auction house in London on Tuesday, exceeding its estimated value of £70,000-£90,000. The sale is a testament to the enduring popularity and influence of Hendrix, who is widely considered one of the greatest musicians of all time.\n\nThe guitar features a distinctive psychedelic paint job, which was applied by Hendrix himself. It also boasts a number of unique modifications, including a reversed tremolo system and a custom-made pickguard. These features make it a truly one-of-a-kind instrument, and a must-have for any serious collector or fan of Hendrix's music.\n\nThe guitar was previously owned by Hendrix's friend and fellow musician, Steve Winwood, who inherited it from Hendrix after his death in 1970. It has since been kept in pristine condition and has only been played a handful of times, making it an extremely rare and valuable piece of rock history.\n\nThe sale of the guitar comes as interest in Hendrix's life and legacy continues to grow, with a new biopic about the musician set to be released later this year. The film, entitled \"All Is By My Side,\" stars OutKast frontman André Benjamin as Hendrix and promises to offer a fresh perspective on the life of the legendary guitarist.\n\nThe sale of the guitar is also a reminder of the enduring power of music memorabilia, with items associated with famous musicians consistently fetching high prices at auction. In recent years, items such as John Lennon's glasses and Michael Jackson's gloves have sold for tens of thousands of pounds, highlighting the deep connection that fans have with their musical heroes.\n\nFor many",

    "Hello fellow Redditors,\n\nI wanted to share some thoughts and information about the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, which is also known as the June Fourth Incident or 六四天安門事件 in Chinese. This event was a turning point in modern Chinese history and had a profound impact on China's political landscape.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about what led up to the protests. In the late 1980s, China was undergoing significant economic and political changes. The Communist Party of China (CPC) had been in power since 1949, and while the country had made great strides in terms of economic development, there were growing concerns among the population about corruption, nepotism, and lack of political freedom.\n\nIn April 1989, Hu Yaobang, a former CPC General Secretary who was known for his progressive views, died. His death sparked a wave of mourning and anger among the people, who saw him as a symbol of hope for change. Students, intellectuals, and other segments of society began to organize protests and demand greater freedoms and an end to corruption.\n\nThe protests started small but quickly gained momentum. On May 20, 1989, students from Beijing University organized a march to Tiananmen Square, where they erected a statue called the \"Goddess of Democracy,\" which became a symbol of their movement.

    "Abstract:\n\nAccurate segmentation of nuclei in immunofluorescence images is a crucial step in various biomedical applications, including cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Deep learning techniques have shown promising results in this task, but are often limited by the availability of high-quality annotated data. In this work, we explore the use of deep learning architectures for generalized immunofluorescence based nuclear image segmentation, where the goal is to develop models that can accurately segment nuclei across different types of tissues and staining protocols. We evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including fully convolutional networks (FCNs), U-Net, and attention-based models, on a large dataset of immunofluorescence images with diverse tissue types and staining patterns. Our results show that FCNs and U-Net achieve high accuracy on most datasets, while attention-based models provide additional improvements in some cases. We also investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning and data augmentation strategies to improve model generalization across different datasets. Our findings suggest that deep learning architectures can be effectively used for generalized immunofluorescence based nuclear image segmentation, and highlight the importance of carefully selecting appropriate architectures and training strategies for specific application scenarios.",
    "In this paper, we investigate the use of WS2 (tungsten disulfide) as a saturable absorber for ultrafast photonic applications of mode-locked and Q-switched lasers. We demonstrate that WS2 exhibits a high saturation intensity and a fast recovery time, making it an ideal material for these applications. By incorporating WS2 into a cavity design, we achieve efficient passive mode locking and Q-switching in a fiber laser, with operation at speeds of up to 100 GHz. The use of WS2 offers several advantages over traditional saturable absorbers, including low cost, ease of integration, and broadband absorption. Our results pave the way for the development of high-speed, compact, and efficient photonic devices based on WS2.",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image-to-image translation tasks, which is a fundamental problem in computer vision that involves converting an input image from one domain to another while preserving its semantic meaning. Unlike traditional supervised methods that require paired training data, our proposed method leverages large amounts of unpaired data to learn a robust and generalizable mapping between domains.\n\nWe introduce a semi-supervised learning framework that combines both labeled and unlabeled data to train a deep neural network for image-to-image translation. Our approach utilizes a dual-teacher strategy, where two separate teachers are employed to guide the learning process: a supervised teacher that provides explicit guidance using labeled data, and an unsupervised teacher that encourages the model to explore the structure of the data using unlabeled data. The two teachers are combined using a carefully designed loss function that balances the supervised and unsupervised signals, enabling the model to leverage both sources of information effectively.\n\nExtensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our semi-supervised approach compared to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. We show that our method can generate high-quality translations with improved accuracy and diversity, and outperform previous approaches in various challenging scenarios such as handling diverse lighting conditions, poses, and styles.\n\nOur work has significant implications for real-world applications where paired data is scarce or difficult to obtain. By exploiting large amounts of unlabeled data, our method offers a promising solution for tackling image-to-image translation tasks in a more efficient and effective manner.",
    "This paper proposes a novel approach to overhead image segmentation using deep learning, specifically focusing on generalization capabilities through the application of Getis-Ord Gi\\* pooling. Overhead images present unique challenges in terms of variability in lighting, shadows, and object orientation, which can limit the performance of traditional deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose a framework that leverages Getis-Ord Gi\\* pooling to integrate spatial and contextual information from different regions of the image.\n\nOur proposed method consists of two stages: (1) feature extraction using a pre-trained CNN, followed by (2) Getis-Ord Gi\\* pooling and upsampling to generate the final segmentation mask. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including satellite imagery and aerial photography, and demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n\nThe key contribution of this work is the introduction of Getis-Ord Gi\\* pooling into the field of overhead image segmentation, which enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and improve overall accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of different pooling strategies and provide insights into the optimal choice of parameters for best performance.\n\nThe main findings of this research are:\n\n* Getis-Ord Gi\\* pooling significantly improves the performance of deep models for overhead image segmentation, outperforming traditional pooling methods.\n* The integration of spatial and contextual information through Getis-Ord Gi\\* pooling enhances the model's ability to generalize to new images and unseen data.\n* Careful selection of pooling parameters is crucial for achieving optimal performance, and our experiments provide guidance on choosing the appropriate parameters for a given dataset.\n\nThis study has important implications for applications such as crop classification, land cover mapping, and object detection in remote sensing, where accurate segmentation is critical. Our proposed method demonstrates a significant step forward in the development of robust and reliable deep learning models for overhead image analysis.",

    "The internet is set to expand its domain name system (DNS) with the introduction of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the nonprofit organization responsible for managing the DNS, has announced that it has made significant progress in the rollout of these new domains.\n\nThe new gTLDs are designed to provide more options for businesses and individuals looking to establish an online presence. Currently, the internet uses a limited number of generic TLDs such as .com, .org, and .net, as well as country-code TLDs like .uk or .de. However, with the growing demand for unique and memorable domain names, ICANN has been working to expand the range of available options.\n\nAccording to ICANN, over 1,000 new gTLDs have already been delegated, meaning they are now live on the internet and available for use by registrants. This includes brands like .apple, .google, and .amazon, as well as geographic regions like .nyc and .tokyo. In addition, there are also new generic TLDs like .online, .site, and .tech, which offer alternatives to traditional extensions like .com.\n\n\"This is an exciting time for the internet community,\" said Göran Marby, President and CEO of ICANN. \"The expansion of the domain name system represents a major milestone in the history of the internet.

    "Hayao Miyazaki's \"Spirited Away\" is a timeless masterpiece that has left me in awe with its enchanting storytelling, breathtaking animation, and profound themes. The film tells the story of Chihiro, a young girl who finds herself trapped in a spirit world, where she must work in a bathhouse for spirits to survive.\n\nThe animation is simply stunning, with each frame bursting with life and color. The attention to detail in every aspect of the film's visual design is evident, from the intricate character designs to the beautifully rendered backgrounds. The film's score perfectly complements the visuals, adding depth and emotion to each scene.\n\nBut what truly sets \"Spirited Away\" apart is its thought-provoking themes. The film explores the idea of identity, growth, and redemption in a way that is both poignant and accessible to audiences of all ages. Chihiro's journey is one of self-discovery, as she learns to let go of her fears and embrace her inner strength. The film also touches on issues of environmentalism, highlighting the importance of respecting and preserving nature.\n\nThe characters in \"Spirited Away\" are diverse and memorable, each with their own unique personalities and motivations. Chihiro's interactions with the various spirits she encounters are often humorous and heartwarming, but also serve to illuminate the complexities of human nature. The voice acting in the English dub is exceptional, bringing each character to life with nuance and emotion.\n\nIn short, \"Spirited Away\" is a cinematic experience like no other. It is a film that will captivate your imagination, inspire your creativity, and leave you changed in ways you never expected. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible. And if you have already seen it, watch it again – it's a film that only gets better with repeated viewings.",
    "I recently watched \"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\" and was left feeling underwhelmed. Despite its promising trailers, this film failed to deliver on many fronts.\n\nFirstly, the storyline was predictable and lacked depth. The main character, Dastan, is a prince who is accused of murdering his father and must clear his name. Along the way, he meets Tamina, a princess who holds the key to a powerful artifact that can control time. Their journey together is filled with action-packed sequences, but the plot twists are telegraphed from a mile away. The characters' motivations were also unclear, making it difficult to invest in their plight.\n\nFurthermore, the dialogue was cringe-worthy at times, with cheesy one-liners that took me out of the moment. The acting wasn't much better, with Jake Gyllenhaal struggling to convey emotion as Dastan. Gemma Arterton fared slightly better as Tamina, but her character was poorly written and lacked agency.\n\nOne aspect where the film truly faltered was in its representation of Middle Eastern culture. From the clichéd accents to the stereotypical depiction of Persian royalty, it felt like a caricature rather than an authentic portrayal. It's disappointing that Hollywood still hasn't learned how to properly represent diverse cultures without resorting to tired tropes.\n\nThe visual effects were a bright spot, however. The sand powers were impressively rendered, and the parkour scenes through the streets of Alamut were breathtaking. But even these aspects couldn't save the film from its overall mediocrity.\n\nOverall, \"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\" was a letdown. With a weak story, subpar acting, and problematic cultural representation, there are far better ways to spend your time. If you're looking for a fun, mindless adventure, you might enjoy this film, but don't expect anything more substantial.",

    "In this paper, we present a novel approach for interactive segmentation of medical images using fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs). Traditional image segmentation methods rely on manual annotation of boundaries, which can be time-consuming and expertise-demanding. Our proposed method leverages FCNs to learn a pixel-wise classification model that can be interactively refined by users.\n\nWe propose a two-stage framework, consisting of an initial segmentation stage followed by a refinement stage. In the initial segmentation stage, we use a pre-trained FCN to generate an initial segmentation mask. This mask is then used as input to the refinement stage, where user interactions are incorporated into the segmentation process. We employ a feedback mechanism that allows users to correct errors in the initial segmentation, resulting in a more accurate final segmentation mask.\n\nOur proposed method has several advantages over traditional segmentation techniques. Firstly, it eliminates the need for manual annotation of boundaries, reducing the time and effort required for segmentation. Secondly, it enables real-time interaction with the user, allowing for immediate feedback and correction of errors. Finally, our method can be easily extended to handle various types of medical images, including MRI, CT, and X-ray scans.\n\nWe evaluate our method on several datasets of medical images and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to traditional segmentation methods. The results show that our method produces high-quality segmentation masks with improved accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we conduct a user study to assess the usability of our method and find that users are able to quickly and accurately refine the initial segmentation masks with minimal effort.\n\nIn conclusion, our proposed method represents a significant advancement in medical image segmentation, offering a fast, efficient, and interactive solution for clinicians and researchers. With its ability to accommodate diverse types of medical images and user inputs, our method has the potential to revolutionize the field of medical imaging analysis.",

Despite the fact that women's tennis has grown significantly in popularity over recent years, female players continue to earn less than their male counterparts.\n\n\"The pay gap between men and women at Wimbledon is unacceptable,\" said Davenport. \"Female players work just as hard and put in the same amount of effort as the men, yet we don't receive equal compensation. It sends a message that our contributions aren't valued equally.\"\n\nIn addition to the pay gap, Davenport also criticized the scheduling of women's matches at Wimbledon. Women's matches are often relegated to smaller courts and scheduled at less desirable times, while men's matches take center stage on the main show courts.\n\n\"It's disrespectful to the women's game to have us playing on outside courts while the men get all the prime-time slots,\" said Davenport. \"We deserve better. The fans want to watch us play, and we deserve to be showcased on the biggest stages.\"\n\nDavenport's comments come after a successful season for women's tennis, which saw record attendance figures and increased viewership.

    "The discovery of quasi-free positronium (Ps) states in the gas phase has been a topic of great interest in recent years, as it provides valuable insights into the fundamental properties of positronium and its interactions with surrounding molecules. In this study, we report the observation of a quasi-free Ps state in the gas-phase infrared spectra of glycerol using a novel experimental technique called GiPS-AMOC (Gas-Phase Infrared Spectroscopy - Adiabatic Molecular Orbital Calculations). This technique allows for the detection of weak absorption bands associated with transitions to short-lived excited electronic states, which are not accessible by traditional spectroscopic methods. By analyzing the observed spectral features and comparing them with ab initio calculations, we provide strong evidence for the existence of a quasi-free Ps state in glycerol. Our findings open up new possibilities for studying the behavior of positronium in complex environments and shed light on the role of electron-positron correlation in molecular systems.",

    "Hey fellow nurses! I wanted to bring up a topic that's been on my mind lately - the Cures Act and its impact on our nursing notes.\n\nFor those who may not be familiar, the Cures Act is a federal law passed in 2016 that aimed to promote interoperability and improve access to health information technology. One of the provisions of this law requires healthcare providers to give patients electronic access to their medical records, including clinical notes, by 2024.\n\nNow, as nurses, we all know how important accurate and detailed documentation is for providing high-quality patient care. But with the Cures Act, it seems like there's an added layer of complexity when it comes to our nursing notes. We need to make sure that our notes are not only thorough and accurate but also easily understandable for patients who may not have a medical background.\n\nI've heard some concerns from colleagues about the potential risks of sharing raw clinical data with patients. What if they misinterpret something or get upset about something we wrote? It's definitely food for thought, especially considering the emotional nature of some patient situations.\n\nBut at the same time, I believe that empowering patients with more information can ultimately lead to better outcomes. When patients have a clearer understanding of their condition and treatment plan, they're more likely to take an active role in managing their health. And let's be real, who doesn't love the idea of patients being more engaged in their own care?\n\nSo, what do you guys think? Have any of you started preparing for the Cures Act requirements yet?

I've tried restarting my Nautilus, reinstalling the app, and even factory resetting my device, but nothing seems to work.\n\nThe glass bead milestone is also giving me trouble. Every time I try to claim it, I get an error message saying that there was an issue with the transaction. I've checked my internet connection, tried different browsers, and even tried using a VPN, but still no luck.\n\nHas anyone else encountered these problems? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to urban scene segmentation using semi-supervised learning. Our method leverages naive students' annotations of video sequences to train a deep neural network that accurately segments urban scenes into their constituent parts. We introduce a new algorithm called Naive-Student, which combines the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to improve the accuracy of scene segmentation.\n\nExisting approaches to urban scene segmentation rely heavily on fully supervised learning methods, which require large amounts of labeled data. However, obtaining high-quality labels for urban scenes is time-consuming and expensive. To address this challenge, we explore the use of naive student annotators who can provide partial labels for the videos at a lower cost.\n\nOur proposed method consists of two stages. The first stage involves training a deep neural network using weakly labeled data from naive student annotators. This network generates an initial segmentation mask for each frame in the video sequence. The second stage refines the initial segmentation mask by incorporating spatial and temporal smoothing constraints. We evaluate our method on several publicly available datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods while reducing the need for fully labeled data.\n\nThe key contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for urban scene segmentation that leverages naive student annotators; (2) we develop a new algorithm called Naive-Student that integrates both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques; and (3) we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on real-world datasets.\n\nOur work has important implications for improving the efficiency and scalability of urban scene segmentation tasks, particularly in scenarios where fully labeled data is scarce or difficult to obtain.",

    "Home Secretary Charles Clarke has announced that the government will continue to push ahead with its controversial plans for identity cards, despite mounting opposition and concerns over their effectiveness.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in London, Clarke insisted that the introduction of ID cards was essential for improving national security and tackling illegal immigration. He argued that the cards would provide a secure and reliable way to verify individuals' identities, making it easier to track down and prosecute those who break the law.\n\n\"ID cards are a vital tool in our fight against crime and terrorism,\" Clarke said. \"They will help us to protect our citizens and ensure that those who seek to do us harm are brought to justice.\"\n\nHowever, critics of the scheme have questioned whether ID cards will actually be effective in preventing terrorism or crime. They point out that many terrorists and criminals use fake IDs or stolen identities, which would not be detected by an ID card system. Others argue that the cards could create a culture of suspicion and mistrust, where innocent people are treated as potential threats simply because they lack the proper identification.\n\nThe government has also faced criticism over the cost of implementing the ID card system, which is expected to run into billions of pounds. Some experts have warned that the cost could spiral out of control, as the technology required to support the cards becomes more complex and difficult to implement.\n\nDespite these concerns, Clarke remains committed to pushing ahead with the ID card scheme. He has promised to introduce legislation in the coming months that will pave the way for the introduction of compulsory ID cards for all British citizens. The government hopes to begin issuing cards within the next few years, although exact timelines have yet to be confirmed.\n\nOpposition parties have vowed to fight the proposals every step of the way, accusing the government of trying to turn Britain into a surveillance state. Civil liberties groups have also expressed concern about the impact of ID cards on individual privacy and freedom.\n\nBut Clarke remains undeterred, insisting that the benefits of ID cards far outweigh any perceived drawbacks. \"We cannot afford to wait any longer,\" he said",
    "This paper proposes a novel approach to retinal vessel segmentation using generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the presence of extreme low annotation. Retinal vessel segmentation is an important task in medical imaging, as it can help diagnose and monitor various ocular diseases. However, annotating images for this task is time-consuming and expensive, particularly when dealing with rare or subtle conditions.\n\nTo address this challenge, we propose a GAN-based method that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a robust representation of retinal vessels. Our approach consists of two main components: a generator network that produces synthetic images with realistic vessel patterns, and a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and synthetic images. The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously, with the goal of improving the generator's ability to generate realistic images while also enhancing the discriminator's accuracy in detecting real images.\n\nWe evaluate our approach on a dataset of fundus images with varying levels of annotation scarcity and compare its performance against state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that our GAN-based approach outperforms traditional supervised learning methods, especially when annotations are limited. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-quality vessel maps from raw image data, which could potentially reduce the need for manual annotation in future studies.\n\nOur work has significant implications for the development of automated retinal vessel segmentation systems, particularly in scenarios where annotated data is scarce or difficult to obtain. By exploiting the vast amount of unlabeled data available, our approach offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of manual annotation and improve the efficiency and accuracy of retinal vessel segmentation tasks.",
    "Wind River is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that delves into the complexities of grief, trauma, and the struggles faced by indigenous communities. The film tells the story of Cory Lambert, a wildlife tracker who teams up with FBI agent Jane Banner to solve the murder of a young Native American woman on a Wyoming reservation.\n\nThe film's strongest aspect is its cast, which features outstanding performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen. Renner brings depth and nuance to his portrayal of Cory, a man haunted by past tragedy and struggling to come to terms with his own identity. Olsen shines as Jane, a determined but inexperienced agent who finds herself out of her element in the rugged landscape of the reservation. The supporting cast, including Gil Birmingham and Graham Greene, also deliver standout performances that add richness and texture to the film.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Wind River is its setting. The film takes place on the Wind River Indian Reservation, and the harsh, unforgiving landscape serves as both a backdrop and a character in its own right. The cinematography captures the beauty and isolation of the region, highlighting the ways in which the environment shapes the lives of those who live there.\n\nThe themes explored in Wind River are equally impressive. The film tackles issues such as sexual assault, drug abuse, and systemic racism within native communities, all while avoiding patronizing or exploitative depictions. Instead, it offers a nuanced examination of these issues, revealing their complexity and the ways in which they intersect with one another.\n\nWhere the film falls short is in its pacing. At times, the plot feels overly deliberate, with long stretches of exposition that slow down the momentum. Additionally, some characters feel underdeveloped, particularly in comparison to Cory and Jane. However, these flaws do little to detract from the overall impact of the film.\n\nOverall, Wind River is a powerful and moving experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the talent of writer-director",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to prostate magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation using a boundary-weighted domain adaptive neural network (BW-DANN). Prostate MRI segmentation is a challenging task due to variations in image quality and the complexity of the prostate gland's shape and location. Existing methods often rely on manually crafted features or require extensive annotated data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.\n\nOur proposed method addresses these limitations by leveraging a domain adaptation technique that incorporates knowledge from both source and target domains to improve segmentation accuracy. We introduce a boundary-weighted loss function that emphasizes the importance of accurate boundary detection, particularly in regions with high variability. Additionally, we employ a spatial attention mechanism to focus the network's learning on the most relevant regions of the image.\n\nWe evaluate our method on a dataset of 104 prostate MRI images and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show an average Dice similarity coefficient of 86.5%, outperforming the closest competitor by 3.7%. Furthermore, we perform a series of ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of the key components of our method, providing insights into the contributions of the boundary-weighted loss and spatial attention mechanisms.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n\n* A novel boundary-weighted domain adaptive neural network (BW-DANN) for prostate MRI segmentation\n* Introduction of a boundary-weighted loss function to emphasize accurate boundary detection\n* Integration of a spatial attention mechanism to focus the network's learning on relevant regions\n* Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset\n* Insights into the effects of the boundary-weighted loss and spatial attention mechanisms through ablation studies\n\nThis study has important implications for improving the accuracy and efficiency of prostate MRI segmentation, which can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. The proposed method has the potential to be applied in clinical settings, where it can help reduce the time and effort required for manual segmentation",
    "India has taken a major step towards liberalizing its aviation industry, announcing plans to open up its skies to greater competition.\n\nIn a move that could have significant implications for air travel in the country, the Indian government has decided to remove restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic airlines, allowing international carriers to take up to 49% stake in local airlines.\n\nThe decision, which was announced by the Ministry of Civil Aviation on Wednesday, is aimed at attracting more investment into the sector and increasing competition among airlines. It is expected to lead to lower fares, better services and increased connectivity for passengers.\n\nAt present, foreign airlines are allowed to own only up to 26% stake in Indian carriers, with the remaining 74% being held by domestic investors. The new policy change will allow foreign carriers to increase their stake to 49%, making it easier for them to partner with local airlines and expand their operations in the country.\n\n\"This is a historic moment for Indian aviation,\" said Minister of Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri. \"We believe that this decision will bring in much-needed investment and expertise, and help us achieve our vision of making air travel accessible and affordable for all Indians.\"\n\nThe move is likely to benefit both domestic and international carriers operating in India. Local airlines such as IndiGo, SpiceJet and Air India will now be able to access capital from foreign investors, helping them to expand their fleet and route network. International carriers like Emirates, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines, which already have significant presence in India, will also be able to strengthen their partnerships with local airlines and offer more flights to destinations around the world.\n\nHowever, some analysts have expressed concerns about the potential impact on smaller regional airlines, who may struggle to compete with larger players. \"While the move is positive overall, we need to ensure that small regional airlines are protected and given a level playing field,\" said Kapil Kaul, CEO of Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA).\n\nDespite these concerns, most experts agree that opening up the",
    "The Weakly-Labeled Rand Index: A Novel Evaluation Metric for Imbalanced Datasets\n\nAbstract:\n\nEvaluating the performance of machine learning models on imbalanced datasets remains a challenging task, as traditional metrics may be biased towards the majority class. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation metric called the weakly-labeled Rand index (WLRI), which addresses this issue by utilizing weak label information to provide a more accurate assessment of model performance.\n\nThe WLRI is based on the concept of rand indexing, which measures the similarity between two sets of labels. However, unlike traditional rand indexing methods that require full label information, the WLRI exploits the structure of imbalanced datasets and leverages weak label information to estimate the missing labels. This allows for the efficient evaluation of model performance even when full label information is not available.\n\nWe conduct an extensive experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of the WLRI in comparison to existing metrics. Our results demonstrate that the WLRI outperforms traditional metrics in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in cases where the dataset is highly imbalanced or contains noisy labels. Additionally, we show that the WLRI can be used to identify instances where the model's predictions are inconsistent with the weak label information, providing valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of the model.\n\nOur findings have important implications for applications where model performance evaluation is critical, such as medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and credit risk assessment. By using the WLRI, practitioners can gain a more nuanced understanding of their model's performance and make informed decisions about its deployment.\n\nIn summary, the weakly-labeled Rand index offers a promising solution to the challenge of evaluating model performance on imbalanced datasets with incomplete label information. Its ability to leverage weak label information makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, and its robustness to noise and imbalance ensures that it provides reliable and accurate assessments of model performance.",

    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to polyp segmentation using deep ensembles based on stochastic activation selection. Colon polyps are abnormal growths on the colon wall that can potentially develop into cancerous tumors, and accurate segmentation of these polyps from computed tomography (CT) scans is crucial for early detection and treatment.\n\nExisting approaches to polyp segmentation have limitations in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly when dealing with large and complex polyps. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning-based method that combines the strengths of ensemble learning and stochastic activation selection. Our proposed method consists of multiple deep neural networks with different architectures and hyperparameters, each trained on a subset of the dataset. The outputs from these networks are combined using a novel fusion strategy that selects the most relevant activations from each network.\n\nWe evaluate our method on a benchmark dataset of CT scans and compare it to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. We also perform a series of ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of different components of our method and demonstrate its robustness to various parameter settings.\n\nOur main contributions include:\n\n* A novel deep ensemble learning framework for polyp segmentation that leverages stochastic activation selection to improve accuracy and efficiency.\n* A new fusion strategy that selectively combines the most informative activations from multiple deep neural networks, leading to improved performance and reduced computational cost.\n* An extensive evaluation of our method on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches and providing insights into the optimal design choices for polyp segmentation systems.\n\nOverall, our work has important implications for the development of accurate and efficient polyp segmentation systems, which can help improve the early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer.",
    "Hey guys, I'm struggling with something and I don't know how to deal with it. So, I've been in an abusive relationship for a while now, and it's been really tough to handle. The thing is, my partner is a woman, and I'm a guy, and I feel like admitting that she's been abusing me makes me look weak or less of a man or something.\n\nIt started small at first, with her getting angry and yelling at me all the time, but it escalated quickly to physical violence. She would hit me, push me around, and even threaten me with weapons. It's gotten to the point where I'm constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing when she'll snap again.\n\nThe worst part is that I feel so ashamed about it.

    "In a landmark ruling, the Iraqi government has been ordered to pay compensation to the families of civilians who died in a controversial US-led military operation in 2006. The case, which was brought by human rights lawyers, marks a significant victory for the victims' families and sets an important precedent for accountability in the country's troubled past.\n\nThe case centers on a incident in which US forces killed 17 civilians, including women and children, during a raid on the town of Ishaqi in central Iraq. The operation, which was carried out by US soldiers and their Iraqi counterparts, sparked widespread outrage at the time, with many questioning the use of excessive force and the killing of innocent civilians.\n\nDespite initial denials by the US military that any wrongdoing had occurred, it later emerged that the soldiers involved had used disproportionate force and failed to follow proper procedures. An investigation into the incident found that the troops had acted unlawfully, leading to calls for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\nThe legal battle has dragged on for years, with the Iraqi government initially resisting attempts to hold them accountable. However, in a surprise move, the country's Supreme Court ruled this week that the government must pay compensation to the families of the victims.\n\nThe decision is seen as a major breakthrough in efforts to bring justice to the victims of Iraq's conflict, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives since the US-led invasion in 2003. It also highlights the growing power of Iraq's judiciary, which has increasingly sought to assert its independence from political pressure.\n\n\"This ruling sends a clear message that those who commit human rights abuses will be held accountable,\" said Amnesty International's Iraq researcher, Razaw Salihy. \"It's a crucial step towards justice for the countless civilians who have suffered at the hands of armed groups and security forces.\"\n\nThe ruling comes at a sensitive time in Iraq, where tensions are high following months of",
    "In this paper, we demonstrate ultrafast photodetection in the quantum wells of single AlGaAs/GaAs-based nanowires using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. The nanowires were synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy and characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. We observed strong photoluminescence emission from the quantum wells, which was found to be highly sensitive to incident laser power and excitation duration.\n\nUsing a femtosecond pulsed laser source, we achieved ultrafast photoexcitation of the quantum wells, resulting in sub-picosecond photoluminescence decay times. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements revealed that the photocarrier relaxation dynamics in the quantum wells are strongly influenced by the confinement potential and the quality of the nanowire. By comparing our experimental results with simulations based on a rate equation model, we were able to extract important parameters such as carrier lifetime, recombination rate, and Auger recombination coefficient.\n\nOur findings demonstrate the great potential of AlGaAs/GaAs-based nanowires for ultrafast photodetection applications, particularly in the context of high-speed data communication systems. Furthermore, our study provides valuable insights into the fundamental physics governing photocarrier dynamics in quantum wells, highlighting the importance of material quality and confinement effects in achieving efficient and fast photodetection.",

    "George Miller's return to the Mad Max franchise is nothing short of triumphant. After a 30-year hiatus, he brings us a film that not only honors the spirit of the original trilogy but also manages to surpass it in terms of action, storytelling, and sheer adrenaline-fueled excitement.\n\nThe post-apocalyptic wasteland that Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) finds himself in is a visually stunning and hauntingly realistic representation of what our world could become if we continue down the path of destruction and chaos. The set pieces are breathtaking in their scope and imagination, with vehicles and characters that seem to defy gravity and logic at every turn.\n\nBut what sets Fury Road apart from other action films is its strong feminist message. Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa is a force to be reckoned with - a powerful warrior who is driven by her own sense of purpose and conviction. She steals the show in every scene she's in, and her chemistry with Max is electric. The supporting cast of women, including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Riley Keough, also deliver standout performances that add depth and complexity to the film's themes of female empowerment.\n\nHardy's performance as Max is also worthy of mention. He brings a sense of vulnerability and humanity to the character that we haven't seen before, making him more relatable and sympathetic than ever before. His interactions with Furiosa and the other women in the film are nuanced and multi-layered, adding depth to the story and subverting traditional gender roles in a way that feels both natural and refreshing.\n\nThe action sequences are some of the most intense and thrilling you'll ever see on screen. The stunt work is jaw-dropping, with cars, motorcycles, and even a flamethrower guitar all getting their moment to shine. But it's not just mindless mayhem - there's a sense of purpose behind each action sequence, driving the plot forward and deepening our understanding of the characters and",

    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to referring image segmentation called Encoder Fusion Network with Co-Attention Embedding (EFN-CAE). Referring image segmentation is the task of segmenting an object in an image based on a natural language description. Existing methods rely heavily on hand-crafted features and suffer from limited performance.\n\nOur proposed method leverages the power of deep learning to learn a joint representation of visual and linguistic information. The EFN-CAE model consists of two main components: an encoder fusion network and a co-attention embedding layer. The encoder fusion network combines low-level visual features and high-level semantic features to form a hybrid feature representation. The co-attention embedding layer aligns the visual and linguistic features by computing attention weights that indicate the importance of each feature map in the image.\n\nWe evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that the EFN-CAE model outperforms traditional computer vision models that rely solely on visual cues, as well as recent neural network models that use only textual descriptions. We also perform ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of different components of our model and provide insights into the role of each component in improving performance.\n\nThe key contributions of this paper are:\n\n* A novel end-to-end framework for referring image segmentation that integrates both visual and linguistic information.\n* An encoder fusion network that combines low-level visual features and high-level semantic features to form a hybrid feature representation.\n* A co-attention embedding layer that aligns visual and linguistic features by computing attention weights that indicate the importance of each feature map in the image.\n* State-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets for referring image segmentation.\n\nOverall, our work demonstrates the potential of using deep learning techniques for multimodal fusion in various applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and human-computer interaction.",
    "Germany's unemployment rate has fallen to a new record low, according to latest figures released by the Federal Labor Office. The seasonally adjusted jobless rate dropped to 3.1% in March, down from 3.2% in February and below the previous record low of 3.3% set in December last year.\n\nThe number of people out of work also reached a historic low, with just over 1.4 million Germans registered as unemployed. This represents a decline of 100,000 compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe labor office attributed the positive trend to a robust economy, which has been fueled by increased domestic demand and a strong export sector. In addition, mild winter weather conditions have helped boost construction and other industries.\n\nDespite the good news, experts caution that challenges remain on the horizon. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect certain sectors such as tourism and retail, while geopolitical tensions could impact exports in the coming months.\n\nNevertheless, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier hailed the jobs data as a \"sign of the strength and resilience\" of Europe's largest economy. He highlighted the government's efforts to promote employment through vocational training programs and investments in infrastructure projects.\n\nThe opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) welcomed the drop in unemployment but called for more action to address income inequality and precarious working conditions. SPD leader Saskia Esken tweeted: \"Good news on the labor market is always welcome. But we mustn't forget that many people are still struggling to make ends meet.\"\n\nOverall, Germany's impressive labor market performance stands in contrast to the struggles faced by some of its European neighbors. As the EU's economic powerhouse, Germany's success story offers valuable lessons for policymakers seeking to revitalize their own economies.",

    "I'm sitting here with tears streaming down my face, trying to hold myself together as I type this out. My cat, Mr. Whiskers, passed away yesterday and I'm feeling absolutely devastated. He was more than just a pet - he was my best friend, my confidant, my constant companion.\n\nI adopted him from a shelter when he was just a kitten, and we quickly became inseparable. He followed me everywhere around the house, always eager to play or cuddle. He had such a unique personality - he loved playing fetch with his favorite toy, a little stuffed mouse, and he would curl up next to me every night while I watched TV.\n\nOver the past few years, Mr. Whiskers had been dealing with some health issues, but I never expected him to pass away so suddenly. It feels like a part of me has been ripped out, and I don't know how to move forward without him by my side.\n\nI know that losing a pet is something many people have experienced, but it doesn't make it any easier. The pain is real, and it hurts like hell. I feel guilty for crying so much, but at the same time, I can't help it. Losing Mr. Whiskers has left a gaping hole in my life, and I don't know how to fill it.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that if you're reading this and you've lost a beloved pet, please know that you're not alone. It's okay to grieve, it's okay to feel sad, and it's okay to take your time to process your emotions. And if you need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even strangers on the internet (like me!).

    "In this paper, we investigate the extremal properties of flood-filling games, a class of combinatorial games that have been studied extensively in recent years due to their connections to various branches of mathematics and computer science. Our main results provide tight bounds on the maximum number of moves required to reach a given state in a flood-filling game, as well as the minimum number of moves needed to ensure that a certain set of cells is filled with a specific color.\n\nWe first establish upper and lower bounds on the number of moves required to reach a given state in a flood-filling game, showing that the gap between these bounds is at most a constant factor. We then focus on the special case where the initial configuration consists of a single cell filled with a specific color, and prove that the number of moves required to fill the entire grid with the same color is either O(1) or Omega(log n), depending on the size of the grid.\n\nOur next result provides a tight bound on the minimum number of moves needed to ensure that a given set of cells is filled with a specific color. Specifically, we show that it takes at least Omega(sqrt(n)) moves to fill a linear-sized subset of cells with a fixed color, even if the initial configuration contains no cells filled with that color. This lower bound holds even when the grid has a small boundary, and it implies that any algorithm that can solve the game in fewer moves must have a non-trivial strategy.\n\nFinally, we consider the variant of the game where cells can be recolored multiple times during the game. In this setting, we show that there exists an optimal strategy that ensures that all cells are eventually filled with the same color, regardless of the initial configuration. Moreover, we prove that the number of moves required to achieve this outcome grows logarithmically with the size of the grid.\n\nOverall, our results provide new insights into the behavior of flood-filling games, and demonstrate the power and limitations of different strategies for solving these games. The techniques used in this paper combine tools from combinatorics, graph theory, and optimization, and they could be useful in other areas of research where similar questions arise.",

    "Hey fellow fish enthusiasts,\n\nI'm in need of some advice on treating fin rot on my crown tail betta, Luna. I've had her for about a year now and she's been doing great, but over the past week or so I've noticed that her fins have started to look a bit ragged and discolored. Upon closer inspection, I can see that there are small white patches on her fins, especially on the tips, and they seem to be spreading.\n\nI did some research and I'm pretty sure it's fin rot, which I know is a common issue in bettas. My question is, what's the best course of action for treating it? Should I isolate her in a separate tank for treatment, or can I treat her in her current tank? What kind of medication should I use? How long will treatment take? Will it harm any of my other aquatic friends in the tank (I have a few snails and a cory cat)?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!

This paper provides an overview of deep learning techniques and their applications in medical image segmentation. We begin by discussing the fundamentals of deep learning, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and their variants. We then delve into the various applications of deep learning in medical image segmentation, such as tumor detection, organ segmentation, and disease diagnosis.\n\nWe also explore the challenges associated with medical image segmentation, including data scarcity, class imbalance, and variability in image quality. Furthermore, we discuss the strategies used to address these challenges, such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and ensemble learning. Finally, we highlight some of the state-of-the-art deep learning models that have been developed for medical image segmentation, including U-Net, SegNet, and FCN.\n\nOur review demonstrates that deep learning has shown promising results in medical image segmentation, outperforming traditional computer vision approaches. However, there are still several limitations and challenges that need to be addressed before deep learning can be widely adopted in clinical settings. Future research should focus on developing more accurate, robust, and interpretable deep learning models that can handle complex medical images and provide reliable segmentation outputs.",
    "This paper proposes a novel approach to image segmentation using flexibly regularized mixture models. Traditional mixture models are limited by their reliance on fixed parameters, which can result in poor performance when applied to images with varying texture and structure. In contrast, our proposed method allows for flexible regularization of the mixture model, enabling it to adapt to the complexity and variability of real-world images.\n\nWe achieve this flexibility through the use of a novel regularization term that incorporates information about the image structure at multiple scales. This term is combined with a data fidelity term to form a unified objective function that is optimized using an efficient algorithm. The resulting model is able to effectively capture the underlying structure of the image, leading to improved segmentation accuracy compared to traditional methods.\n\nThe effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on several benchmark datasets, including both synthetic and real-world images. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation techniques in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of the contributions of each component of our model, providing insights into the role of flexibility in mixture modeling for image segmentation.\n\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image segmentation by introducing a flexible regularization framework for mixture models. Our approach has important implications for applications where accurate segmentation is critical, such as object recognition, tracking, and medical imaging.",

    "In this paper, we present a novel approach for unsupervised segmentation of 3D medical images based on clustering and deep representation learning. Our method leverages the strengths of both traditional clustering algorithms and deep learning techniques to accurately separate complex structures within medical imaging data.\n\nFirst, we apply a robust clustering algorithm to the input data to identify initial clusters. We then use these clusters as seeds for a deep representation learning model, which learns to embed the data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the spatial relationships between the clusters. This learned representation is used to refine the initial cluster assignments, resulting in improved segmentation accuracy.\n\nWe evaluate our approach on several publicly available datasets of 3D medical images, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and computed tomography (CT) scans. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, we achieve an average dice similarity coefficient of 0.85 across all datasets, representing a significant improvement over the next best approach.\n\nOur work has important implications for a wide range of medical applications, including image-guided surgery, disease diagnosis, and treatment planning. By providing accurate and efficient unsupervised segmentation of 3D medical images, we can enable clinicians and researchers to better understand and analyze complex anatomical structures, leading to improved patient outcomes and advances in medical science.",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called the 2D dilated residual U-Net (DRU-Net) for multi-organ segmentation in thoracic computed tomography (CT) images. The DRU-Net combines the strengths of dilated convolutions and residual connections to improve the accuracy and efficiency of organ segmentation in the thorax.\n\nWe evaluated the performance of the DRU-Net on a publicly available dataset of thoracic CT scans and compared it to several state-of-the-art segmentation models. Our results show that the DRU-Net achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, it achieved an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9364 across all organs, outperforming other models by a significant margin. Additionally, the DRU-Net required fewer parameters and computations than other models, making it more efficient and scalable for clinical applications.\n\nThe key innovation of the DRU-Net is the use of dilated residual connections, which allow the model to capture long-range dependencies between pixels while also reducing the number of parameters and computations required. This enables the model to learn richer feature representations with less computation, leading to improved segmentation performance.\n\nOur experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRU-Net for multi-organ segmentation in thoracic CT images. We believe that this approach has important implications for improving the accuracy and efficiency of image segmentation tasks in medical imaging, particularly in the context of lung disease diagnosis and treatment planning.",
    "The British National Party's (BNP) recent claim that immigration is to blame for the country's economic woes has been rejected by John Howard, the former Australian Prime Minister.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Mr. Howard stated that the idea that immigration is responsible for economic problems is a \"simplistic and misguided\" view. He emphasized that immigration has always played a vital role in shaping the economy and society of both Australia and the UK, bringing new skills, ideas, and perspectives that have contributed to growth and innovation.\n\nMr. Howard also pointed out that many studies have shown that immigration has a positive impact on the economy, including a report by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics which found that immigration has increased GDP per capita by 0.5% per year since 2000.\n\nThe former Prime Minister acknowledged that there are legitimate concerns about the impact of immigration on public services and infrastructure, but argued that these issues can be addressed through effective planning and management. He stressed the need for a balanced approach that takes into account both the economic benefits and social challenges of immigration.\n\nMr. Howard's rejection of the BNP's claims comes as no surprise, given his own government's pro-immigration stance during his time in office. Under his leadership, Australia implemented a points-based system aimed at attracting skilled migrants and refugees, which was widely seen as a success.\n\nHis comments are likely to spark debate within the UK, where the issue of immigration remains a contentious topic. The BNP has been vocal in its opposition to mass immigration, calling for stricter border controls and a halt to what they term \"uncontrolled\" immigration from certain countries.\n\nHowever, Mr. Howard's views are shared by many economists and experts who argue that immigration can bring significant economic benefits, such as filling labor shortages, contributing to innovation, and addressing the challenges posed by an aging population.\n\nOverall, Mr. Howard's rejection of the BNP's claims serves as a reminder that the",
    "In this paper, we present a novel approach for generating discriminative object proposals using submodular ranking. Existing methods for object proposal generation often rely on heuristics or hand-crafted features, which can be limited in their ability to capture complex contextual relationships between objects. In contrast, our method uses submodular ranking to optimize a rich set of features that capture both local and global contextual information.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC and COCO. Our results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recall and precision, while also providing more diverse and meaningful proposals. We also perform a series of ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components of our method, providing insights into the role of each feature and the importance of submodular ranking.\n\nOur main contribution is a new algorithm called SPARK (Submodular Proposal Allocation with Ranking and Kernels), which combines submodular ranking with kernel-based feature representation to generate high-quality object proposals. SPARK iteratively refines the proposal set through a combination of greedy selection and kernel-based merging, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.\n\nOverall, our work provides a significant step forward in the field of object proposal generation, demonstrating the power of submodular ranking for capturing complex contextual relationships in visual data.

    "In this paper, we explore the relationship between Fourier-Mukai theory and autoduality for compactified Jacobians. We begin by introducing the concept of a compactified Jacobian variety and its associated cotangent bundle, and discuss the natural symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle. We then review the definition of a Fourier-Mukai transform and its properties, particularly in the context of compactified Jacobians.\n\nOur main result is the construction of an autoduality theorem for compactified Jacobians, which generalizes the classical Riemann-Roch theorem to these spaces. This theorem establishes a fundamental connection between the geometry and arithmetic of a compactified Jacobian variety, and provides a powerful tool for studying its moduli space of stable bundles.\n\nWe also demonstrate how our autoduality theorem can be applied to study the geometry and topology of compactified Jacobians, including their Picard groups, intermediate Jacobians, and rational points. Our results have important implications for the study of moduli spaces of vector bundles over algebraic curves, and provide new insights into the geometry and arithmetic of these spaces.\n\nOverall, this paper represents a significant advancement in our understanding of compactified Jacobians and their role in number theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. It opens up new directions for research in these fields, and demonstrates the power and versatility of Fourier-Mukai theory as a tool for studying complex geometric objects.",

    "A controversy is unfolding in the world of online advertising, as a new platform that allows individuals to earn money by displaying ads on their personal devices has sparked concerns among regulators and consumer groups.\n\nThe platform, known as PeerAds, enables users to install an app on their smartphones or laptops that displays targeted ads to nearby devices. The app uses Bluetooth technology to detect nearby devices and serve relevant ads based on the user's location and interests. Users are then paid for each ad they display, creating what the company calls a \"peer-to-peer\" advertising network.\n\nBut critics say that the platform raises serious privacy concerns, as it can potentially track users' locations and browsing habits without their consent. They also argue that the app could be used to spread malware or other forms of malicious software.\n\n\"This platform represents a significant threat to consumers' privacy,\" said Sarah Smith, a spokesperson for the Consumer Protection Agency. \"By using Bluetooth technology to track users' movements and serving targeted ads, PeerAds is essentially creating a surveillance state where consumers have no control over their personal data.\"\n\nPeerAds has responded to these concerns by stating that its platform complies with all relevant data protection regulations and that users must explicitly opt-in to participate. The company also claims that it takes measures to protect users' privacy, such as encrypting their data and only collecting information that is necessary for the functioning of the app.\n\nHowever, some experts remain skeptical. \"While PeerAds may have good intentions, the potential risks associated with this platform are simply too great,\" said Dr. Mark Johnson, a cybersecurity expert at the University of London. \"We've seen time and again how companies that collect large amounts of personal data can fail to protect it adequately.

    "In this paper, we present the design and experimental demonstration of a broadband and energy-concentrating terahertz coherent perfect absorber (CPA) based on a self-complementary metasurface. The proposed CPA exploits the concept of self-complementation to achieve high absorption efficiency across a wide range of frequencies, while also concentrating the absorbed energy within a small area.\n\nThe designed metasurface consists of a array of asymmetric split-ring resonators that are arranged in a self-complementary pattern, which enables the structure to exhibit both electric and magnetic resonances. By carefully designing the geometry and arrangement of the resonators, we demonstrate that the CPA can achieve high absorption efficiencies exceeding 90% over a bandwidth of more than 30% of the center frequency.\n\nIn addition, we show that the CPA can concentrate the absorbed energy within a small area, leading to a significant increase in the power density. This property makes it suitable for various applications such as thermal imaging, non-destructive testing, and wireless power transfer.\n\nExperimental results using a prototype CPA fabricated using standard printed circuit board technology confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the broadband and energy-concentrating properties of the proposed CPA. The measured absorbance spectrum shows high absorption efficiency across a wide frequency range, and the spatial distribution of the absorbed power confirms the concentration of energy within a small area.\n\nOur work presents a significant advancement in the field of THz coherent perfect absorbers, and paves the way for the development of novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality.

    "In this paper, we investigate the impact of noisy labeling on the performance of deep learning models for medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we focus on developing effective supervision strategies to mitigate the effects of noisy labels and improve model accuracy.\n\nOur approach is based on a combination of data augmentation techniques and regularization methods, which are applied during training to enhance the robustness of the segmentation model. We evaluate our method on several datasets with varying levels of noise in the labels and compare the results to those obtained using traditional supervision methods.\n\nThe main contribution of this work is the development of a novel distillation-based loss function that incorporates both clean and noisy labeled data during training. This loss function enables the model to learn from both accurate and noisy labels, while also encouraging it to produce more consistent predictions. Our experiments show that this approach leads to improved segmentation performance compared to traditional supervised learning methods, especially when dealing with high levels of label noise.\n\nWe also perform an ablation study to analyze the effectiveness of different components of our proposed method, providing insights into the role of each component in improving model robustness. The results demonstrate that combining data augmentation, regularization, and distillation-based loss functions can significantly improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation models, even in the presence of significant label noise.\n\nOverall, our findings have important implications for real-world applications where labeled data may be subject to errors or inconsistencies. By developing effective supervision strategies for noisy labeled data, we can improve the reliability and generalizability of deep learning models for medical image segmentation and other related tasks.",

    "This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize spectral efficiency in flexi-grid long-haul optical systems. The increasing demand for high-speed data transmission and the growing number of connected devices have led to a significant increase in the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over long distances. Flexi-grid optical systems offer a promising solution by allowing for flexible allocation of bandwidth and wavelength resources, enabling efficient use of available spectrum. However, optimizing spectral efficiency remains a major challenge.\n\nThe proposed approach uses advanced algorithms and numerical optimization techniques to optimize spectral efficiency while taking into account various constraints such as non-linear effects, dispersion, and noise. The proposed approach is evaluated using simulations and testbed experiments, showing significant improvement in spectral efficiency compared to traditional methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can increase the capacity of long-haul optical communication systems, reducing the need for costly infrastructure upgrades and improving overall network performance.\n\nThe paper also discusses the tradeoffs between different design parameters and their impact on system performance, providing valuable insights for system architects and engineers. The proposed approach has important implications for the development of future high-capacity long-haul optical communication systems, enabling more efficient use of available resources and improved Quality of Service (QoS) for users.",
    "In this paper, we present a novel approach to understanding and analyzing boosting algorithms, a class of machine learning algorithms that combine multiple weak models to create a strong predictor. We propose a dual formulation of boosting algorithms, which views the traditional boosting process as a optimization problem over a set of auxiliary variables. This dual formulation provides new insights into the behavior of boosting algorithms and allows us to derive tight bounds on their generalization error.\n\nWe demonstrate the utility of our dual formulation by applying it to several popular boosting algorithms, including AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). Our analysis reveals that these algorithms can be interpreted as solving a convex optimization problem, which enables us to establish strong convergence guarantees for their iterative updates. Furthermore, we show how our dual formulation can be used to design new boosting algorithms that are provably better than existing methods in certain regimes.\n\nOur work has important implications for the development and analysis of boosting algorithms, and demonstrates the power of using dual formulations to gain insight into complex machine learning systems.",

    "This paper proposes a novel approach to image segmentation using a multi-threshold technique based on histogram sampling. The proposed method utilizes the concept of histogram analysis to segregate images into their constituent parts, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of the segmentation process.\n\nExisting methods of image segmentation often suffer from limitations such as high computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and inability to handle complex objects with varying intensities. In contrast, the proposed method uses a combination of histogram analysis and thresholding techniques to overcome these challenges.\n\nThe proposed method consists of three stages: (1) preprocessing, (2) histogram construction, and (3) threshold selection and segmentation. In the preprocessing stage, the input image is filtered to reduce noise and enhance contrast. Next, a histogram is constructed from the intensity values of the preprocessed image. Finally, multiple thresholds are selected from the histogram using an optimized algorithm that minimizes the intraclass variance and maximizes the interclass variance. These thresholds are then used to segment the image into its constituent regions.\n\nThe proposed method was tested on several benchmark datasets, including synthetic and real-world images, and compared with existing segmentation techniques. The results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional thresholding methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, it achieves higher segmentation accuracy while requiring fewer computations.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel multi-threshold technique based on histogram sampling, which significantly improves the performance of image segmentation. The proposed method has important applications in various fields such as object recognition, tracking, and medical imaging.",

    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach for multimodal brain tumor segmentation using the transformer architecture. Our proposed method, called TransBTS, leverages the strengths of transformers in processing sequential data to integrate information from multiple modalities, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).\n\nExisting methods for brain tumor segmentation have limitations in handling complex tumor shapes and heterogeneity, especially when dealing with multi-modal data. The transformer architecture, which has achieved state-of-the-art results in natural language processing tasks, offers a unique opportunity to address these challenges due to its ability to process input sequences of arbitrary length and learn long-range dependencies.\n\nIn TransBTS, we adapt the transformer architecture to handle 3D brain images by dividing them into patches and linearizing them into sequence representations. We then feed these sequences into a encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder extracts high-level features and the decoder generates the segmentation mask. To improve performance, we incorporate a spatial attention mechanism that focuses on relevant regions of the input sequence and enforces spatial consistency between adjacent patches.\n\nWe evaluate TransBTS on a dataset of 20 patients with various types of brain tumors, comparing it to traditional CNN-based approaches and a state-of-the-art multi-modal segmentation method. Our experiments show that TransBTS outperforms these baselines in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, it achieves an average Dice score of 86.5% across all tumor classes, while reducing computational time by approximately 40% compared to the best-performing CNN model.\n\nOur work demonstrates the potential of transformers for multimodal brain tumor segmentation, highlighting their capacity to effectively capture long-range dependencies and handle diverse input data. Future research can build upon our findings to further advance the capabilities of transformer-based models in medical image analysis.",
    "Hey fellow NBA fans! As we approach the off-season, I wanted to bring up a potential trade target that I think could be a great addition to any team: De'Andre Hunter.\n\nHunter is a 24-year-old forward who currently plays for the Atlanta Hawks. In his second season in the league, he's shown some incredible promise, averaging 18.5 points and 3.7 rebounds per game while shooting 46% from the field and 38% from three. He's also demonstrated some impressive defensive skills, with a 7-foot wingspan and quick lateral movement that allows him to guard multiple positions.\n\nOne of the things that really stands out about Hunter is his ability to score efficiently from everywhere on the court. He has a diverse array of moves that allow him to get buckets in a variety of ways, whether it's spotting up from deep, attacking the rim, or pulling up from midrange. He's also got a high basketball IQ and does a great job of moving without the ball, which makes him a valuable asset in any half-court set.\n\nAnother thing that sets Hunter apart is his versatility. At 6'7\", he's got the size and length to play either forward position, and he's comfortable playing both inside and outside. This flexibility would make him a great fit for any team looking to add depth to their frontcourt, especially given his ability to switch seamlessly between scoring and facilitating roles.\n\nSo why do I think Hunter would be a great off-season trade target? For starters, he's still relatively young and has plenty of room to grow, so you'd be getting a player who's only going to improve over time. Additionally, he's shown that he can thrive in a variety of systems, so you know he'll be able to adapt quickly to whatever style your team wants to play. And let's not forget that he's already proven himself as a reliable scorer and defender, which are two crucial qualities that every team needs come playoff time.\n\nOverall, I think De'Andre Hunter would be",

    "In this paper, we present CHASE, a novel approach to visual tracking that leverages cell-level differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) to achieve robust performance. Existing trackers often rely on hand-crafted features and suffer from limited adaptability to changing object appearance or environmental conditions. In contrast, CHASE uses NAS to automatically discover and optimize a set of discriminative features that are robust to various challenges in visual tracking.\n\nOur key innovation is the introduction of a cell-level differentiable rendering module that enables efficient and accurate gradient-based optimization of the feature extractor. This allows us to jointly optimize the feature extraction and classification stages, leading to improved performance and reduced computational cost compared to traditional trackers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CHASE on several benchmark datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, we perform a series of ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components in our framework, providing insights into the role of each component in achieving robust visual tracking. Our work highlights the potential of using NAS for visual tracking tasks and opens up new possibilities for developing more sophisticated and effective trackers in the future.",

    "I've been looking forward to playing Wolfenstein: Youngblood for weeks, but now that I've finally gotten my hands on it, I can barely stomach the thought of continuing.\n\nThe game starts off with an intense action sequence that had me feeling pumped up and ready to take down some Nazis. But as soon as that initial rush wore off, I was hit with a wave of disappointment and frustration. The level design is clunky and confusing, with narrow corridors and poorly marked paths that made me feel like I was wandering around in circles. And don't even get me started on the enemy AI - it's like they're actively trying to be annoying. Enemies will constantly flank you and attack from behind, and there's no way to effectively counter it without resorting to cheap tactics like corner camping.\n\nBut what really gets my goat is the weapon handling. The guns feel so unresponsive and heavy, like I'm lugging around a bunch of lead pipes instead of firearms. And don't even get me started on the sound design - the gunplay sounds like someone hitting a tin can with a wooden spoon. It's like they took all the excitement and visceral satisfaction out of shooting and replaced it with a dull, monotonous drudgery.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the story. Or rather, the complete lack thereof. I've played for 10 whole minutes and I still have no idea what's going on or why I'm doing any of this. There's no context, no character development, nothing. It's just mindless killing for the sake of killing.\n\nOverall, I'm extremely underwhelmed by Wolfenstein: Youngblood. I was expecting a thrilling, action-packed experience, but what I got was a clumsy, unsatisfying mess. I think I'll stick to the older games in the series, which at least had a sense of style and substance to them.",
    "I'm not able to provide medical advice or recommendations, and it would be inappropriate for me to do so. It's important to consult with a qualified healthcare professional before making any changes to your medication regimen, including tapering off benzodiazepines like Klonopin.\n\nTapering off benzodiazepines can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening, as it can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, anxiety, insomnia, and other serious health problems. It's crucial to work closely with a doctor who has experience in safely tapering patients off these types of medications. They will be able to assess your individual situation and develop a personalized plan that takes into account your medical history, current dosage, and other factors.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that stopping benzodiazepines abruptly or reducing the dose too quickly can be harmful. A gradual taper over a period of weeks or months is usually recommended to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms. Your doctor may also consider switching you to a different medication or providing additional support during this time.\n\nIn summary, while I understand that you're looking for information on tapering off Klonopin, it's essential to seek guidance from a qualified healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice and ensure your safety throughout the process.",

    "In this paper, we examine the biases present in Twitter studies on political collective action. We conducted a systematic review of existing research and found that many studies suffer from various forms of bias, including sampling bias, methodological bias, and ideological bias. Sampling bias arises from the use of non-representative samples, such as snowball or convenience samples, which can lead to an overrepresentation of certain groups or perspectives. Methodological bias occurs when researchers rely on flawed methods, such as automated content analysis or sentiment analysis, which can produce inaccurate results. Ideological bias emerges when researchers' own beliefs and values influence their interpretation of data, leading to a skewed representation of political collective action. Our findings highlight the need for more rigorous and reflexive approaches to studying political collective action on Twitter, and suggest that future research should prioritize diverse and representative sample populations, triangulate methods, and critically reflect on the potential impact of researcher bias. By addressing these biases, scholars can better understand the complex dynamics of political collective action in the digital age and contribute to more informed public discourse.",
    "In this paper, we present a novel approach for supporting large models in TensorFlow using graph rewriting. The proposed technique, called TFLMS (TensorFlow Large Model Support), enables the efficient execution of large neural networks on GPUs and other hardware platforms.\n\nExisting approaches for supporting large models in deep learning frameworks often rely on model parallelism or data parallelism, which can result in memory constraints and slow down the training process. In contrast, TFLMS leverages graph rewriting to transform the computation graph into an optimized form that minimizes memory usage and improves performance.\n\nThe key idea behind TFLMS is to decompose the original computation graph into smaller sub-graphs that can be executed independently in parallel. This decomposition is achieved through a series of graph rewriting rules that eliminate unnecessary computations and reduce the memory footprint of the model. The resulting sub-graphs are then scheduled and executed efficiently on available hardware resources.\n\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of TFLMS using several benchmark datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art techniques for large model support. Our results show that TFLMS achieves significant speedups compared to existing methods while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Specifically, we observe up to 3x speedup in training time and up to 5x reduction in memory usage for large ResNet models.\n\nIn addition to its performance benefits, TFLMS also provides flexibility and ease of use. It seamlessly integrates with the TensorFlow framework, allowing developers to use familiar APIs and tools without requiring extensive modifications to their code. Moreover, TFLMS supports a wide range of hardware platforms, including NVIDIA GPUs, CPUs, and TPUs.\n\nOur work demonstrates the potential of graph rewriting for optimizing large models in deep learning frameworks. We believe that TFLMS represents a significant step towards making large-scale machine learning more accessible and practical for researchers and practitioners alike.",

The second stage uses the trained synthesizer to generate textures that are then used to inpaint the missing regions in an image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on several challenging datasets, including natural scenes and urban environments.\n\nOur key contributions include:\n\n* A novel approach for image inpainting of high-resolution textures using CNN texture synthesis\n* A two-stage framework that combines the strengths of CNN texture synthesis and image inpainting\n* State-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved performance compared to existing methods\n\nThe significance of this work lies in its ability to effectively inpaint large missing regions in high-resolution images while preserving the underlying details and structure.

    "In this paper, we investigate the relationship between quantitative volume space form rigidity and lower Ricci curvature bounds in Riemannian manifolds. We prove that if a manifold has a lower Ricci curvature bound, then its volume space form rigidity is quantitatively related to the magnitude of the Ricci curvature bound. Specifically, we show that the volume space form rigidity decreases as the lower Ricci curvature bound increases. This result provides new insights into the interplay between curvature and rigidity in Riemannian geometry and has important implications for applications such as shape analysis and image processing. Our proof combines techniques from differential geometry and geometric analysis, including the use of Bochner's inequality and the Bishop-Gromov theorem. The results have far-reaching consequences for our understanding of the role of curvature in determining the flexibility and rigidity of shapes in three-dimensional spaces.",
    "This paper investigates the shape bifurcation of a spherical dielectric elastomer balloon subjected to internal pressure and electric voltage. The balloon is made of a dielectric elastomer material that exhibits both electrical conductivity and mechanical elasticity. When inflated with air, the balloon experiences an internal pressure that causes it to deform into a non-spherical shape. Additionally, the application of an electric voltage across the balloon induces electrostatic forces that further deform the balloon.\n\nUsing theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we study the effects of internal pressure and electric voltage on the shape of the balloon and identify the conditions under which the balloon undergoes a shape bifurcation. We find that the balloon can adopt multiple stable shapes depending on the magnitude and direction of the applied voltage and pressure.\n\nOur results show that the shape bifurcation of the balloon is influenced by the competition between the internal pressure, which tends to expand the balloon, and the electrostatic forces, which tend to compress it. We also demonstrate that the bifurcation behavior can be controlled by adjusting the level of internal pressure and the strength of the electric field.\n\nThe findings of this study have important implications for the design and control of soft actuators and other devices that rely on dielectric elastomers. By harnessing the ability to manipulate the shape of these materials through the application of electric fields, we can create novel devices with unique properties and capabilities.",
    "I just watched Ron Howard's \"Rush\" and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed! The film tells the story of the rivalry between Formula One drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) during the 1970s, and let me tell you, it's a wild ride from start to finish.\n\nFirst of all, the performances by both leads are top-notch. Hemsworth and Brühl deliver incredible portrayals of two men who are absolutely driven (no pun intended) to be the best in their sport, no matter the cost. Their chemistry on screen is electric, and their characters' contrasting personalities make for some intense and compelling conflicts.\n\nThe racing scenes are, of course, heart-stoppingly thrilling. The sound design and cinematography put you right in the driver's seat, making you feel like you're hurtling down the track at breakneck speeds alongside the actors. And the races themselves are so well-executed that you can't help but feel invested in the outcome, even if you know how they turn out historically.\n\nBut what really sets \"Rush\" apart is its focus on character development. The film doesn't shy away from showing the darker sides of these two men and the sacrifices they made in pursuit of victory. Both Hunt and Lauda are flawed, complex individuals, and the script does an excellent job of exploring their motivations and vulnerabilities.\n\nOverall, \"Rush\" is an exhilarating, visceral experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Even if you're not a fan of F1 racing, this movie is still worth watching for the performances, the drama, and the sheer adrenaline rush it provides. Highly recommended!",
    "The sunspot number is a widely used index of solar activity, but its estimation has been subject to various uncertainties. This paper examines the sources and magnitudes of these uncertainties and their implications for understanding solar activity and its effects on Earth's atmosphere.\n\nUsing historical records and modern observations, we identify and quantify different types of uncertainties in sunspot number data, including observational errors, calibration issues, and instrumental biases. We develop statistical models to estimate these uncertainties and evaluate their impact on the accuracy and reliability of sunspot number series.\n\nOur results show that the sunspot number uncertainty is significantly larger than previously thought, with a total uncertainty of up to 20% in some periods. We find that the largest contributor to this uncertainty is the variability in observers' counting practices, followed by changes in telescope technology and image quality.\n\nThe estimated uncertainties have important implications for studies relying on sunspot numbers. For example, they suggest that some reported trends and correlations between solar activity and atmospheric phenomena may be overestimated or even spurious. Moreover, our analysis reveals that popular methods for normalizing sunspot numbers may not fully remove observer-related biases, leading to potential misinterpretation of long-term solar trends.\n\nThis study highlights the need for more rigorous treatment of uncertainties in sunspot data and encourages further research into the development of improved methods for estimating and correcting for these uncertainties. By better accounting for the limitations of sunspot number data, scientists can enhance the accuracy and reliability of solar-terrestrial research and strengthen our understanding of the complex relationships between the Sun and Earth's climate.",
    "Newcastle and Gloucester played out an enthralling draw in their Premiership clash, with both sides scoring four tries apiece.\n\nThe home side started strongly, with skipper Jamie Blamire crossing the whitewash within the first 10 minutes. However, Gloucester hit back almost immediately through a powerful run from centre Mark Atkinson.\n\nNewcastle regained the lead just before halftime thanks to a try from winger Adam Radwan, but Gloucester refused to let up. They drew level once again early in the second half through a penalty try, awarded after a high tackle on their fullback Tom Marshall.\n\nThe see-saw encounter continued as Newcastle's Joel Hodgson kicked a penalty to put his side ahead, only for Gloucester's Billy Twelvetrees to cancel it out with a three-pointer of his own.\n\nWith time running out, it looked like Gloucester had snatched victory when replacement prop Val Rapati crashed over for a late try. But Newcastle had one last trick up their sleeve, as substitute scrumhalf Louis Schreuder darted over for a score that tied the game at 27-27.\n\nNeither team could find a way to break the deadlock in the remaining minutes, leaving the match finely poised at 27-all come fulltime. The result sees Newcastle move up to fifth place in the table, while Gloucester remain eighth.",
    "In this paper, we present a novel approach for super-real-time facial landmark detection and shape fitting using deep regression of shape model parameters. Existing methods for facial landmark detection are often limited by their reliance on hand-crafted features, slow processing times, and lack of accuracy in real-world scenarios. Our proposed method leverages recent advances in deep learning to overcome these limitations, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and speed.\n\nWe introduce a new neural network architecture that directly regresses the parameters of a 3D face shape model from raw image data. This allows us to simultaneously detect facial landmarks and fit a personalized shape model to the input image, all in a single, efficient step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on several challenging datasets, including a diverse set of faces with varying poses, expressions, and illumination conditions.\n\nOur key contributions include:\n\n* A novel deep learning architecture for direct regression of 3D face shape model parameters from images\n* State-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and speed for facial landmark detection and shape fitting\n* Robustness to variations in pose, expression, and illumination, enabling reliable operation in real-world scenarios\n* Efficient implementation allowing for super-real-time performance (<10ms) on modern GPUs\n\nThe significance of our work lies in its potential applications in various fields such as virtual try-on, avatar creation, human-computer interaction, and facial surgery planning. Our method has the potential to enable new use cases and enhance existing ones, providing more accurate and efficient facial analysis capabilities than ever before.",
    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm struggling with a situation and could use some advice. I recently started dating someone who is great in many ways, but has one habit that is really bothering me. Every time we hang out, they constantly check their phone and respond to messages or scroll through social media. It's like they can't put it down for more than a few minutes at a time.\n\nAt first, I thought maybe they were just excited about something or had a lot going on, but it's been consistent across multiple dates now. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm competing with their phone for their attention. Whenever I try to talk to them or engage in conversation, they'll glance at their phone and then come back to our conversation after responding to whatever message they received.\n\nIt's making me feel pretty ignored and unimportant. I've tried bringing it up with them in a lighthearted way, saying things like \"Hey, are you sure you don't want to put your phone away and focus on us?\" But they always brush it off, saying they need to stay connected for work or that they're just checking in with friends.\n\nI understand that everyone needs to be available sometimes, but this feels excessive. I'm starting to wonder if this is just how they are and if it's something I should accept as part of being with them. Or am I right to feel frustrated and should I communicate my concerns more assertively? Any advice would be appreciated!",
    "Medical image segmentation is a critical task in various medical applications, such as disease diagnosis and treatment planning. However, the accuracy of segmentation results can be affected by various sources of uncertainty, including noise in the imaging process, variability in anatomy, and ambiguity in image features. Quantifying these uncertainties is essential to ensure reliable and robust segmentation results.\n\nNormalizing flows have recently gained popularity in medical image segmentation due to their ability to model complex distributions and generate high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in medical image segmentation using normalizing flows. Our method leverages the invertibility of normalizing flows to compute Bayesian posterior distributions over segmentation labels, allowing us to quantify uncertainty in the segmentation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several challenging medical image segmentation tasks, including brain tumor segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and lung nodule segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans.\n\nOur main contributions are:\n\n1. A novel approach to uncertainty quantification in medical image segmentation using normalizing flows, which enables the estimation of Bayesian posterior distributions over segmentation labels.\n2. An efficient algorithm that combines the strengths of normalizing flows with the accuracy of state-of-the-art segmentation methods, resulting in improved segmentation performance and uncertainty estimates.\n3. Thorough evaluations of our approach on multiple medical image datasets, demonstrating its superiority compared to traditional segmentation methods and other uncertainty quantification techniques.\n4. A detailed analysis of the effects of different components of uncertainty on segmentation performance, providing insights into the factors that contribute most significantly to uncertainty in medical image segmentation.\n\nOur work has significant implications for various medical applications where accurate and uncertain segmentation results are crucial, such as radiation therapy planning, drug development, and clinical decision-making. By providing a principled way to estimate uncertainty in medical image segmentation, our approach can increase confidence in segmentation results and help mitigate potential errors or misclassifications.",

    "In a landmark ruling, the European Union has announced new rights for air passengers, offering greater protection and compensation in cases of flight delays, cancellations, and denied boarding.\n\nUnder the new regulations, which come into effect on January 1st, airlines will be required to pay compensation of up to €600 to passengers who are delayed by more than three hours or have their flights cancelled without prior notice. The amount of compensation will depend on the distance of the flight and the length of the delay.\n\nIn addition to financial compensation, airlines will also be obligated to provide affected passengers with meals, refreshments, and accommodation if necessary. This includes hotel rooms and transport between the airport and the hotel.\n\nThe new rules also give passengers the right to choose an alternative flight if their original flight is cancelled or significantly delayed. If the passenger chooses this option, they must be rebooked on another flight that leaves within four hours of the original departure time.\n\nFurthermore, passengers who are denied boarding due to overbooking will now be entitled to compensation of at least €250, as well as a refund of their ticket price.\n\nAccording to the European Commission, these changes aim to strengthen the rights of air passengers and ensure that they receive fair treatment from airlines.\n\n\"These new rules will make a real difference to passengers' experiences when things go wrong,\" said Violeta Bulc, EU Transport Commissioner. \"We are committed to ensuring that passengers' rights are respected and protected.\"\n\nThe new regulations apply to all flights operated by EU-based carriers, regardless of where they fly in the world. They also cover flights operated by non-EU airlines flying into or out of the EU.\n\nHowever, some airline industry representatives have expressed concerns about the impact of the new rules on their businesses. They argue that increased compensation payouts could lead to higher ticket prices for consumers.\n\nDespite these concerns, consumer groups have welcomed the changes, saying they will help protect passengers from unreasonable delays and disruptions.\n\nOverall, the introduction of these",
    "In this paper, we introduce a new approach to modeling complex systems called quasi-power law ensembles. This method is based on the observation that many natural and social phenomena exhibit power law distributions, but with heavy tails that cannot be fully captured by traditional power law models. Quasi-power law ensembles are constructed by combining multiple power laws with different exponents, allowing for a more flexible and accurate representation of these types of distributions.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of quasi-power law ensembles through several case studies, including the analysis of income inequality, city size distribution, and scientific productivity. Our results show that quasi-power law ensembles provide a better fit to the data than traditional power law models, and can capture important features such as the presence of extreme events or outliers. We also explore the theoretical properties of quasi-power law ensembles, including their ability to converge to pure power laws in certain limits.\n\nOur work has important implications for the study of complex systems, particularly those that exhibit fat-tailed behavior. By providing a more nuanced understanding of these systems, quasi-power law ensembles can help improve predictions and inform policy decisions. Additionally, our approach can be applied to a wide range of fields, from economics and sociology to biology and physics, making it a valuable tool for researchers across many disciplines.",
    "Sure, here's a possible Reddit post:\n\nI know we all have our own struggles with health anxiety, but can we agree that the constant uncertainty is the absolute worst part? It feels like no matter how many tests you take or doctors you see, there's always a lingering doubt in the back of your mind that something is wrong. And Google doesn't help - one minute you're convinced you have cancer, the next you're sure you have a rare disease that only affects three people in the world.\n\nIt's exhausting and it takes over every aspect of your life. You start to avoid activities because you're worried they might trigger a symptom, or you become obsessed with tracking your vital signs to the point where it interferes with work, relationships, everything. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for some kind of sign that I'm okay, but it never comes. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope with the uncertainty of health anxiety?",

    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm here today to answer any questions you might have about living with dyscalculia. I was diagnosed with this learning disorder when I was in elementary school, and it has affected my life in ways that I never could have imagined.\n\nFor those who don't know, dyscalculia is a neurological disability that makes it difficult for me to understand and process mathematical concepts. It's not that I'm just bad at math - it's like my brain is wired differently and struggles to comprehend even the most basic ideas.\n\nGrowing up, I remember feeling so frustrated and embarrassed because I couldn't keep up with my classmates in math class. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't seem to grasp the concepts. My teachers would often get frustrated with me too, which made me feel even worse.\n\nBut despite these challenges, I didn't give up. I worked hard to find ways to compensate for my dyscalculia. I used to spend hours each night re-reading my notes and practicing problems until they became second nature. And slowly but surely, things started to click into place.\n\nToday, I'm proud to say that I've earned a degree in business and work as an accountant. Yeah, you heard that right - someone with dyscalculia working in finance! It may sound strange, but my experience has actually helped me develop some unique skills that have served me well in my career.\n\nSo, what do you want to know? Ask me anything about living with dyscalculia, and I'll do my best to share my experiences and insights. Let's break down some stereotypes and show the world that people with learning disorders can achieve great things!",
    "Sure, here's a possible Reddit post:\n\nI can't believe I used to be a part of that cult. I mean, I wasn't actually a member or anything, but my family was really into it. They would always watch these conference talks and try to convince me to join them. But the more I watched, the more I realized how strange and controlling it all was.\n\nI remember one time, I was trying to explain to my mom why I didn't want to watch the talks with her, and she got so upset. She started crying and telling me that I was missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime, that I was closing myself off to the truth. It was really intense.\n\nBut as I got older, I started to see through all the propaganda and manipulation. I realized that the leaders were using fear and guilt to control people, and that they were twisting scripture to fit their own agendas. It was like a lightbulb went off in my head, and suddenly everything made sense.\n\nNow, I'm so grateful to be free from all of that. I don't have to sit through hours of boring talks, listening to some dude drone on about how the world is going to end if we don't follow their rules. I don't have to feel guilty for not wanting to participate in their rituals or wear their special underwear.\n\nAnd you know what? Life is so much better without all that crap. I can focus on my own spiritual journey, without someone else telling me what to believe or how to live my life. I can spend my Sundays doing things that actually bring me joy, instead of feeling trapped in a room full of people who are just trying to sell me their version of salvation.\n\nSo, to anyone else who has left or is thinking about leaving a cult, I just want to say that you're not alone. It's okay to question authority and seek your own path. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and there's no one right way to",
    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI know we're all excited for 4/20, but let's take a step back and talk about something that's been on my mind lately: 4/16. Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"What's the big deal about 4/16?\" Well, let me tell you.\n\nFirst of all, 4/16 is a palindrome date, which means it reads the same way forward and backward. That's pretty cool, right? It's like a little mathematical treat that we get to enjoy twice a year (the other being 11/11). But beyond its numerical novelty, 4/16 has a certain je ne sais quoi that sets it apart from other dates.\n\nFor one thing, 4/16 is a reminder that sometimes, things don't have to be perfect to be special. Sure, 4/20 gets all the glory with its pot-smoking parties and cannabis-themed memes, but 4/16 has its own unique charm. It's like the underdog of dates – unassuming, yet quietly brilliant in its own way.\n\nMoreover, 4/16 is a great opportunity to practice self-care. With all the stress and pressure surrounding 4/20, it's easy to forget to take care of ourselves. But 4/16 offers us a chance to slow down, take a deep breath, and focus on our well-being. Whether that means meditating, reading a book, or simply taking a walk outside, 4/16 is the perfect day to do it.\n\nFinally, 4/16 is a time to appreciate the little things in life. In a world that often feels overwhelming and chaotic, it's important to remember the beauty in the everyday moments. And what better way to do that than by celebrating a date that's all about symmetry and balance? So go ahead, take a moment to appreciate the pattern on your coffee cup, the sound of birds chirping outside, or the feel of the sun",
    "In this paper, we explore the modification of the optical path in a nonlinear double-slit experiment. The double-slit experiment is a classic demonstration of wave-particle duality, where a beam of particles passing through two parallel slits creates an interference pattern on a screen behind the slits. By introducing a nonlinear element into the system, we observe changes in the interference pattern that are not predicted by classical physics.\n\nWe modify the optical path of the particle beam using a combination of lenses and mirrors to create a nonlinear relationship between the position of the particles and their trajectories. This nonlinearity leads to the formation of higher-order interference patterns, which cannot be explained by the linear superposition principle. We observe an increase in the number of fringes and a change in their spacing, indicating the breakdown of classical wave-particle duality.\n\nOur results demonstrate the ability to manipulate the interference pattern in a double-slit experiment by modifying the optical path, providing new insights into the nature of quantum mechanics and its limitations. These findings have important implications for the study of quantum phenomena and the development of new technologies based on nonlinear optics.",

I received a phone call from a number with a Toronto area code, and when I picked up, the caller ID displayed \"Research\" instead of a person's name or organization. At first, I thought it was a telemarketer or survey company, so my instinct was to hang up immediately. But something about it didn't feel quite right, so I decided to play along and see where it went.\n\nThe woman on the other end introduced herself as a researcher from the University of Toronto, and she sounded legitimate enough. She explained that they were conducting a study on human behavior and decision-making, and that they had chosen me at random to participate. The questions she asked were pretty interesting, actually - things like how I make decisions in various situations, what factors influence my choices, and how I weigh risks and benefits. It wasn't too invasive or time-consuming, and I even found myself enjoying the conversation.\n\nAt the end of the call, she thanked me profusely and offered to compensate me for my time (which was nice).

In this work, we investigate the effects of heavy-tailed disorder on the pinning model. We show that in the presence of heavy-tailed disorder, the system exhibits critical slowing down and an extended critical region, which are characteristic of disordered systems near their critical point. We also demonstrate that the heavy-tailed disorder leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the order parameter on temperature, which can be explained by the existence of multiple stable states separated by metastable barriers. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of magnetic systems subjected to heavy-tailed disorder and have implications for understanding the dynamics of other complex systems.",

    "The left atrium (LA) is a vital organ in the human heart that plays an essential role in cardiac function. Accurate segmentation of LA from other structures in medical images is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning of various cardiovascular diseases. However, manual segmentation can be time-consuming and prone to errors. In this study, we propose a parameter decoupling strategy for semi-supervised 3D LA segmentation using deep learning techniques. Our approach separates the segmentation task into two independent subtasks: feature extraction and label prediction. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone for both tasks. For feature extraction, we employ a pre-trained CNN with transfer learning to extract relevant features from input images. Then, we fine-tune the extracted features using a smaller CNN with fewer parameters. This allows us to reduce the computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. For label prediction, we train another CNN on a small set of manually labeled data to predict labels for each voxel in the image. Finally, we combine the predicted labels with the extracted features to obtain the final segmentation result. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset with significantly reduced computational resources compared to previous methods.",

    "Body:\n\nTraditionalists often oppose transhumanism, which is the idea that humans can and should use technology to enhance their physical and mental abilities beyond what they are naturally capable of. There are several reasons why this may be the case.\n\nFirstly, some traditionalists believe that it goes against the natural order of things. They argue that humans were designed by nature to have certain limitations, and that trying to overcome them through technological means is unnatural and potentially harmful. This perspective is based on a belief in biological determinism, which holds that human behavior and characteristics are largely determined by genetics and evolutionary factors.\n\nSecondly, there are concerns about the potential consequences of transhumanist technologies. For example, if people were able to significantly increase their lifespan or cognitive abilities, it could lead to social inequality and an imbalance in power between those who have access to these technologies and those who don't. Additionally, there are fears that such technologies could be used for nefarious purposes, such as creating super-soldiers or weapons of mass destruction.\n\nFinally, some traditionalists simply don't see the point of pursuing transhumanist technologies. They believe that humans already have enough capabilities to live fulfilling lives, and that any attempts to improve upon these capabilities would be unnecessary and even counterproductive. Instead, they advocate for focusing on improving our society and addressing the world's problems through more conventional means.",

    "The global economy is facing an uncertain future as experts predict that the \"golden age\" of growth will soon come to an end. This warning comes from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has downgraded its forecast for world GDP growth in 2019 and 2020.\n\nAccording to the IMF, global economic growth slowed to 3.5% in 2018, well below the 4.1% predicted just a year ago. And now, it expects growth to fall even further to 3.3% in 2019 and 3.6% in 2020.\n\nThe slowdown in growth is being attributed to a range of factors, including trade tensions between major powers like China and the US, falling commodity prices, and political instability in key markets such as Europe and Latin America.\n\nIn addition, the IMF warns that debt levels are rising rapidly in many countries, with some economies facing unsustainable levels of debt. This could lead to increased risk of default and financial market volatility.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are still opportunities for growth if policymakers can take action to address them. For example, the IMF recommends that governments invest more in infrastructure projects and other initiatives that can stimulate demand and create jobs. It also calls on central banks to use monetary policy tools to support growth, while avoiding excessive inflationary pressures.\n\nOverall, the IMF's message is clear: the golden age of economic growth may be coming to an end, but there are steps that can be taken to ensure a smooth transition into a new era of sustainable development.",
    "In recent years, data augmentation has become a popular technique in deep learning to improve model performance on unseen domains. However, this approach assumes that models need to generalize across all possible unseen domains, which may not always be necessary or desirable. This paper explores when and why it might be unnecessary to use domain-generalizing techniques such as data augmentation, by analyzing the trade-off between domain adaptation and overfitting. We propose a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of different data augmentation strategies based on their ability to balance these competing objectives. Our results show that some types of data augmentation can actually lead to worse performance on unseen domains than using no augmentation at all, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting appropriate methods for each specific task. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into the limitations of current approaches to domain adaptation and suggests new directions for future research.",
    "I've been feeling this way for a while now, and it seems to have intensified recently. No matter what decision we make or action we take, it always feels like it's the wrong one. It's as if we can never win, no matter how hard we try.\n\nIt's frustrating because we put so much effort into making informed decisions based on all available information, but in the end, it still doesn't seem to matter. We may get some short-term benefits from our choices, but ultimately, it feels like everything is leading us down a path towards failure.\n\nThis has been affecting every aspect of my life, from work to relationships to personal goals. I find myself constantly second-guessing my decisions and wondering if there was another option that would have led to better outcomes. But even when I do manage to make a choice with confidence, it often turns out to be the wrong one.\n\nIt's like being stuck in a perpetual state of uncertainty and doubt. And it's starting to wear me down. Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope with the constant fear of making the wrong choice?",
    "In this paper, we propose an algorithm to construct a non-negative low rank and sparse graph from data. The proposed method is based on the idea of using data adaptive features to learn the underlying structure of the graph. We first introduce a new feature selection technique that can efficiently identify important features in high dimensional data. Then, we use these selected features to construct a non-negative matrix representation of the graph. Finally, we apply a low rank approximation and sparsification step to obtain a final graph. Our approach has several advantages over existing methods: it is computationally efficient, it can handle noisy data, and it can capture complex relationships between nodes. We demonstrate our method on real world datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",
    "China has been accused by former Russian oil giant Yukos of playing a role in its breakup and subsequent bankruptcy, according to documents released by the company's former CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\n\nThe allegations come as part of an ongoing legal battle between Russia and Ukraine over ownership of the assets left behind by Yukos after it was sold off in 2004.\n\nIn a statement on his website, Khodorkovsky claimed that he had evidence showing that Chinese officials met with representatives from Yukos in Moscow in 1998 to discuss potential investment opportunities. He also alleged that Beijing provided financial support for the sale of Yukos' assets to Rosneft, the state-owned oil company, which led to the company's collapse.\n\n\"I have documents proving that Chinese officials were involved in the destruction of Yukos,\" Khodorkovsky said. \"They played a key role in the theft of our assets and the liquidation of our company.\"\n\nKhodorkovsky's claims are likely to fuel tensions between Russia and China, two major players in global energy markets. The former CEO has long been critical of Russia's treatment of him and other business leaders, accusing the government of corruption and abuse of power.\n\nRussia has denied any involvement in Yukos' downfall, blaming the company's own mismanagement and debt problems. However, many observers believe that the government used its influence to seize control of Yukos' assets and sell them off at undervalued prices.\n\nUkraine is currently embroiled in a dispute with Russia over ownership of Yukos' assets in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Kyiv argues that the assets should be returned to their rightful owners, while Moscow insists that they belong to Rosneft.",

    "The Bible does indeed contain passages that are often interpreted as condemning homosexuality, particularly in the Old Testament and some parts of the New Testament. For example, Leviticus 18:22 states, \"You shall not lie with a male as you would with a woman; it is an abomination.\" Similarly, Romans 1:26-27 says, \"For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. Likewise, the men abandoned natural sexual relations with women and burned in lust toward one another, committing shameful acts with their own bodies.\"\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these verses have been subject to much debate and interpretation over the years. Some argue that they were written in a different cultural context and should be understood within that framework, while others believe that they still apply today. Ultimately, the question of whether or not the Bible condemns homosexuality is complex and multifaceted, and there are many differing opinions on the matter.",

    "This paper presents polynomial time algorithms for solving bi-criteria, multi-objective and ratio problems in clustering and imaging. The main focus is on the normalized cut problem, which is a widely used objective function in image segmentation and clustering. We propose new methods to solve this problem efficiently by exploiting its underlying structure as a ratio optimization problem. Our approach involves constructing a set of linear constraints that capture the desired properties of the solution, such as minimizing the sum of squared distances between pixels within clusters or maximizing the ratio of cluster sizes. We then use these constraints to formulate the problem as a convex programming problem with multiple objectives, which can be solved using efficient interior point methods. We also extend our approach to handle more general multi-objective problems by introducing additional constraints that enforce specific tradeoffs between different objectives. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through several experiments on real-world images and synthetic data sets.",

    "The present study investigates the global existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions to a chemotaxis-fluid system on general bounded domains. We consider a system of partial differential equations that describes the movement of a fluid with chemical gradients, where the velocity field is determined by both the Navier-Stokes equation and the gradient descent equation for the concentration field. We prove the global existence of smooth solutions to this system using an energy method, and we also establish the convergence rate of these solutions as time goes to infinity. Our results hold for arbitrary initial conditions and general bounded domains, which extends previous work on this topic.",
    "The field of natural language processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements in recent years, but these models often struggle to generalize across different domains. This is particularly problematic when working with limited data or when dealing with partial datasets that are not representative of the entire domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called mDALU (Multi-Source Domain Adaptation and Label Unification with Partial Datasets), which addresses these challenges by leveraging multiple sources of information and adapting them to a common label space. Our method involves first identifying relevant features from each source dataset using unsupervised learning techniques, followed by training a multi-task model on these features. We then use transfer learning to adapt the model to new domains, even when only a small amount of labeled data is available. Finally, we apply our method to several benchmark tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving performance on both task-specific and cross-domain metrics. Overall, our work represents an important step towards developing more robust NLP systems that can effectively handle partial and diverse datasets.",

    "A new domain name system (DNS) has opened up, allowing users to access websites using numbers instead of words. However, this change could also make it easier for scammers and cybercriminals to deceive internet users.\n\nThe DNS is responsible for translating human-readable website addresses into numerical IP addresses that computers can understand. The new system, known as DNSSEC, adds an extra layer of security by digitally signing each record in the DNS database. This makes it more difficult for hackers to tamper with or alter records, which could help prevent phishing attacks and other forms of online fraud.\n\nHowever, some experts are concerned that the introduction of DNSSEC could also create new opportunities for scammers. For example, they could register fake versions of legitimate websites using similar domain names, such as \"paypal.com\" instead of \"www.paypal.com.\" These fake sites could then trick unsuspecting users into entering their login credentials or making payments.\n\nTo protect against these types of scams, internet users should be cautious when clicking on links or visiting websites, especially if they are unfamiliar with the site or its URL. They should also keep their antivirus software and firewalls updated, and use strong passwords and two-factor authentication whenever possible.",

    "The paper presents an information-theoretic derivation of min-cut based clustering. This approach is used to partition a set of data points into clusters, where each cluster represents a group of similar data points. The main objective of this method is to minimize the cut between the two groups with the smallest number of edges.\n\nThe authors first introduce the concept of mutual information and its relationship to the minimum cut problem. They then derive a lower bound on the mutual information that can be achieved by any clustering algorithm using the min-cut criterion. This result shows that the min-cut based clustering algorithm is optimal in terms of minimizing the cut between the two groups while preserving as much information as possible.\n\nThe authors also provide a proof of their theorem, which involves several key steps including the definition of mutual information, the use of graph theory to represent the data points and clusters, and the application of information-theoretic principles to derive the lower bound.\n\nOverall, this paper provides a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of min-cut based clustering algorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness in achieving optimal results.",

    "The convex Pfaff-Darboux theorem is a fundamental result in differential geometry that states that any smooth, closed curve with nonzero torsion can be embedded into three-dimensional space as an immersion. This theorem was first proven by Pierre Darboux in 1879, but it was later reproven using different methods by Louis H. Kauffman and Charles E. Nirenberg in 1960. In their proof, they used the theory of variational calculus to show that there exists a unique minimizer of a certain functional defined on curves with fixed endpoints and fixed length. They also showed that this minimizer satisfies the conditions necessary for an embedding into three-space. Their work has had important applications in many areas of mathematics and physics, including topology, dynamical systems, and fluid mechanics.",

    "Ordered exchange graphs (OEGs) are a novel type of graph data structure that is designed to model complex systems with multiple types of interactions between nodes. In contrast to traditional undirected and directed graphs, OEGs allow for the representation of ordered exchanges or transactions between nodes, which can capture important information about the system's behavior.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the concept of OEGs and provide a comprehensive overview of their properties and applications. We show how OEGs can be used to model various real-world phenomena such as financial markets, social networks, and biological pathways. We also present algorithms for computing important metrics on OEGs, including centrality measures, community detection, and clustering.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through several case studies, including the analysis of stock market data and gene expression datasets. Our results highlight the potential of OEGs as a powerful tool for understanding complex systems and making predictions about their future behavior. Overall, this work represents an important step towards the development of more sophisticated graph models that can better capture the nuances of real-world interactions.",
    "The Bayesian dense inverse search (BDIS) algorithm is a novel approach to real-time stereo matching that has been developed specifically for use in minimally invasive surgery. This algorithm uses Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of an object being located at a particular position within a 3D space, based on its observed features and the prior knowledge about the location of similar objects.\nThe BDIS algorithm works by first identifying candidate locations for each feature point in the image sequence using a fast and efficient method such as SIFT or ORB. It then calculates the likelihood of each candidate location given the observed features and the prior knowledge about the location of similar objects. Finally, it selects the most likely location for each feature point and uses this information to generate a 3D reconstruction of the surgical site.\nOne of the key advantages of the BDIS algorithm is its ability to handle noisy and occluded data, which is common in medical imaging. Additionally, the algorithm can be easily integrated into existing surgical workflows, making it a valuable tool for minimally invasive procedures where precise spatial tracking is critical.\nOverall, the BDIS algorithm represents a significant advancement in the field of real-time stereo matching, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we perform minimally invasive surgery.",

Our approach enhances the reliability of CNN predictions by ensuring they are well-calibrated and detecting when the input images belong to an unseen distribution. Experimental results on two medical imaging datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both calibration and out-of-distribution detection compared to baseline methods. Overall, our proposed technique can enhance the performance and trustworthiness of CNN models used for medical image segmentation tasks.",

    "Council tax, which funds local government services in England and Wales, is set to be a key issue in this year's general election. The two main parties have outlined their proposals on how they plan to reform or change the system.\n\nThe Conservative Party has proposed replacing council tax with a new local property tax that would see homeowners pay based on the value of their home rather than its banding. This move aims to address what the party describes as an unfair system where people living in properties valued at lower levels end up paying less compared to those who live in higher-valued homes. However, critics argue that such changes could lead to increased bills for some households.\n\nOn the other hand, Labour has pledged to freeze council tax for five years if it wins power next month. It argues that working families are being hit hard by rising costs including council tax, energy prices, and transport fares, hence the need for intervention. Additionally, Shadow Communities Secretary Andrew Gwynne said his party will also look into introducing a landvalue taxation model similar to that used in Scotland.\n\nWhile both major political groups acknowledge there is room for improvement in current arrangements, experts say any significant reforms may take time due to complexities involved in changing longstanding systems.",

    "LONDON - Low-cost carriers have been dealt another blow as they face increased competition from rival airline companies, this time in the form of ferry services across the English Channel. The rise of budget ferries has led to a decline in demand for the Eurotunnel service, which had previously been a popular option for low-cost airlines looking to save on fuel costs.\n\nEurotunnel, which operates the Chunnel rail link between England and France, saw a significant drop in revenue last year due to the growing popularity of budget ferries. Analysts predict that unless Eurotunnel can find ways to compete with these lower prices, it could go bankrupt within the next few years.\n\nThe shift towards cheaper ferry options is being driven by new entrants into the market such as Brittany Ferries and DFDS Seaways, who are offering competitive rates to attract customers away from trains and planes. In addition, some airports in Europe have implemented higher fees and taxes on flights, making flying less attractive compared to taking a boat.\n\nDespite efforts to modernize its infrastructure and offer more amenities to passengers, Eurotunnel faces an uphill battle against the lure of cheapferry tickets. Some industry experts believe that if Eurotunnel cannot adapt quickly, it may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection or sell off its assets to pay off debts.\n\nHowever, there remains hope for the company yet. With Brexit looming large on the horizon, many expect cross-Channel travel to increase significantly over the coming months and years. If Eurotunnel can position itself strategically to take advantage of this uptick in traffic, it may still be able to turn things around before it's too late.",

    "The United States has reported its largest monthly trade deficit in nearly seven years, as imports surged to record levels while exports stagnated. The widening gap between what America buys and sells abroad is being driven by strong domestic demand for goods such as cars and electronics, which are largely supplied by other countries.\n\nAccording to figures released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, the US trade deficit increased 16% from August 2018 to $59 billion last month. Imports rose 1.% to $261 million, with automobiles accounting for much of that increase. Exports remained flat at $211billion, held back by weaker global growth and ongoing trade tensions.\n\nEconomists have warned that this trend could harm long-term economic prospects if left unchecked, particularly given rising concerns over debt levels and slowing global growth. However, President Donald Trump's administration has sought to address these issues through aggressive tariff policies aimed at reducing foreign imports and boosting American manufacturing.\n\nWhile some industries have benefited from these measures, others - including farmers and manufacturers who rely heavily on imported components –have been hit hard by retaliatory tariffs imposed by trading partners like China and Mexico.

    "Former Australia great David Campese has launched an astonishing attack on England, branding their players as 'whingeing' and accusing them of lacking respect for referees after they were penalised heavily in Saturday's Six Nations defeat to Ireland.\n\nThe English team was reduced to 14 men early in the second half when lock Joe Launchbury was sent off following a high tackle on Rob Kearney, with referee Romain Poite also awarding two penalties tries during Ireland's 32-20 victory at Twickenham.\n\nSpeaking to Australian media outlet Wide World of Sports, Campese claimed that such incidents highlighted what he saw as an ingrained problem within the English game.\n\n\"They're always complaining about everything,\" said Campese. \"It seems like every time I watch [England], there are complaints going up against decisions made by officials.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think it comes from lack of discipline - if you don't have self control or can't keep your emotions under wraps then things will happen out on the field.\"\n\nDespite his criticism, however, Campese stopped short of suggesting that England should be excluded from this year's Rugby World Cup, which is being held in Japan later this year.\n\nInstead, he called upon coach Eddie Jones to address the issue ahead of future fixtures, including next weekend's clash with Scotland.\n\n\"Eddie needs to get hold of these guys quickly because we know how important pride is to Scottish rugby so hopefully those issues won't arise again but who knows?\" he concluded.",

    "David Miliband, the younger brother of former UK Prime Minister Gordon Miliband, has had a distinguished career in politics and is currently serving as the President of the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Born in Brussels to Jewish parents who fled Nazi-occupied Europe, Miliband was raised in London and educated at Oxford University. He entered parliament in 2001 representing South Shields, and served as a minister under Tony Blair's government before becoming the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under his brother's leadership.\n\nMiliband played a key role in negotiating with US officials over the Iraq War and later criticized the invasion, which led to strained relations between him and then-President George W. Bush. After Labour lost the 2010 general election, he resigned from Parliament and became the head of the International Rescue Committee, an NGO that provides aid and assistance to refugees and displaced people around the world.\n\nUnder Miliband's leadership, the IRC has expanded its operations and now works in over 25 countries, providing emergency relief, rehabilitation, and long-term development support to millions of people affected by conflict and displacement. In addition to his work with the IRC, Miliband has been involved in various international initiatives aimed at promoting human rights and resolving global conflicts. His expertise on refugee issues has made him a sought-after commentator on global affairs, and he frequently contributes articles and op-eds to major newspapers and magazines.\n\nDespite speculation about his potential return to British politics, Miliband has stated that he intends to continue his work with the IRC and use his platform to advocate for vulnerable populations worldwide. With his deep understanding of international relations and experience working on some of the most pressing issues facing our world today, many observers believe that Miliband could play a significant role in shaping global policy in the years ahead.",

    "Gordon Brown has announced that he will present his annual budget on Wednesday, 16th March 2011. The Chancellor made the announcement in Parliament today as part of his autumn statement outlining government spending plans for the next two years.\n\nThe decision to set a specific date for this year's budget comes after months of speculation about when exactly it would be presented. Some had speculated that Mr Brown might delay the budget until after the local elections in May, but he appears to have opted instead for an earlier timetable.\n\nIn making the announcement, Mr Brown said that he wanted to give businesses and households as much notice as possible about any changes to taxation or public spending that may be contained within the budget. He also stressed the importance of maintaining fiscal discipline at a time when Britain is still grappling with high levels of debt and inflationary pressures.\n\nWhile details of what specifically will be included in this year's budget remain under wraps, sources close to the chancellor suggest that there could be significant announcements related to tax cuts and infrastructure investment aimed at stimulating economic growth. However, given the current state of the nation's finances, it remains unclear how much leeway Mr Brown will have to implement such measures.\n\nOverall, analysts are expecting this year's budget to be one of the most closely watched in recent memory, particularly given the ongoing debate over Britain's long-term economic strategy and the role that government policy should play in shaping it. With just three weeks to go before the big day, all eyes now turn to Westminster and the chancellor's office, eager to see what proposals Mr Brown has in store for Britain's taxpayers and economy alike.",
    "American insurance brokerage firm Marsh & McLennan Companies has announced plans to cut around 2,500 jobs worldwide as part of its efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs. The job cuts will affect employees across various levels and functions in the company.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, Marsh said that the restructuring plan is aimed at improving efficiency and enhancing profitability.

However, sources close to the matter told Reuters that up to 1,000 positions could be eliminated in the United States alone.\n\nThe company also stated that it expects annual pretax charges of approximately $250 million related to the restructuring program, mostly consisting of severance payments and other employee termination benefits.",
