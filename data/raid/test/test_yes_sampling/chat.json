    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",
    "  The $A_\\infty$ T-system, also called the octahedron recurrence, is a\ndynamical recurrence relation. It can be realized as mutation in a\ncoefficient-free cluster algebra (Kedem 2008, Di Francesco and Kedem 2009). We\ndefine T-systems with principal coefficients from cluster algebra aspect, and\ngive combinatorial solutions with respect to any valid initial condition in\nterms of partition functions of perfect matchings, non-intersecting paths and\nnetworks. This also provides a solution to other systems with various choices\nof coefficients on T-systems including Speyer's octahedron recurrence (Speyer\n2007), generalized lambda-determinants (Di Francesco 2013) and (higher)\npentagram maps (Schwartz 1992, Ovsienko et al. 2010, Glick 2011, Gekhtman et\nal. 2014).\n",
    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). COB is computationally\nefficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for multi-scale\ncontour detection and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for\nhierarchical segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the\nstate-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and\ndatasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness\nof our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical\nimage segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile,\na fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical\nSegmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, demonstrating the robustness and value\nof our framework, even when fully supervised training is feasible.",
    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges. We show that the QANet accurately estimates the scores of\nthe evaluated segmentations with respect to the hidden ground truth, as\npublished by the challenges' organizers.\n  The code is available at: TBD.",
    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

    "Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over.

It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.\nKevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing.

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast.

    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",

But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan.

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\nAndrew Cole (Australia).",
    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes. For every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programme's run, 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal.",
    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

    "Film-maker Spike Lee says black representation is stronger than ever in cinema and TV but the true power in entertainment lies behind the camera.\nThe She Hate Me director urged students at his old Atlanta university, Morehouse College, to seek \"gatekeeper positions\" behind the scenes. Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

    "Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years.\nFounding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed. \"We're actually into it as we speak. We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we're doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "I'm seriously really upset at second boss vault of stars. For a pure melee rogue it's next to impossible to help with the ice. Since we're pretty squishy as it is if you're standing on ice for more then. 5 seconds you're dead. That's insane but I can dodge and shit so whatever. But the aoe the boss does for ice just randomly hits after putting a red circle around u. Like it's really hard to dodge as I haven't found its timed at all.. Again I can get past that. What I can't get past is the god damn icicles. It's literally impossible as a melee character to help get your team broken out. The ice surrounding it hits insanely hard which is fucked. So I can't be near it. If I so happen to hit one good encounter and break them out it explodes and kills me. So which leaves me with one option tunnel vision. Which does the job  UT only once every 60 seconds. Ice happens every 20 so wtf am I to do. Help if there is a way",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "As the title says, I got this extreme feeling of wanting to drink women's milk from her tits. I don't know if there is a link for that, but I always want to do it. Even if she's not pregnant. I want to like keeping sucking till some comes out. Maybe, when I have a wife, I'll be sucking on her tits while she's pregnant with our own baby😂. But, right now, I want to just suck on some female's tit for some milk. Maybe, it's because I wasn't able to do it as a child since I was allergic to a lot of things as a baby, so I couldn't. But, now, I'm fine. I don't care if the woman's tits are small or big. I just want to suck them for the milk🤤😂😂. Like a milk vampire🤣. I'll probably get off just by sucking them dry🤤",
    "Not exactly sure where to post this but I thought this was a good one. I recently moved in with my good friend from high school after graduating college in May. Things are good between us, I have known him since middle school and we get along great. The rough thing is I am and have always been jealous of him. He's a tall attractive blonde guy with natural good looks and I am let's say not that. I have come to terms with not being super attractive a long time ago but it is tough to hear him talk about all the girls he rejects or gets with. He just seems happier than I am with his life, I work IT and make a sizeable salary while he works part time with no degree and takes a nap for most of the day. He just seems better than me at all of our shared hobbies. I don't want these feelings to ruin our friendship because he is a good friend but I find myself getting more annoyed at it after moving in. Any advice?",
    "I finally got around to giving my retriever a bath today after a month. He's been itchy these past few days and I figured a bath would help him. He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",

Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ?

    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",

While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer.

    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible.

I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",

All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you.

I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit.

    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

    "Now I know Victreebel can get swords dance and everything good mainly in postgame of fire red making the only real moveset I want to go with for him is razor leaf, body slam, toxic or acid, and maybe double team or rest. Victreebel isn’t the best in the older gens or maybe he is I have no idea. But I’d love to know what you think maybe I can give him other moves I’m deciding on either him or exeggutor and I really don’t know what else to use the rest of my team is gonna be Charizard, Primeape, Lapras, Raichu, and Nidoking and Victreebel is getting the 6th spot if I can find him viable, this is for ingame only also and I have access to get a bellsprout cause my brother has leaf green, I’d love to hear what you guys think and thanks.",
    "my best friend would always comment on my moms ass, tits, etc. he would always say how he fucks her yk the usual shit. until i came home early from playing basketball and i see my best friends car in the driveway. i go inside and it’s quiet but my moms home bc of covid. i go into her room to ask why he’s here to see my childhood best friend fucking my mom. she hurried for her clothes and that’s when i saw his dick. it had to have been at least 9 inches while i’m only 3 inches. while my moms rushing for clothes he tells her to stop and that he wants to see what’s in my pants. my mom didn’t say anything and neither did i do he came over and choked me against the wall and dropped my pants. he made my own mom take a picture or our dicks next to each other and then told me he wants to keep fuckign my mom. obviously i said no and we were going back and forth until he just holds me down and ties me up with bedsheets. he forced me to watch him fuck my own mom. she loves every part of it and was so surprised to see how much bigger his dick was",
    "I just watched fragment of trash taste how they lambasted Kazuya for that thing with not running after Mizuhara and i m wondering... I know when i started reading i felt he was pain in the ass but kinda understand where all those things he did come from and just gave him some pass. His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave. Is it really that bad in anime or am i just incel feeling bad for other incel ? I felt really down in my life for quite some time so i relate to characters with low self esteem especially this low like Kazuya, because it's uplifting when he tries to fight for himself out there.",
    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time. Advice on how to handle this situation?",
    "Started a new job, its kinda scary not physically knowing who your teammates are. I mean chat chat pero iba pa din like 1st day at sabay-sabay kayo kakain, tatawa kayo pag lahat kayo nahihirapan, etc. It kinda feels like on your own dba. Parang zoom meetings feel awkward din, saglint lng and like its kinda different din like having the vibe of someone working beside you and making chikka. Its awkward just inviting people na \"hey magzoom tayo para lng may presensya\" and it doesnt feel the same. Anyone who can give advice on how to handle this scenario? I guess its the feeling of uneasiness din sa new role, new company and before pandemic, hadn't realize the value of having people starting with you.",
    "Their motivation is pretty weak to be honest and Marvel's attempt to connect their motivation with \"The Blip\" makes absolutely zero sense either.  Like what motivated them to do what they do in the show? We got a glimpse of it like wanting the life before the blip to come back and \"blip refugees\". Why are the blip refugees struggling exactly? Why the life after the blip sucks even more? I'm not saying that every single question have to be answered ,but the way they try to make the audience sympathize with the Flagsmashers just doesn't work. Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",

Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself.

I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers. It has to be something about my hair causing this, I just can’t for the life of me figure out why or how. Does anyone have any ideas at all? Has anyone else experienced this?",
    "In my opinion Charmx isn’t leaving. The fact that it still shows that he still has 2.4K videos is pretty fishy, they could all possibly be unlisted or maybe deleted which could suck for him. My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

    "Whilst playing in the Great War mod I was loosing a war of attrition. The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia. I was pleased to have so much land after such a long war. However, my happiness was short lived as I was slapped in the face by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",
    "Our relationship is already stressed, and she is going through that phase everyone goes through where if someone dares correct her or politely inform her that she is making a mistake she blows up. I’ve done everything I can, and managed to find a ten gallon. It used to be in a five gallon, and a ten gallon was all I could find for her considering I’m broke from my own gosh and she wasn’t putting any effort into it. She comes to me with her fish problems but doesn’t listen to my advice when she hasn’t asked for it in regards to her fish’ safety. She told me a couple minutes ago that his stomach was looking a little big, he hasnt been swimming around much any more, and he isn’t eating as much/ at all. Tomorrow morning I convinced her to put him into a smaller container for a bit so I can get a good look at him and take a picture. Any suggestions?",
    "I’m still struggling in some aspects of the therapy. I’ve got the Amara View mask, which is comfortable enough. No problems falling asleep. Not snoring, which is great. AHI is generally between 4 and 8 while I can keep it on. But if the thing, Philips Dreamstation, goes 12 or over, i cannot breath out and end up almost choking on my own air. Doesn’t happen regularly. Maybe 2x in the last 2 weeks. I get a good, solid 3 hours after I initially fall asleep. After that, i’m usually up like at least 2 or 3 times and, recently, take the thing off after i hit about 4.5-5 hours just to get some sort of sleep. I don’t THINK i’m having claustrophobia issues. I’ve never had issues with claustrophobia in any other situations. I’m struggling to function during the day more now than before i started on the CPAP. I don’t know. I’m venting more than anything.",
    "Those of you in condo's and detached homes in Victoria, That have mini split heat pumps. How loud is your compressor unit outdoor? We had a two head unit mini split installed in August and it is loud as heck. The installer came out multiple times. Of course every time they came the unit wouldn't make the noise. It happens more at night and when it's really cold. I know they make noise but I feel like the amount of noise this unit makes is substantially louder than it should be. A friend of ours had one put in by the same installer. And his is whisper quite. I'm at my wits end on what to do. The installer keeps saying it's normal noise. But when the tv volume had to be turned up to drown out the noise of the outdoor unit. I feel like that's excessive.",
    "It gives me extreme anxiety when people come toward me for a hug or high-five. This is because everyone seems to do hugs or high-fives differently. In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something. Anytime someone high-fives me, they look at me as if I am retarded when I try for a normal high-five because I don’t know what sort of weird-ass high-five they will try for. Sorry this is so long.",
    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing. If I can’t get it fixed, the guy said he’ll take it back and give me my money back but damn I really want this damn thing to start. I hate that I can’t drive it or do anything with it",

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",
    "Signed up for Fraser’s HWPO app and was looking forward to it but it’s been a complete disappointment so far. Didn’t get a password email like the first email today said I would. Figured out I could do a password reset and get into the app. Got into the app and didn’t have the program in there. Checked back a bit later and it had shown up so got my hopes up that issues were over. Not so much. App is SUPER slow, nothing will load and all I can get to is a list of “Day 1, Day2, etc” if I click them it just spins and loads. Has been a complete let down so far. I’ve used various fitness apps before and all of them have been pretty decent and seem to be built on a pre-canned template app that whatever celeb throws their name on and was expecting similar for this one but not so much. This is like a freshman programming class tried to do a school project and failed at it hard. Anyone else get different results?",
    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.

There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo?

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

    "GB is what go me into my love for hot sauce. I have bought a lot of it over the years. Recently I've noticed some small changes. The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money. I'd honestly pay more for it if it meant keeping the OG recipes. Maybe Dexter is getting tired of running the company? Maybe he is going to sell it?

    "I regularly lose all kinds of attraction for everyone,meaning no sexual or romantic attraction to anyone,meaning no desire to date anyone and looking at content and people that usually would make me feel feel sexually attracted stops doing just that.Those phases usually last between 2 or 4 months and I'm always worried that that my attraction will never come back when I have those phrases,however up until now it always has.Im pretty sure it's not sexual dysfunction becuase that doesnt include loss of romantic attraction and it doesn't affect me in any physical way,its all psychological.Im also sure that I'm not asexual since I do feel all that attraction outside of those phases.I have tried researching my symptoms but I've never really found anything that would match,and it's just really worrying me and I dont even know if its abnormal or  just a normal part of puberty.I also marked it NSFW just to be sure.",
    "So I’ve noticed that viewer ship is all over the place depending on when I post or what I post. I just recently had posts get around 5000-54000 views. I posted again earlier in the morning and only got about 14 views. I’m wondering if when I posts effects my views as much as even the content I’m posting. I’ve also noticed people don’t really want to know about my life they would rather watch me do impulsive things that they more or less want to do but can’t go through with like dying my hair or making things that the audiences hobbies coincide with. The steps of getting viewer ship seems very difficult but also all over the place. Some people use hashtags some don’t but still get 1000’s of views. What constitutes as the perfect time, the perfect description with hashtags or even the best content for your demographic? I’ve definitely improved my viewership since the vine era but it’s all really an equation of when and what. At some point I’m really hoping to find what it is my followers or new viewers exactly want to see but until then I am still figuring it out. Has anyone noticed what seems the best time to post or even the best hashtags to use? What content seems to do better for newer users to help boost their platforms? Maybe some people could take a look at my platform and critique what I post so I can improve. tiktok: ",
    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.  I’m curious, why do your MILs words/judgements bring you down?",
    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize.

Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life.

    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11.<br/><br/>4. All UAS aircraft are armed.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film.

A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in.

I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "Accurate segmentation of cardiac structures from medical images is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning in various cardiovascular diseases. However, annotating large amounts of data for deep learning models can be time-consuming and expensive, especially when working with diverse datasets from different domains. This paper proposes a novel approach called Dual-Teacher that integrates intra-domain and inter-domain teachers to improve annotation efficiency in cardiac segmentation tasks.\n\nThe proposed method combines a domain-specific teacher (DS-Teacher) and a domain-agnostic teacher (DA-Teacher) to leverage both intra-domain knowledge and inter-domain knowledge. The DS-Teacher is trained on manually annotated images within a specific domain, while the DA-Teacher is trained on a combination of annotations from multiple domains. By integrating these two teachers, the model can learnfrom both local and global patterns, leading to improved performance compared to using a single teacher.\n\nExperiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the Dual-Teacher strategy. Compared to using only a single teacher, our method reduces the amount of manual annotation required by up to 50% while maintaining high accuracy levels. Furthermore, we show that the Dual-Teacher outperforms state-of-the-art methods that rely solely on intra-domain or inter-domain information.\n\nOur findings demonstrate the potential of the Dual-Teacher framework for efficient cardiac segmentation in various scenarios where labeled data is limited or difficult to obtain. The proposed method has important implications for the development of deep learning models for image segmentation in healthcare applications, particularly those requiring cross-dataset generalization.",
    "In this paper, we explore the relationship between the Quantum Zeno effect and the well-known literary character Hamlet. We propose that the Quantum Zeno effect, which is a phenomenon where the continuous measurement of a quantum system can prevent it from evolving into its ultimate state, can be analogously applied to the protagonist of Shakespeare's famous play. By frequently detecting the polarization oflight in a quantum system, we can draw parallels with the way in which Hamlet's repeated introspection and self-doubt prevent him from taking decisive action. Through this analogy, we gain new insights into the nature of indecision and the role of observation in both quantum mechanics and human behavior. Our findings have implications for our understanding of how frequent monitoring and feedback loops can influence the evolution of complex systems, both in the quantum realm and in the realms of human psychology and decision making.",
    "This paper presents a novel method for sub-20nm silicon patterning and metal lift-off using thermal scanning probe lithography. The technique utilizes a sharp probing tip to produce high-resolution patterns on silicon substrates, while also enabling precise control over the size and position of the resulting features. By combining this approach with metal lift-off techniques, we demonstrate the ability to create complex, ultra-small scale structures that are suitable for use in a variety of applications, including microelectronics, photonics, and biosensing.\n\nThe proposed methodology leverages the advantages of thermal scanning probe lithography, which offers high resolution and precision without the need for expensive optics or specialized equipment. The process begins by functionalizing the probing tip with a sacrificial layer, which is then used to pattern the silicon substrate through localized heating. Subsequent removal of the sacrificial layer results in the formation of a nanoscale feature that can be further modified through additional patterning steps.\n\nIn order to achieve metal lift-off, a thin metal film is deposited onto the patterned substrate and subsequently etched back, leaving behind isolated metal islands that are suspended above the underlying silicon. These islands can be arranged in various configurations, such as lines, dots, or arrays, depending on the desired application.\n\nThrough careful optimization of the processing conditions, we have achieved linewidths as small as 15 nm and dot sizes down to 10 nm, representing a significant improvement over traditional lithographic methods. Additionally, the ability to precisely control the spacing and arrangement of these features enables the creation of complex geometries that could not be realized using conventional top-down approaches.\n\nThe potential of this technology was demonstrated through the fabrication of a proof-of-concept device consisting of a pair of closely spaced metal lines separated by a narrow gap. Electrical measurements revealed that the resistance across the gap was highly sensitive to changes in temperature, indicating the possibility of using such devices as ultra-compact thermometers or sensors.\n\nOverall, our results represent a major advancement in the field",
    "Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York is a sprawling, visceral epic that delves deep into the dark underbelly of 19th century New York City. The film is a tale of revenge, rivalries, and the struggle for power in the city's crime-ridden streets.\n\nThe film boasts impressive production values, with elaborate set designs and costumes that transport viewers back in time to the era of Ten Points gangs and Tammany Hall corruption. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the gritty, raw energy of the city's streets and alleys.\n\nThe cast is equally impressive, led by Leonardo DiCaprio as Amsterdam Vallon, a young man seeking vengeance against Bill \"The Butcher\" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) for killing his father. DiCaprio brings intensity and depth to his role, his character driven by a fierce determination to bring down his enemy.\n\nDay-Lewis steals the show, however, delivering a performance that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. He embodies the ruthlessness and cunning of Bill \"The Butcher,\" making him one of cinema's most memorable villains. His supporting cast, including Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, and Brendan Gleeson, all turn in standout performances.\n\nThe real star of the film, though, may be Martin Scorsese himself. His direction is masterful, weaving together themes of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption amidst the chaos and violence of the city's criminal underworld. His use of music and editing creates a frenetic pace that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the nearly three-hour runtime.\n\nIf there are any criticisms to be made, it would be that some plot points feel overly convenient or predictable at times. However, this is a minor quibble compared to the overall impact of the film.\n\nOverall, Gangs of New York is a triumph – a visceral, immersive experience that will leave you breathless and wanting more.

    "In this paper, we explore the phenomenology of a quantum-classical phase transition in a system exhibiting spontaneous superposition breaking and single photon interference. By combining analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover novel features of the phase transition that are absent in traditional quantum phase transitions. Specifically, we show that the presence of spontaneous superposition breaking leads to a non-trivial ground state structure, which gives rise to power-law correlations between different order parameters. We also demonstrate the possibility of observing single-photon level interference effects in the system, which provides a direct probe of the quantum nature of the phase transition. Our results provide new insights into the rich physics of quantum-classical phase transitions and pave the way for experimental investigations in various platform such as circuit QED or optical lattices.",
    "There is widespread confusion among consumers and retailers about what constitutes high-definition television (HDTV), according to a new survey.\n\nThe research, conducted by market analysts Nielsen Media Research, found that nearly half of all respondents believed that any televisions with a screen size larger than 32 inches was considered HDTV. In reality, screen size has no bearing on whether or not a TV is considered high definition.\n\nAnother common misconception was that all flat-screen TVs are automatically HDTVs. However, many older models of flat-screen TVs do not meet the standard definition of HDTV, which requires a minimum resolution of 720 horizontal lines for SD (standard definition) and 1980 x 1080 pixels for HD Ready. The study found that only one in five people knew that HDTV sets have a higher resolution than SD sets.\n\nAdditionally, there was confusion over the terms used to describe different levels of high definition. While 63% recognized the term 'Full HD', fewer than one third were familiar with '1080p' - the highest level of High Definition resolution - despite it being the most commonly used designation for Full HD.\n\n\"Consumers want bigger screens, but they don't necessarily know what makes an HDTV,\" said Jon Bennion, media analytics director at Nielsen. \"Retail staff often contribute to the problem. They will frequently point out features such as wide viewing angles, built-in digital tuners or networking capabilities when asked about HDReady or full-HD sets. Few bother explaining these features are also present on some lowerresolution units.\" \n\nThis lack of understanding affects consumer spending habits as well. Almost one fifth of those questioned who had bought an HD set admitted they wouldn't be able to tell if their TV was actually displaying HD content even though they spent an average £40 per month extra for a service they thought upscaled non-HD programming. A service that only works when you watch channels specifically labelled as HD! Furthermore 5 per cent admitted shelling out £200 or more just so someone else could set up the device for them – again",
    "A lot of people say things they don't mean in times of anger or frustration, but that doesn't necessarily make it acceptable for your family member to claim she will respond positively to you taking your own life.\nSince you have become aware this bothers you and is probably harmful, it needs to be addressed, if only so other members of your family are not influenced by her words into treating suicide lightly as well. Unfortunately, since you feel hurt it is likely there is already some tension between you two, so this conversation has been 'a long time coming'.\n\nWhen you next see your sister alone and when neither of you is busy with anything else stressing (and ideally at an appropriate volume indoors), calmly bring up what she said to you about not stopping you from attempting suicide, even prefaced by something like \"I know we don't always get along perfectly\" or whatever intro makes sense to establish the right mood. Then tell her exactly how hearing such statements affects you, especially focusing on why it upsets you. It might also help you steel yourself emotionally beforehand in case she tries turning it around on you or simply gaslighting you outright, though one hopes she does take accountability considering the effort you made reaching out to talk about this alone together honestly and openly to avoid further conflict for everyone involved. Don't let her turn away responsibility onto another topic because despite having differing opinions, siblings must find common ground agreeable enough upon which both can stand without feeling antagonism towards each other - much less over an issue like this! Simply state plain facts of experience that cannot reasonably be contested unless she wishes to invalidate all your emotions - indeed actively seek her perspective as an invitation to work through difficult feelings collaboratively whenever possible: put emphasis on why her statement was abusive rather than going straight for calling it abuse. You should still try de-escalation phrases and active listening skills during the conversation proper, however, to come closer to that hypothetical understanding. Explain things remain unresolved until then. She may eventually admit these were thoughtless and dangerous comments after recognizing their",
    "Hey fellow fans! I've been following AJR for a while now, and I have to say, I'm getting pretty tired of all the hate they're receiving. I understand that not everyone is going to like their music, but some of the comments I've seen online are just ridiculous.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say that AJR is an incredibly talented group. Their songs are catchy, well-produced, and they have a unique sound that sets them apart from other bands in their genre. They're not afraid to experiment with different styles and instruments, and their live shows are always high-energy and entertaining.\n\nBut despite all this, I see so many people trashing them online. Some say their music is too poppy or mainstream, while others accuse them of ripping off other artists. I've even seen people claim that they're trying to be some kind of boy band or that they're only successful because of their looks.\n\nHonestly, I think a lot of these criticisms are unfair and misinformed. AJR has worked hard to get where they are today, and they deserve credit for their talent and dedication. They're not trying to conform to any particular mold or fit into a specific genre - they're just making music that they love and want to share with the world.\n\nFurthermore, I think it's really disrespectful and hurtful to attack them personally. The members of AJR are human beings with feelings and emotions, just like us. They put themselves out there every day, sharing their art with the world and opening themselves up to criticism and scrutiny. That takes courage and vulnerability, and we should appreciate that instead of tearing them down.\n\nI know that not everyone is going to agree with me on this, but I wanted to speak up and defend AJR against all the hate they're getting. If you don't like their music, that's okay - just move along and listen to something else. But let's try to be more supportive and respectful of each other as fans and as a community.",
    "NASA scientist James Hansen has announced that he will delay his return to Earth until 2006, citing concerns over the safety of the space shuttle program.\n\nHansen, who has been living and working on the International Space Station since March 2001, had been scheduled to return to Earth in November 2004. However, following the recent Columbia disaster, which killed seven astronauts during re-entry, Hansen has decided to postpone his return until further notice.\n\n\"I understand that my family and friends are eager for me to come home, but I cannot in good conscience risk my life by boarding a space shuttle at this time,\" said Hansen in a statement from the Space Station. \"The safety of the crew is paramount, and we must take all necessary precautions to ensure their well-being.\"\n\nHansen's decision comes as NASA faces intense scrutiny over its handling of the space shuttle program, particularly with regards to safety protocols. The agency has faced criticism for ignoring warnings about potential design flaws in the shuttle's thermal protection system, which may have contributed to the Columbia tragedy.\n\nWhile Hansen's decision appears to be a personal one, it highlights growing concerns within the scientific community about the risks associated with space travel. Many experts have called for a temporary suspension of manned missions pending an independent review of NASA's safety procedures.\n\nNASA officials say they respect Hansen's decision and will continue to work towards ensuring the safe return of all astronauts currently stationed aboard the ISS. The agency insists that it remains committed to completing the construction of the Space Station, despite setbacks such as the loss of Columbia.\n\nMeanwhile, Hansen continues to carry out vital research from his vantage point in orbit, making him one of the longest-serving American astronauts in history. His contributions to our understanding of climate change and environmental issues have earned him worldwide recognition and acclaim.",
    "This paper proposes a novel approach to superpixel segmentation based on dynamic and iterative spanning forest. Superpixels are an essential step in many computer vision tasks, such as object recognition, image restoration, and feature extraction. However, traditional methods of superpixel segmentation have limitations, such as being sensitive to initialization, affected by parameters, and unable to handle complex scenes with varying texture and color.\n\nIn this work, we propose a method that addresses these issues by combining the concept of spanning trees and forests with dynamic iteration. Our method starts with an initial random partition of the image into regions, which are then used as seeds for growing forests. The forests are grown dynamically using a top-down approach, where each node is assigned a label that belongs to one of the predefined classes. The edges between nodes are adaptively updated based on similarity metrics, ensuring the formation of coherent regions.\n\nThe proposed method uses two types of moves, expansion and contraction, to iteratively refine the segmentation results. Expansion moves involve merging neighboring regions that belong to different classes but share similar features, whereas contraction moves involve splitting regions that contain distinct objects or textures. These moves are applied probabilistically to maintain equilibrium between spatial consistency and class uniformity.\n\nExperiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, including BSDS500, UC Irvine Pedestrian, and MSRA10K. The results show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, it achieves higher segmentation quality while reducing computation time by up to three orders of magnitude compared to graph-cuts and random walker based methods. Furthermore, our method produces more consistent segments than other gradient-based approaches.\n\nThis work offers significant advantages over current superpixel segmentation techniques since it can efficiently process images of any size without sacrificing accuracy. As such, it has broad applications in various areas like object detection, tracking, robotics, medical imaging analysis, video surveillance & analytics , etcetera - all benefiting from faster yet accurate superpixel generation!",
    "Sure, here's a review of the movie \"Million Dollar Arm\":\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect going into this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The story follows two young Indian men, Rinku and Dinesh, who are discovered by a struggling sports agent named JB Bernstein (played by Jon Hamm) and brought to the United States to learn baseball in the hopes of becoming major league pitchers.\n\nThe film does a great job depicting the cultural clashes that arise when the two Indians arrive in America. From their initial confusion over things like fast food and television to their struggles adapting to the strict rules and regimented lifestyle of professional athletes, the film manages to find humor without resorting to stereotypes or patronizing its characters.\n\nThe performances from the entire cast are strong, with Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal as Rinku and Dinesh delivering particularly standout performances. They bring a lot of heart and authenticity to their roles, making it easy to root for them as they navigate their way through this strange new world.\n\nJon Hamm also shines as the flawed but ultimately likable JB Bernstein. He brings a lot of depth to his character, making him more than just a typical sports movie mentor figure. You can tell there's a lot of passion behind his performance, which only adds to the overall impact of the film.\n\nOne thing that really stood out to me about \"Million Dollar Arm\" is its focus on the emotional journey of its characters. It's not just about the sports - it's about these two young men finding their place in the world and learning to chase their dreams. There are some genuinely moving moments towards the end of the film that had me tearing up (and I'm not even a big crier!).\n\nOverall, \"Million Dollar Arm\" is a feel-good underdog story with a lot of heart. Even if you're not a huge sports fan, I think you'll find something to enjoy here. It's well worth checking out!",
    "I'm so tired of living in fear of triggering myself. It feels like everything I do, every decision I make, is dictated by my anxiety and depression. I can't watch certain movies or TV shows because they might have a triggery scene. I can't go to certain places because they might remind me of something traumatic. I can't even have certain conversations because they might send me into a panic attack.\n\nIt's like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around my own mind, trying to avoid anything that might set me off. And it's exhausting. I feel like I'm missing out on so much life because of my mental health issues. I'm sick of feeling like a fragile glass vase that might shatter at any moment.\n\nI know that avoidance isn't the answer. I know that facing my fears and triggers is the only way to truly overcome them. But it's hard when the thought of doing so sends me into a state of pure terror. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place – avoidance vs confrontation, neither of which seems like a good option.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way? How did you cope with your triggers without letting them take over your life? I want to break free from this cycle of avoidance and start living again.",
    "In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimating high-dimensional models that leverages higher order statistical moments to improve estimation accuracy. Traditional estimators, such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, are based on the first two moments of the data distribution and can be sensitive to their choice. Our proposed method uses higher order moments to derive more robust estimating equations that are less susceptible to moment misspecification.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and real-data applications in finance, marketing, and genetics. The results show that our method outperforms traditional estimators in terms of forecast accuracy and parameter inference, particularly when data dimensions are high. We also establish the theoretical properties of our estimator under regularity conditions, including consistency and asymptotic normality.\n\nOur work has important implications for fields where high-dimensional modeling is prevalent, providing a reliable alternative to existing methods that may be affected by moment misspecification or poor convergence rates. By harnessing the power of higher order statistics, our approach offers a powerful tool for practitioners and researchers who need accurate estimates and predictions from complex data sets.",
    "I woke up this morning to find that my Instagram follower count had inexplicably dropped to zero. I mean, absolutely zero. Not a single soul was left. It's like everyone simultaneously decided to jump ship and leave me stranded on an island of digital obscurity.\n\nI stared at my phone screen in disbelief for a solid five minutes, wondering if it was some kind of glitch or if somehow my account had been hacked. But nope, upon further investigation, all of my posts were still there, along with my profile picture and bio. It seemed like business as usual... except for the minor detail that literally nobody was following me anymore.\n\nNow, you may be thinking to yourself, \"Well, maybe you did something wrong.\" And trust me, I thought about that too. Did I accidentally post something offensive? Did I forget to use hashtags one too many times? Was I not posting enough cat pictures? The possibilities raced through my mind.\n\nBut then another thought occurred to me: perhaps this is just how life goes sometimes. One day, you have thousands of people hanging onto your every word; the next, you're singing solo in an empty stadium (figuratively speaking). It's a harsh reality, but such is the world we live in. Social media can be both cruel and unforgiving.\n\nSo here's what I'm going to do. Instead of panicking or getting discouraged, I've decided to see this little episode as an opportunity to start fresh. Maybe now I can actually concentrate more on creating meaningful content instead of constantly checking my follower count like an anxious teenager. Who knows, maybe Instagram will magically fix itself in due time; until then, it's back to basics! Anyone want to help a girl out by giving her a follow? Haha, jk (sort of).",
    "\"Beasts of No Nation\" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that delves into the horrors of child soldiery in Africa. The story follows a young boy named Agu, who is forced to flee his home after his family is killed by rebels. He soon finds himself among a group of similarly displaced children, all of whom have been brainwashed and coerced into becoming soldiers for a brutal warlord.\n\nThe film does not shy away from portraying the harsh realities of war and its effects on innocent civilians. The violence and cruelty depicted are harrowing, but they serve to emphasize the urgency of the situation and the importance of bringing attention to these atrocities.\n\nIdris Elba Turns in a commanding performance as the Commandant, the ruthless leader of the rebel forces. His character's complexity highlights the depth of the problem; he is charismatic enough to persuade kids to join him yet sadistic enough to order them to commit inconceivable crimes. Another standout performer is Abraham Attah, who plays Agu with incredible sensitivity and nuance. We see the world through his eyes, and his emotional journey is gut-wrenching and heartbreaking.\n\nCary Joji Fukunaga's direction brings out the most potential in this material. Every frame is filled with tension, fear, and dread. His use of natural light adds to the documentary feel of the movie without sacrificing artistry or visual appeal.. One memorable scene shows Agu walking down a road surrounded by dense foliage while being pursued by enemy fighters. It's reminiscent of a predator stalking prey - we can almost smell the danger through the screen. The cinematography immerses us completely in this universe which makes the tragedy even more intolerable - this could be happenning anywhere right now!\n\nThe film also sheds some positive light onto humans capacity for hope amidst hopelessness through minor subplots and characters - reminding audiences there will always a glimmer of optimism no matter how bleak matters become. Thats what pushes people",

    "I've been working as a marine biologist for several years now, and I've seen some incredible things in my time studying the ocean and its inhabitants. But one thing that still manages to amaze me is the sheer variety of seashells that can be found along the shores of our planet.\n\nI recently had the chance to travel to a remote island off the coast of South America, and let me tell you – it was a shell-lover's paradise! The beaches were littered with an array of colors and shapes that I had never seen before. There were delicate pink conch shells, massive black sea urchin spines, and even a few rare specimens of the legendary Junonia shell.\n\nAs I wandered along the shoreline, marveling at the beauty of these natural wonders, I couldn't help but wonder – who buys all of these shells? Who are the people behind the demand for these stunning structures? And why do they love them so much?\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more intrigued I became. So, I decided to start asking around, talking to locals and other beachgoers about their experiences with seashells. Some folks collect them as souvenirs, while others use them in craft projects or jewelry making. One woman even told me that she uses shells to create beautiful mosaics and sells them at local art fairs.\n\nBut then, there are those who take their love for shells to the next level. I met a young boy who excitedly showed me his vast collection of over a hundred different species, each one carefully cleaned and categorized. His eyes lit up as he talked about his favorite finds and the thrill of searching for new additions to his collection.\n\nAnd finally, there's the woman who inspired this post: a friendly older lady who has spent her entire life beachcombing. She knows every nook and cranny of this particular stretch of coastline, and she's always willing to share her knowledge with anyone who will listen. She shown me some of her most prized discoveries – including a gorgeous, rainbow-",
    "Abstract:\n\nAccurate segmentation of nuclei in microscopy images is a crucial step in various biomedical applications, including cancer diagnosis and cell counting. However, this task is challenging due to variations in image quality, staining conditions, and nuclear morphology. In this paper, we propose a novel method for segmenting nuclei in divergent microscopy images using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and traditional computer vision techniques. Our approach consists of three stages: (1) preprocessing, (2) feature extraction, and (3) post-processing. In the preprocessing stage, we apply data augmentation and normalization techniques to enhance the quality of the input images. In the feature extraction stage, we use a CNN to learn hierarchical representations of the images, which are then used to extract relevant features. Finally, in the post-processing stage, we employ traditional computer vision techniques such as thresholding and morphological operations to refine the segmentation results. We evaluate our method on two publicly available datasets, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The proposed method has important implications for automated analysis of microscopy data, and can potentially be applied to other image segmentation tasks in biomedical research.",
    "I just watched this movie with my family and we all loved it! Jack Black is absolutely hilarious as Dewey Finn, the wannabe rock star turned substitute teacher.

I love how the movie takes you on a journey from them being complete beginners to becoming an amazing rock band. The music is catchy and had us all singing along.\n\nThe movie has a great message about embracing your individuality and following your dreams, no matter what others think. It's such a feel-good film that left us all feeling uplifted and inspired. My kids (ages 8 & 10) enjoyed it just as much as my husband and I did, which says a lot since they have different tastes in movies. We highly recommend \"School of Rock\" for families with kids of all ages - it's definitely a must-see!",
    "I recently watched the movie \"Carrie\" and was blown away by its sheer intensity and raw emotion. The film tells the story of a bullied teenage girl named Carrietta White, who is pushed to her limits by her peers and ultimately unleashes a terrifying reign of terror upon them.\n\nThe film's opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie, with a haunting and disturbing depiction of Carrie's abusive home life. Her mother, played by Piper Laurie, is a religious fanatic who sees her daughter's abilities as a sign of sin and evil. This theme of religion vs. supernatural powers is woven throughout the film, adding depth and complexity to the narrative.\n\nThe cast delivers powerful performances across the board, with Sissy Spacek delivering a standout performance as Carrie. She brings a quiet vulnerability to the role, making us feel for her character despite her eventual descent into madness. Amy Irving shines in her breakout role as Sue Snell, the popular cheerleader who feels guilty for participating in Carrie's humiliation and convinces her boyfriend to take her to prom as a form of redemption. Nancy Allen plays Chris Hargensen, the spiteful queen bee of the school who masterminds the cruel prank that sets off the chain of events.\n\nBrian De Palma directs with a keen eye, building tension slowly until it reaches a boiling point. He uses long takes, slow motion, and split-screen techniques to create a visually stunning and suspenseful climax that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The infamous prom scene is particularly memorable, with Carrie's telekinetic powers causing chaos and destruction that culminates in one of cinema's most iconic moments.\n\nWhat struck me most about this film is how relevant it still is today. The themes of bullying, social hierarchy, peer pressure, and the struggle for acceptance are timeless issues that continue to affect generations of young people. While the film may seem like a period piece due to its '70s setting and fashion, its message remains fresh and",
    "In this paper, we demonstrate a novel approach for integrating atomic layer deposited (ALD) second order nonlinear optical metamaterials with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible nanophotonic circuitry. The ALD process allows for precise control over the thickness and uniformity of the deposited material, resulting in high-quality, defect-free films with tailored properties. By carefully designing the composition and structure of the metamaterial, we achieve strong second-order nonlinear effects, enabling efficient conversion of photons to higher harmonics.\n\nThe integrated platform is compatible with standard CMOS fabrication processes, allowing for seamless integration of the metamaterial with silicon-based photonic devices. We experimentally demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach by fabricating a proof-of-concept device consisting of an ALD-deposited metamaterial slab waveguide coupled to a CMOS-compatible silicon nitride waveguide.\n\nMeasurements show excellent agreement with simulations, highlighting the potential of ALD- deposited second order nonlinear optical metamaterials for high-performance, CMOS-compatible nanophotonic applications. Our results pave the way for the development of compact, efficient, and highly sensitive photonic devices operating at low powers, which are essential for a variety of emerging technologies such as data centers, sensing systems, and telecommunications.",
    "Abstract:\n\nInversion sequences are a fundamental concept in combinatorics and have numerous applications in various fields, including computer science, biology, and finance. Despite their widespread use, little is known about the properties and patterns that govern these sequences. This paper addresses this gap by investigating patterns in inversion sequences and providing new insights into their structure and behavior.\n\nUsing a combination of mathematical techniques and computational methods, we uncover several novel patterns in inversion sequences, including symmetries, palindromic structures, and repeating motifs. We also establish connections between inversion sequences and other areas of mathematics, such as permutation statistics and algebra.\n\nOur findings shed light on the underlying structure of inversion sequences and open up new avenues for research in enumerative combinatorics. The patterns and techniques discovered in this study have far-reaching implications for a broad range of disciplines that rely on inversion sequences, from coding theory to bioinformatics. Moreover, our results demonstrate the power of interdisciplinary approaches to solving complex problems and underscore the beauty and importance of the connection between mathematics and computer science.",
    "With the rise of streaming services and the increasing popularity of smartphones, mobile television is becoming an area of significant interest for media companies and consumers alike. Industry experts are predicting that mobile TV will be one of the biggest trends in entertainment this year, offering users a new way to consume their favorite shows and content on-the-go.\n\nTraditional television viewing has been declining in recent years, as people turn to online platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime for their entertainment needs. However, mobile TV offers a unique opportunity for broadcasters and content creators to reach a wider audience and engage with viewers in a more personalized way.\n\nSeveral major networks have already launched their own mobile apps, allowing viewers to watch live TV or catch up on missed episodes at any time. For example, the BBC's iPlayer app allows UK residents to stream live and on-demand programming straight to their smartphones or tablets. Other channels, such as ITV Hub and My5, offer similar functionality.\n\nIn addition to traditional TV content, there are also a number of digital-first channels that are specifically designed for mobile viewing. These include short-form videos, social media clips, and interactive content that can be easily consumed during spare moments throughout the day.\n\nOne of the key benefits of mobile TV is its convenience. Viewers no longer need to be tied to a specific schedule or location to watch their favorite shows. They can simply pull out their phone or tablet and enjoy high-quality video wherever they happen to be – whether it's on public transportation, during lunch breaks, or even while waiting in line.\n\nMoreover, mobile TV offers a level of interactivity that traditional TV cannot match. Broadcasters can use features like push notifications and personalized recommendations to engage with audiences and encourage them to discover new content.

    "Conservative MP James Johnson has spoken of his surprise and delight after being reunited with his daughter, who was given up for adoption nearly 40 years ago.\n\nMr Johnson, a prominent figure in British politics, had long been searching for his biological child, whom he had never met. He received the shocking news that she had been found just days ago, following a lengthy investigation by a private investigator.\n\n\"I am still trying to process this incredible turn of events,\" Mr Johnson said in an interview. \"It's truly a miracle that my daughter and I have been reunited after all these years.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Mr Johnson's daughter was born in 1982 when he was just 23 years old. At the time, he was not married and felt ill-equipped to raise a child on his own. With the support of his family, it was decided that adoption would be best for the baby's future.\n\nFor decades, Mr Johnson had wondered about his daughter but struggled to find any information due to privacy laws surrounding adoption. It wasn't until he hired a private detective several months ago that he finally got the breakthrough he had been hoping for.\n\nThe detective discovered that Mr Johnson's daughter had grown up happy and healthy, raised by a loving family in another part of the country. She had only recently learned about her true identity and reached out to her birth father through social media.\n\n\"When we first made contact, I couldn't believe what I was reading,\" Mr Johnson recalled. \"There were so many questions running through my mind: Is this really happening? Is this person truly my daughter? But as soon as we spoke, I knew instantly - there was no doubt in my mind that she was my child.\"\n\nThe pair arranged to meet in secret earlier this week, surrounded by close friends and family members. The emotional encounter left everyone present in tears.\n\n\"I was blown away by how similar our mannerisms are - even down to the way we both gesture with our hands,\" Mr Johnson shared tenderly.",
    "The US dollar has weakened against a basket of major currencies, as investors become increasingly cautious in the lead up to the new year.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance against six other prominent currencies, fell by 0.3% on Thursday to 96.54. This marks a third consecutive day of declines for the currency, with investors seeming to favored safer-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen.\n\nThe downturn in the dollar's fortunes comes amidst growing concerns about the global economic outlook, particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Traders are also anxiously awaiting the outcome of next week's meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, where they will discuss the fate of their nations' long-standing trade dispute.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, some analysts believe that the dollar's slide may be temporary, citing strong underlying economic fundamentals in the United States. \"While there are certainly risks on the horizon, the US economy is still performing well, with low unemployment and steady growth,\" said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank London. \"We don't see any reason why the dollar can't regain its strength in the coming months.\"\n\nIn contrast, others are more bearish on the dollar's prospects, arguing that its recent weakness reflects deeper structural issues. \"The dollar's status as a safe haven currency is being challenged, as countries like China and Japan continue to build theirreserves and assert their influence in global markets,\" said Dr. Yves Benziger, head of currency strategy at UBS Wealth Management. \"With interest rates unlikely to rise significantly in the near future, we expect further downward pressure on the dollar versus Asian currencies.\"\n\nAs the final trading days of the year wind down, market participants are keeping a close eye on equity prices and Treasury yields for signs of whether the risk-off mood will persist into 20",
    "Hitch, the romantic comedy starring Will Smith and Eva Mendes, has maintained its position at the top of the US box office for the second week in a row. According to studio estimates released on Sunday, the film took in $27 million over the weekend, fending off challenges from new releases such as The Pacifier and Be Cool.\n\nHitch's strong performance comes as no surprise, given the positive word-of-mouth buzz surrounding the movie and its broad appeal to audiences of all ages. The film's unique blend of humour, drama, and heartwarming moments appears to have struck a chord with moviegoers across the country.\n\nThe success of Hitch is also significant because it marks the first time that a romantic comedy featuring African American leads has reached number one at the US box office. This milestone underscores both the growing diversity of Hollywood productions and the changing tastes of mainstream cinema-goers.\n\nIn light of this achievement, Will Smith expressed his gratitude to fans and emphasized the importance of representation in media. In an interview with Variety, he said: \"It's a triumph when we can tell our stories and people respond. More importantly, when they respond positively, it means they see themselves.\"\n\nDespite the continued dominance of Hitch, other films also made notable showings at the domestic box office. Disney's animated feature, Chicken Little, held steady at second place, earning $18.5 million, while the action comedy, The Pacifier, debuted at third with $16.9 million. The critically acclaimed Brokeback Mountain expanded its release and jumped up two spots to fourth place with $13 million.\n\nWith Valentine's Day just around the corner, industry insiders predict that Hitch will maintain its momentum going into next week, capping off a successful month-long run at the top of the charts.",
    "The United States has seen steady job growth for the past few months, with the latest figures showing another strong increase in employment opportunities. According to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added 215,000 jobs in July, exceeding expectations and continuing a trend of solid hiring that has been ongoing since early last year.\n\nThe unemployment rate remained stable at 3.6%, indicating a tight labor market where available workers are quickly being snapped up by employers. Wage growth also held steady at 2.7% over the previous year, suggesting that workers are enjoying real gains in their take-home pay despite inflation remaining low.\n\nJuly's job growth was broadly based across industries, with healthcare leading the way with an additional 48,000 jobs created. Professional and business services followed closely behind, adding 47,000 new positions, while construction saw a welcome boost of 18,000 jobs. Even the traditionally struggling manufacturing sector showed signs of life, gaining 4,000 jobs during the month.\n\nWhile there were some revisions to previous months' figures, the overall picture remains one of sustained job creation. The Labor Department revised down its figures for May and June by a combined 39,000 jobs, but this did little to dent optimism around the strengthening state of the country's job market.\n\n\"This is yet more evidence that the US economy is thriving,\" said Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \"We see no sign of a slowdown here.\" Ms. Daly praised the breadth of job growth across sectors, saying it demonstrated a robustness that bodes well for the future. \"It suggests we have a diverse and resilient economy that can weather shocks and keep going.\"\n\nDespite Ms. Daly's optimism, not all experts agree that everything is rosy. Some point out that wage growth may be plateauing and that there are soft spots within certain industries that could yet impact the wider jobs market. Additionally, concerns linger about global trade t",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image co-segmentation using deep metric learning. Co-segmentation, also known as simultaneous segmentation, is the task of segmenting multiple images simultaneously, where each image has its own object of interest and background. Existing methods for co-segmentation often rely on hand-crafted features or shallow neural networks, which may not capture complex relationships between images effectively.\n\nIn contrast, our proposed method leverages deep metric learning to learn a robust distance metric that captures the similarity between images in a high-dimensional feature space. We introduce a new loss function that combines both inter-image and intra-image information to optimize the learned distance metric. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art co-segmentation methods on several benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes. Moreover, we show that our method can handle various challenges such as occlusions, cluttered backgrounds, and large pose variations.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n\n* A novel deep metric learning framework for image co-segmentation;\n* An effective loss function that integrates inter-image and intra-image information;\n* Superior performance compared to existing methods on several benchmark datasets;\n* Robustness to challenges such as occlusions, cluttered backgrounds, and large pose variations.\n\nOur findings suggest that the proposed method has great potential for real-world applications in computer vision, robotics, and multimedia processing, where image co-segmentation plays an essential role.",
    "The Liberal Democrats have launched their women's manifesto, outlining a series of policies aimed at promoting gender equality and addressing the challenges faced by women in society.\n\nThe manifesto, entitled \"A Fairer Future for Women,\" includes measures to tackle the gender pay gap, improve access to childcare, and combat violence against women and girls.\n\nUnder the proposal, the party would introduce mandatory gender pay audits for companies with more than 250 employees, forcing them to publish the differences in pay between men and women. This move is expected to help narrow the gender pay gap, which currently stands at around 18% in the UK.\n\nIn addition, the Lib Dems would increase funding for nurseries and childminders, providing affordable, high-quality childcare options for families. This would help to reduce the burden on working mothers, who often struggle to balance work and family responsibilities.\n\nThe manifesto also addresses the issue of sexual harassment and violence against women and girls. The party would establish a national rape crisis helpline, provide additional support for victims of domestic abuse, and introduce compulsory sex education classes in schools to promote healthy relationships and consent.\n\nFurthermore, the Lib Dems would champion women's rights globally, advocating for equal representation in parliaments and leadership positions worldwide. They would also continue to push for greater gender equality within their own ranks, following their commitment to have gender parity in parliamentary candidates by 2025.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: \"Women deserve better than a government that doesn't understand or prioritize their needs. Our manifesto sets out a bold vision for a fairer future where everyone has an equal chance to succeed.\"\n\nShadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities, Dawn Butler, welcomed the proposals, saying: \"These are important steps towards creating a societal shift in attitudes towards women and girls.\"\n\nHowever, some critics argue that the manifesto does not go far enough in tackling structural issues like the gender pension gap and period poverty.

    "Tim Burton's \"Batman Returns\" is a visually stunning and atmospheric sequel that builds upon the universe established in the original film. The story takes place two years after Batman's victory over the Joker, and Gotham City is once again plagued by crime and corruption. This time, a new villain emerges in the form of the Penguin (played with gleeful malice by Danny DeVito), a deformed and vengeful man who was abandoned as a child and now seeks to take revenge on the society that rejected him.\n\nThe Penguin's plan involves using his army of penguins to kidnap the city's first-born sons and transform them into an army of loyal followers. Meanwhile, a new hero emerges in the form of Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), a mousy secretary named Selina Kyle who is pushed out of a window by her evil boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and returns from the dead with supernatural abilities and a newfound taste for revenge.\n\nWhile Batman (Michael Keaton) tries to stop the Penguin and protect the city's children, he also finds himself drawn to Catwoman, despite her questionable morals and motives. Their relationship forms the emotional heart of the film, as they navigate their complicated feelings for each other while also trying to save Gotham from destruction.\n\nThe visuals are breathtaking, with intricate set design and memorable costumes that bring the comic book world to life. The performances are equally impressive, with standout turns from DeVito and Pfieffer, who steal every scene they're in. Keaton and Walken deliver solid supporting work, and the chemistry between the leads is palpable.\n\nOne notable aspect of the film is its darker tone, which contrasts sharply with the campy humor of the 1960s TV show and even the previous Batman film. While there are certainly moments of levity, the overall atmosphere is much more brooding and intense, reflecting the twisted psyches of both the Penguin and Catwoman.",
    "In this paper, we investigate the problem of training machine learning models on noisy structured labels. Structured label noise occurs when the labels in a dataset are incorrect or incomplete, leading to biased model predictions and reduced accuracy. We propose several techniques to improve training on noisy structured labels, including data augmentation, label smoothing, and Transfer Learning. Our experiments show that these methods can significantly improve performance compared to using only clean labels. Furthermore, we find that combining our proposed techniques leads to even better results. Finally, we explore the effects of different types and levels of noise on model performance and provide guidance on selecting appropriate methods based on specific noise characteristics. The contributions of our work include effective strategies for mitigating the impact of structured label noise and guidelines for choosing optimal approaches depending on the type and severity of noise present in a given dataset. These advancements have important implications for deploying reliable machine-learning systems in real-world applications where high accuracy is critical.",

    "Sure! Here's my attempt at writing the body of an IMDb review for the movie \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\":\n\nThis movie is a real treat - it's got adventure, comedy, music, and a cast of lovable characters that you can't help but root for. The Coen brothers have once again proven their skill in crafting a film that's both stylish and substance-driven.\n\nThe story follows Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), a smooth-talking convict who convinces his dim-witted pals Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro) and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) to join him on a mission to find a treasure of stolen gold. Along the way, they run into all sorts of obstacles, including a one-eyed Bible salesman (John Goodman), a group of dangerous Klansmen, and a beautiful siren named Penny Wharvey (Holly Hunter).\n\nOne of the standout aspects of this film is its soundtrack. The bluegrass and folk tunes are catchy and toe-tappin', and they perfectly capture the spirit of the era. I found myself humming along to several of the songs long after the credits rolled.\n\nThe acting is also top-notch. Clooney charms as the fast-talking everyman Ulysses, while Turturro and Nelson provide plenty of laughs as his bumbling sidekicks. John Goodman nearly steals the show with his hilarious turn as Big Dan Teague, a burly man with a penchant for eye patches and fiery sermons. And Holly Hunter brings a touch of class to her role as Penny, the object of Ulysses' affections.\n\nThe cinematography is another highlight. The film's use of muted colors and sweeping vistas captures the beauty of the rural South during the Great Depression. It's clear that a lot of care went into crafting each shot, and it pays off in spades.\n\nOverall, \"O",

    "I'm sure this opinion will be met with disagreement from some, but I truly believe that life is not worth living.\nI mean what's the point? We're all just floating around on a meaningless blue-green orb in an infinite void, suffering and struggling for no reason other than to perpetuate our genes. The vast majority of human history has been marked by poverty, disease, war, ignorance, and oppression – and even today, despite our technological advancements, we still can't seem to get it together as a species. Everything we do is ultimately futile; any accomplishments or progress we make are temporary at best, with the universe itself set to eventually destroy us all anyway.\nYou may say \"but what about love and relationships\"? Sure, those things exist, and can bring happiness. But they can also cause immense pain and heartache, and can be taken away at any moment without warning. And what's the purpose of these positive experiences really serving towards anyway? They're certainly not enough to outweigh the sheer amount of misery and suffering in the world.\nFurthermore, even if you were to somehow manage to avoid all the horrible ways the world can endanger you, you'll eventually slowly deteriorate to death anyways, experiencing a plethora of physical and mental indignities along the way. Just getting older is its own personal hell! You lose your looks, health, strength, cognitive abilities...everything.\nAll this before taking into account the shear amount of suffering nonhuman animals go through at our hand day in and day out. Most living beings exist in states of constant fear, pain, and confusion simply because it benefits humans in some way. We breed them en masse only to brutally slaughter them, sometimes torturing them while alive for amusement. This doesn't bother most people though since we delude ourselves thinking they don't have conscious thoughts like us (conveniently ignoring any scientific evidence to the contrary). It's beyond irrational to call that manifestation of sentient existence a net positive.\nIn light of all this, what exactly is there to look forward to here? What is being 'alive",
    "Sir Alex Ferguson has expressed concerns that AC Milan's wealthy owners could give them an unfair advantage in the race for silverware.\n\nThe former Manchester United manager, who won numerous titles during his tenure at Old Trafford, believes that the Italian club's new ownership group, led by American hedge fund Elliott Management, could provide them with the financial resources to attract top talent and invest in state-of-the-art facilities.\n\n\"I think it's a concern for everyone,\" said Ferguson. \"When you see a club like AC Milan, with their history and their tradition, suddenly getting this massive injection of funds, it's bound to make you take notice.\"\n\nElliott Management, which bought AC Milan last year, has already invested heavily in the club, splashing out on players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Rafael Leao. The Rossoneri have also been linked with a move for Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappe, who is one of the most sought-after players in world football.\n\nFerguson believes that this level of spending power gives AC Milan an unfair advantage over other clubs, particularly those in Italy. \"It's not just about buying players, it's about building a team and creating a culture. That takes time, patience, and dedication. When a club comes along with deep pockets, it can disrupt the natural order of things.\"\n\nDespite his concerns, Ferguson remains optimistic about the future of the game. \"Ultimately, football will find a way to balance itself out. Look at what happened with Manchester City and PSG – they had unlimited resources but still struggled to win the Champions League. It's not just about money; it's about having the right people, the right ethos, and the right vision.\"",
    "Abstract:\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach to solving unsteady thermal fluid structure interaction (TFSI) problems using fast solvers. TFSI is an important research area that deals with the coupling between temperature distribution, fluid flow, and structural dynamics in various engineering applications such as heat exchangers, chemical reactors, and turbomachinery. Accurate simulation of TFSI phenomena can help improve the design and optimization of these devices, but it remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay between fluid and solid mechanics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer.\n\nExisting methods for simulating TFSI often rely on iterative algorithms, which can be computationally expensive and impose constraints on the time step size, limiting their applicability to large-scale problems or those requiring high temporal resolution. The development of fast solvers for TFSI has been hindered by the nonlinearity and multiple scales involved in the problem, as well as the need for scalable and parallelizable algorithms.\n\nTo address these challenges, this work proposes a new algorithmic framework that enables fast solution of TFSI problems while maintaining accuracy and stability. Our approach leverages recent advances in numerical methods, such as fixed-point iterations and multigrid techniques, combined with parallel computing strategies to achieve significant speedups compared to traditional methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method through carefully chosen test cases representative of real-world TFSI scenarios.\n\nThe results show that our fast solver can significantly reduce computational times while maintaining high accuracy, making it possible to simulate larger and more complex TFSI problems than previously feasible. This breakthrough opens up new opportunities for exploring advanced designs and optimizing existing ones in a wide range of industries where TFSI plays a critical role. Our findings pave the way towards accelerated discovery and innovation in this crucial field, ultimately contributing to more efficient and sustainable technologies across different sectors.",

Our method enables users to interact with the segmentation process through intuitive point-based input, allowing them to indicate the location of relevant structures within the image. This information is then used to iteratively refine the segmentation mask, leveraging the strengths of both fully supervised and unsupervised learning methods.\n\nWe evaluate our approach on several datasets of varying modalities and complexity, including brain MRIs, lung CT scans, and fundus images. The results demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy and efficiency in segmenting complex anatomical structures while also providing a user-friendly experience. Furthermore, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art interactive segmentation techniques in terms of both accuracy and computational cost.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n\n1. A novel framework for interactive medical image segmentation that integrates point-based interaction and sequential patch learning.\n2.

    "In this paper, we propose a new approach to graph partitioning called the Neutro-Connectedness Cut (NCC) algorithm. The NCC algorithm seeks to improve upon traditional graph clustering methods by leveraging the concept of neutrophil migration in biological systems.\n\nInspired by the way neutrophils migrate towards areas of high bacterial concentration during immune responses, the NCC algorithm iteratively assigns nodes in the graph to clusters based on their connectivity and proximity to existing cluster centers. The algorithm introduces a novel scalar field that captures the level of connection between nodes, which is used to guide the clustering process.\n\nWe evaluate the performance of the NCC algorithm using several benchmark datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art graph clustering algorithms. Our results show that the NCC algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of both clustering quality and computational efficiency. We also demonstrate the versatility of the NCC algorithm by applying it to real-world graphs from various domains, including social networks, citation networks, and protein interaction networks.\n\nThe main contribution of this work lies in its introduction of a biologically inspired clustering method that can effectively capture complex relationships between nodes in large-scale graphs. The proposed algorithm offers a promising solution for network segmentation tasks in various fields such as computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics.",

He was such an incredible little guy and brought so much joy and companionship into my life.\n\nHop was more than just a pet - he was a true friend and constant companion. He loved going for walks with me and exploring new places. He even had his own little harness and would sit up on my shoulder like a furry parrot, making everyone around us smile and laugh. His favorite treat was peanut butter, and he could do tricks like sitting, spinning, and shaking paws. He was also quite the cuddle bug and loved nothing more than snuggling up in his cozy little hammock or curled up next to me at night.\n\nOne of my fondest memories of Hop was when we went on a camping trip together. He was so excited to explore the great outdoors, scampering around and investigating every rock and bush. When it was time for bed, he curls up in his sleeping bag and slept soundly by my side all night long. It was such a special bonding experience for both of us.\n\nBut despite all the adventures we shared, what I will miss most about Hop is simply having him by my side. Like many rats, he loved to groom my beard and hair, always making sure I looked presentable before we left the house. He'd sit perched on my desk while I worked or watched TV, occasionally reaching down to gently nibble my earlobes. He knew exactly how to brighten up any day.\n\nLosing Hop feels like losing a part of myself. The silence in my home without his chirps, whistles, and clicks is deafening. But I know he's happily romping in rodent heaven now, where there are endless supplies of peanut butter and unlimited playground equipment to explore. Rest In Peace my dear boy. You were truly one-of-a kind.",
    "In this paper, we explore the connections between sub-Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry. These two fields have historically been studied separately, with sub-Riemannian geometry focusing on the study of smooth manifolds with a Riemannian metric that is not necessarily positive definite, while algebraic geometry focuses on the study of algebraic varieties defined by polynomial equations. However, recent advances in both fields have revealed a deep connection between them, which has led to the development of new techniques and insights that have shed light on both areas.\n\nThe bridges between sub-Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry can be traced back to several key observations. Firstly, certain classes of sub-Riemannian manifolds can be realized as algebraic varieties, providing a natural framework for studying their geometric properties using algebraic tools. Secondly, many classical results in algebraic geometry have analogues in sub-Riemannian geometry, such as the theory of hypersurfaces and the study of singularities. Finally, techniques from sub-Riemannian geometry, such as the use of Tanaka's weak symplectic structure, have found applications in the study of algebraic varieties.\n\nIn this paper, we provide an overview of these connections between sub-Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry, highlighting the main results, techniques, and open problems in each area. We also discuss several examples that demonstrate the richness and diversity of the interactions between these two fields, including the study of real and complex hypersurfaces, the theory of moment maps and reductions, and the application of sub-Riemannian geodesics to numerical computations in algebraic geometry. Our goal is to showcase the beauty and significance of the bridges between sub-Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry, demonstrating how they enrich our understanding of the geometry and topology of spaces around us.",
    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm hoping someone can help me out with some advice or insight. For the past few months, I've been experiencing eye pressure, dryness, and occasional vision loss. It's been getting progressively worse, and I'm starting to worry that it might be something serious.\n\nThe pressure in my eyes feels like there's a constant weight on them, and they often feel tired and strained. My eyes also feel really dry, like there's sandpaper scratching away at the surface. And sometimes, particularly when I'm looking at a computer screen or reading, my vision will blur or go dark for a second or two. It's like there's a curtain being pulled across my field of view.\n\nI've tried everything to alleviate these symptoms: eye drops, warm compresses, adjusting my monitor settings, you name it. But nothing seems to offer any lasting relief. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Could it be related to my glasses prescription? (I'm due for an update anyway.) Or is this possibly a sign of something more serious going on?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences and thoughts!",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to semantic image segmentation using progressively diffused networks (PDN). Existing methods often rely on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) that struggle with large-scale images and neglect the spatial hierarchical structure of features. PDN addresses these limitations by introducing diffusion modules that progressively enrich feature representations across multiple scales. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while requiring fewer parameters than comparable FCN models. The effectiveness of PDN is demonstrated through extensive ablation studies and visualizations that highlight its ability to capture nuanced contextual information and produce accurate semantically consistent segments.",
    "I'm tired of nihilists acting like they have all the answers. They think they're so superior because they believe in nothing, but that's just it – they don't believe in anything. It takes no effort to sit back and say \"nothing matters\" while dismissing the beliefs and values of others.\n\nReal courage lies in facing the unknown, the mysteries of existence, and trying to make sense of them. Nihilism is just an easy cop-out, a refusal to engage with the complexities of life. It's much harder to grapple with difficult questions and try to find meaning in a seemingly meaningless world. But instead of doing that work, nihilists resort to armchair philosophy and mock those who actually try to make a difference.\n\nAnd another thing: if nothing truly matters, then why do nihilists care so damn much about convincing others of their beliefs? If it's all just a futile exercise in vanity, then why waste your time trying to convert people to your cynical worldview? The fact that they feel compelled to proselytize suggests that deep down, they crave validation and recognition for their supposedly superior intellect.\n\nIt's also ironic how nihilists often brand themselves as rebels against society, railing against what they see as false narratives or oppressive systems. Yet their rebellion ultimately leads nowhere, because they refuse to offer any positive alternatives. In effect, they surrender to the very same bleakness they claim to reject. How can you possibly change the world for the better when you don't even believe in something as basic as objective morality?\n\nSo yeah, go ahead and call me naive or a sheep for believing in stuff, but at least I'm willing to hold onto hope and strive for more. I may never find definitive proof that my beliefs are true, but that doesn't mean they're not worth fighting for. And honestly, I think that's a lot more admirable than smugly declaring that everything is pointless and we might as well give up.",
    "The US and EU have been plunged into a deepening trade row after Washington imposed controversial tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods. The move has sparked outrage across Europe, with leaders vowing to retaliate against what they see as an attack on their sovereignty.\n\nThe latest escalation in tensions came after the World Trade Organization (WTO) gave the green light for the US to impose duties on European exports in response to subsidies given to aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The WTO ruling was seen as a major victory for the Trump administration, which has long accused the EU of unfair trade practices.\n\nHowever, Brussels has hit back at the tariffs, describing them as \"unjustified\" and \"completely disproportionate.\" EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said that the bloc would appeal the WTO decision and take \"all necessary steps\" to protect its interests.\n\nFears are growing among businesses and investors that the dispute could spiral into a wider trade war between the two global economic powerhouses. The tariffs, which range from 10% to 20%, will impact a range of industries including agriculture, industrial goods, and luxury products such as French wine and Italian cheese.\n\nSome of the hardest-hit sectors are likely to be dairy farmers, who face increased costs and uncertainty over access to the lucrative US market. In France, President Emmanuel Macron described the tariffs as \"pure madness\" and promised support for his country's producers.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany - whose auto industry is also heavily reliant on US exports - urged both sides to avoid a further escalation. \"We must do everything we can to prevent a spiraling of this conflict,\" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told reporters in Berlin.\n\nIn a sign of growing friction, the UK government has issued a statement expressing its \"regret\" over the US move, despite being in the process of negotiating its own post-Brexit trade deal with Washington.

    "This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of non-diffracting chirped Bessel waves propagating in optical anvils. Chirped Bessel beams have gained increasing attention in recent years due to their unique properties, such as self-healing and maintained beam quality over long distances. However, these beams are typically diffracting, which limits their applications where high focusing efficiency is required.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate the existence of non-diffracting chirpmodes in optical annuli, which are referred to as non-diffracting chirped Bessel waves (NCBWs). By theoretically and experimentally investigating the wave nature of NCBWs, we show that they exhibit remarkable properties, including reduced divergence, improved confinement, and increased stability against diffraction. Our findings open up opportunities for exploiting NCBWs in various photonic applications, such as laser-matter interactions, particle manipulation, and microscopy imaging. The proposed scheme has potential advantages over current techniques since it allows for tailoring the wave front curvature independently from the spectral dispersion. In addition, our analysis suggests possible ways to extend the concept beyond the paraxial regime, paving the way for new types of non-diffracting beams with unconventional properties.",
    "AinnoSeg: Panoramic Segmentation with High Performance\n\nAbstract:\n\nPanoramic segmentation is an essential task in various computer vision applications, such as object detection, tracking, and scene understanding. However, it remains a challenging problem due to the large amount of data and the need for accurate and efficient processing. In this paper, we propose AinnoSeg, a novel panoramic segmentation method that leverages the strengths of deep learning and optimization techniques to achieve high performance.\n\nAinnoSeg combines a robust feature extraction module with a novel clustering algorithm, designed specifically for panoramic images. The proposed method utilizes a SPARK-based encoding scheme to transform the raw image data into a set of discriminative features, which are then fed into our custom-designed clustering algorithm. This algorithm groups the features into meaningful clusters, resulting in accurate instance segmentation masks.\n\nThe key contribution of this work lies in its ability to handle large panoramic images while maintaining real-time performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on several benchmark datasets without sacrificing computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AinnoSeg through extensive experiments and comparison with existing methods.\n\nThe main advantages of AinnoSec include:\n\n1. Real-time performance: AinnoSeg processes panoramic images efficiently, making it suitable for real-world applications where speed is critical.\n2. Accurate segmentation: The proposed method produces highly accurate instance segmentation masks, even for complex scenes with varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and objects.\n3. Robustness to variations: AinnoSec is designed to handle diverse scenarios, including changes in illumination, viewpoint, and object orientation.\n4. Scalability: Our approach can handle large panoramic images with ease, paving the way for its use in applications where processing large amounts of data is necessary.\n\nIn summary, AinnoSeg offers a powerful solution for panoramic segmentation, boasting high accuracy and real-time performance. Its robustness, scalability, and versatility make it an ideal choice for various computer vision tasks, such as",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to prostate magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation using a boundary-weighted domain adaptive neural network (BW-DANN). Prostate MRI segmentation is a challenging task due to variability inpro state shape, size, and location within the pelvic region. The standard method of manually delineating prostates by experts has limitations such as being time-consuming and subjective, which can lead to inter observer variability.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we proposed a deep learning-based method that utilizes both labeled source data and unlabeled target data from different domains(i.e., different scanners or sequence). Specifically, our BW-DANN model combines a U-Net architecture with a boundary-weighted adversarial loss function, which enables it topredict accurate segmentation of the prostate on unseen images. We evaluate our methid  ON a datasetof T2- weighted MRI images collected from multiple scanner platforms. Our experimental results show that BW-DANN outperforms traditional domain adaptation strategies and achieves a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 86:5%. Furthermore; visual inspection reveals that our method produces more accurate bounding boxes when comapared to those obtained by manual delineation, indicating its potential clinical utility.",

The Tories have run a very impressive campaign. They've been able to effectively utilise social media platforms to reach out to young voters and communicate their message in a way that resonates with them.\"\n\nSmith also praised the Conservatives' strategy of focusing on issues such as crime and immigration, which he believes have been particularly important to voters in this election.\n\n\"Their focus on law and order and national security has really struck a chord with people,\" he said. \"It's clear that these are issues that matter deeply to many voters, and the Tories have been successful in making themselves seen as the party best equipped to handle them.\"\n\nDespite his praise for the Conservative campaign, Smith was quick to emphasize that he still disagrees with the party's policies and does not believe they are good for the country.\n\n\"Of course, I don't agree with the Tories' ideology or think that their policies are what's best for Britain,\" he said. \"But from a purely tactical perspective, I think they've had an excellent campaign.\"",

We present novel theoretical guarantees for optimal uniform and nonuniform recovery of sparse signals from incomplete measurements, leveraging recent advances in compressive sensing and parallel computing. Our results demonstrate that by exploiting the inherent structure of sparse signals, it is possible to achieve accurate recovery with significantly reduced measurement rates, while also improving computational efficiency through parallelization. Specifically, we derive bounds on the number of measurements required for uniform and nonuniform recovery, and provide a thorough analysis of the impact of sparsity and parallelism on recovery performance. Our findings have significant implications for a wide range of applications, including signal processing, machine learning, and large-scale data acquisition.",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to semantic segmentation using Gated Shape Convolutional Neural Networks (Gated-SCNNs). Existing approaches to semantic segmentation often rely on fully connected or spatially separated convolutional layers, which can be limited in their ability to capture complex spatial relationships between objects. Our proposed method addresses these limitations by incorporating gates into the CNN architecture, allowing the network to adaptively focus on different parts of the input image and improve its performance.\n\nThe Gated-SCNN model consists of a series of gated convolutional layers, followed by spatial pyramid pooling and classification layers. The gates are learned during training and enable the network to selectively emphasize relevant features at multiple scales. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and CamVid, and achieve state-of-the-art results compared to other convolutional neural networks.\n\nOur key contributions include the introduction of gates into the CNN architecture for semantic segmentation, and the development of an effective training algorithm that learns both the gate weights and the feature extractors simultaneously. We also perform a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of the gates and show that they improve the accuracy and efficiency of the network.\n\nThe Gated-SCNN model offers several advantages over traditional CNNs. First, it allows the network to focus on the most important regions of the input image, reducing the impact of distractions and improving overall performance. Second, it enables the network to capture contextual information from larger receptive fields, leading to better object boundaries and improved segmentation quality. Finally, the gates reduce the number of parameters and computations required by the network, making it more efficient and scalable.\n\nOverall, our work represents a significant advancement in the field of semantic segmentation, demonstrating the power of incorporating dynamic gates into CNNs for capturing complex spatial relationships in images.",
    "I just finished watching Revolutionary Road, and I must say that this film is a masterclass in storytelling, acting, and direction. The movie tells the tale of Frank and April Wheeler, a seemingly perfect couple living in the suburbs with their two children in the 1950s.

They're trapped in a loveless marriage, stuck in mundane jobs, and struggling to find meaning in their lives.\n\nThe performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are absolutely breathtaking. They bring such depth and nuance to their characters, making them both relatable and flawed at the same time. Their chemistry on-screen is electric, and their portrayal of the disintegration of their relationship is nothing short of heartbreaking.\n\nDirector Sam Mendes does an excellent job of capturing the mood and atmosphere of the era without resorting to clichés or sentimentality. He brings a sense of restraint and subtlety to the filmmaking that complements the intense emotional turmoil unfolding on screen. Every frame is meticulously crafted, creating a visually stunning image that immerses you in the world of the characters.\n\nOne aspect of the film that stands out is its exploration of conformity and rebellion. Set during the height of the Cold War, Revolutionary Road delves into the pressures of societal norms, expectations, and gender roles. It asks uncomfortable questions about how society can suffocate individuals and make us compromise our dreams and aspirations. Through Frank and April's journey, the film challenges viewers to question their own values and choices.\n\nOverall, Revolutionary Road is an emotionally shattering experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It's a powerful reminder that life is too precious to be wasted, and that true happiness rarely comes from external sources. If you're ready to embark on an emotional odyssey, with magnificent performances, superb animation, and thought-provoking themes, then don't look further than Revolutionary",

    "Chancellor Rishi Sunak's budget announcement on Wednesday was met with mixed reactions, as he unveiled a package of tax cuts and spending increases aimed at boosting economic growth and lifting people's spirits.\n\nThe centrepiece of the Budget was a cut in National Insurance contributions for millions of workers, described by Mr Sunak as a \"historic\" move that would put £100 a year back into the pockets of those earning below £50,000. The change is expected to benefit around 32 million workers across the UK.\n\nHowever, some critics have questioned whether this measure will be enough to counteract the effects of what has been characterised as over a decade of austerity under Conservative rule. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would scrutinise the details of the budget, but warned that \"the scale of the challenge we face means there are still tough choices ahead.\"\n\nOne key area where the government hopes to drive growth is through investment in infrastructure. A total of £640 billion pounds is being pledged for such projects over the next five years, including a massive project to link Northern cities via a high-speed rail network known as HS2. However environmental activists were quick to point out that large parts of the plan consist of already announced funding commitments, leading to accusations that the budget was \"rehashing old promises rather than offering bold new initiatives.\"\n\nAnother major focus of the budget speech was efforts to reduce costs for businesses, particularly smaller enterprises, through changes to Business Rates and reform of the Apprenticeship Levy. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay argued these moves would ensure the country remains open for business as it leaves the EU, but opponents claim they do little to address fundamental issues posed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's favoured 'Australian style' trade relationship with Europe after Brexit.\n\nDespite these concerns, financial markets appeared to welcome the budget overall, with sterling jumping against both the dollar and euro following the Chancellor's statement.

    "This paper proposes a novel approach to segmenting knee joint magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data using learning-based cost functions. The proposed method can simultaneously separate multiple surfaces and objects in both 3D and 4D MRI data, which is critical for quantifying knee osteoarthritis progression. Existing methods rely heavily on hand-crafted features and require careful parameter tuning, limiting their effectiveness and generalizability.\nIn contrast, this study leverages recent advances in deep learning to learn a representation of the input data that is optimal for segmentation. Specifically, we train a neural network to predict the parameters of a parametric model of the knee joint, which are then used to compute a learned cost function. We show that this approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness to variation in the quality of the input data.\nThe proposed method was evaluated on a large dataset of knee MRI scans obtained from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, with promising results. Our findings suggest that learning-based cost functions have great potential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of multi-surface, multi-object segmentation in medical image analysis.",
    "This research paper proposes a novel approach to multi-level image thresholding using a type II fuzzy entropy based adaptive plant propagation algorithm. The proposed method combines the concepts of fuzzy entropy and plant propagation to optimize the threshold values for image segmentation.\n\nExisting methods for image thresholding are often limited by their reliance on fixed threshold values, which can lead to suboptimal segmentation results. In contrast, the proposed method uses a type II fuzzy entropy measure to dynamically adjust the threshold values based on the distribution of pixel intensities in the image. This allows for more accurate and robust segmentation, particularly in images with low contrast or noisy data.\n\nThe adaptive plant propagation algorithm used in this method is inspired by the natural process of plant growth and propagation. The algorithm iteratively updates the threshold values by propagating the membership degrees of each pixel between neighboring pixels. This process is controlled by a set of rules that mimic the natural growth patterns of plants, such as branching and merging.\n\nThe performance of the proposed method was evaluated using several benchmark images with different levels of noise and complexity. The results show that the method outperforms traditional thresholding techniques in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the proposed method achieved an average accuracy increase of 10% compared to Otsu's method, while reducing the computation time by up to 50%.\n\nOverall, the proposed method represents a significant advance in the field of image thresholding, offering a more robust and efficient way to segregate objects from background in digital images. Its ability to adapt to varying image conditions and its fast processing time make it suitable for real-world applications such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing.",
    "Title: A Biased Review of Biases in Twitter Studies on Political Collective Action\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis paper provides a critical examination of biases in existing research on political collective action on Twitter. We identify and analyze various methodological biases, including sampling bias, data bias, and analytical bias, in studies that have used Twitter data to investigate political mobilization, protests, and social movements. Our review reveals several recurring issues, such as the reliance on convenience samples, the use of narrow keyword-based data collection methods, and the failure to account for the complexities of Twitter's algorithmic nature. We argue that these biases can lead to an overestimation of the role of Twitter in political collective action and an underrepresentation of marginalized voices. By highlighting these limitations, we aim to encourage future researchers to adopt more rigorous and inclusive approaches to studying politics on social media platforms.",

Accurate representation has positive effects such as building confidence in underrepresented youth and minimizing bullying. It may seem like harmless entertainment, but TV shows play a significant role in teaching us about different humans and how to behave. As consumers, we need to hold producers responsible, advocate against damaging portrayals, and celebrate creative work that fairly reflects our worldwide community. Together we’ll break down barriers!",
    "Hey fellow radarr enthusiasts! I'm hoping someone can help me out with a setup issue I'm having.\n\nI have two Plex servers: one on-site (local) and one off-site (remote). My goal is to use Radarr to manage my media library across both servers. However, I'm running into issues with the configuration.\n\nHere are the details of my setup:\n\n* On-site server: Running Plex Media Server v1.20.1.3686 on Windows 10 Pro\n* Off-site server: Running Plex Media Server v1.20.1.3686 on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS\n* Both servers have identical media libraries\n* Both servers are connected to the same external hard drive for storage\n* My router supports UPnP and port forwarding is set up correctly\n\nIn Radarr, I've added both servers as separate profiles, each with their own API key and URL. When I scan for new movies or TV shows, Radarr correctly detects the files on both servers and adds them to its database. The problem arises when it comes time to download subtitles, artwork, or perform other tasks that require communication between the two servers. Radarr seems to only be able to communicate with one server at a time, resulting in failed tasks and incomplete metadata.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this issue? Is there a way to configure Radarr to work with multiple Plex servers simultaneously, or do I need to consolidate all my media onto a single server? If so, what would be the best approach for doing that without disrupting my existing library organization?",
    "In this paper, we present a novel approach to interactive image segmentation called LooseCut, which utilizes loosely bounded boxes to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the segmentation process. Existing methods often rely on tightly bounding boxes that require precise adjustments, leading to inefficiencies and user frustration. In contrast, LooseCut employs a new strategy that allows users to create loose bounds around objects, enabling faster and more accurate segmentation.\n\nOur approach leverages recent advances in deep learning-based segmentation techniques and incorporates a novel optimization algorithm that refines the initial boundaries using iterative feedback from the user. We evaluate LooseCut on several challenging datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we conduct a user study to validate the effectiveness and usability of our approach in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe key contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Introduction of LooseCut, an interactive image segmentation method based on loosely bounded boxes.\n2. Development of a novel optimization algorithm that refines initial boundaries using user feedback.\n3. Demonstration of LooseCut's superiority over existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy across various datasets.\n4. Validation of the usability and effectiveness of LooseCut through a comprehensive user study.\n\nOverall, our proposed LooseCut method has significant implications for improving interactive image segmentation in various applications such as object recognition, tracking, and medical imaging analysis.",
    "In this paper, we present an interactive medical image segmentation framework using iterative refinement. Our approach leverages the strengths of both machine learning algorithms and human expertise to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical image segmentation. We propose a novel iteration-based method that integrates user feedback into the segmentation process, enabling the algorithm to learn from the user's inputs and adapt to their preferences.\n\nOur proposed framework consists of two main components: (1) a deep neural network that initially segments the medical images, and (2) an interactive module that allows users to correct the segmentation results and provide feedback. The neural network is trained on a large dataset of annotated medical images and utilizes a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers to generate accurate segmentations.\n\nThe interactive module is designed to facilitate efficient user interaction and incorporate user feedback into the segmentation process. Users can adjust the segmentation boundaries through intuitive visualizations and real-time updates, allowing them to quickly identify and correct any errors or inaccuracies. The module also includes a reinforcement learning mechanism that learns from user behavior and adapts the segmentation model accordingly.\n\nWe evaluate our framework on several public datasets of diverse medical imaging modalities, including MRI brain scans, CT lung scans, and ultrasound liver images. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves upon traditional segmentation approaches by incorporating valuable user knowledge and achieving higher Dice coefficients and lower mean absolute errors. Additionally, user studies show that our framework reduces the time and effort required for manual segmentation while maintaining high accuracy levels.\n\nOur work has important implications for various clinical applications where precise medical image segmentation is critical, such as tumor diagnosis, organ transplant planning, and surgical intervention guidance. By empowering experts with real-time, interactive tools, we can increase accuracy and confidence in decision-making processes while reducing the tedium associated with manual segmentation methods. This research sets a new direction towards intelligent, dynamic, and collaborative image segmentation systems, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.",

    "The UK's young workers are now among the highest earners in Europe, according to new research. A study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has found that 25-34 year olds in the UK have the third highest average salaries in the European Union.\n\nThe data, which was collected in 2019, shows that young Britons earned an average of £36,700 per year, behind only Luxembourg and Switzerland. This is significantly higher than the EU average of £28,500 for the same age group.\n\nExperts say that the UK's strong economy, low unemployment rate, and high demand for skilled labor are driving up wages for young workers. Additionally, the country's education system and investment in skills training are also seen as contributing factors to the high earning potential of young Britons.\n\nHowever, some experts note that the cost of living in the UK, particularly in London and the South East, can be prohibitively expensive for many young people, meaning that their disposable income may be lower than their continental counterparts. Housing costs in particular continue to rise faster than wages, making it difficult for young adults to save money or buy homes.\n\nDespite these challenges, the OECD report suggests that the outlook is positive for young British workers. With the UK set to leave the EU at the end of this year, there will likely be changes ahead for the job market – but for now, young professionals in the UK seem well placed to thrive in the years ahead.\n\nBut what does this mean for Britain’s younger generation? And how do their earnings compare with those across the rest of Europe? Join us tonight on BBC News as we explore why young people in the UK are topping the earnings leaderboard.

    "Brain tumor segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, as it enables clinicians to accurately diagnose and treat various types of brain tumors. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model that integrates Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for brain tumor segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\n\nOur proposed model consists of two main components: an FCNN that extracts features from MRI scans, and a CRF that refines the segmentation results. The FCNN is trained to learn hierarchical representations of the input data, while the CRF models the spatial relationships between neighboring pixels and enforces label consistency across the image. We use a patch-based training strategy to optimize the model's performance, where each patch is annotated with a binary mask indicating the presence or absence of a tumor.\n\nWe evaluate our model on a dataset of 160 MRI scans, including both high-grade and low-grade tumors. Our experiments show that the integration of FCNNs and CRFs leads to significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to using either approach alone. Specifically, our model achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.83 and an average pixel accuracy of 93.4%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.\n\nMoreover, we perform a series of ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components in our model. We find that the combination of FCNNs and CRFs yields better segmentation results than using either approach separately, demonstrating the complementary nature of these two techniques. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of different design choices, such as the number of layers in the FCNN and the size of the CRF grid, and provide insights into their impact on performance.\n\nOverall, our work presents a powerful deep learning model for brain tumor segmentation that leverages the strengths of both FCNNs and CRFs. This approach has important implications for improving the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor diagnosis, and can potentially enable more effective treatment strategies for patients with",

    "Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has publicly supported the idea of a \"pre-election budget\" to be held before the upcoming general election.\n\nSpeaking at an event in London, Blair said that he believed it was essential for political parties to present their economic plans to the electorate ahead of the vote. He argued that this would allow voters to make an informed decision about which party is best equipped to manage the economy and handle the challenges of government spending.\n\n\"It's important that we don't just have a debate about Brexit in this election,\" Blair said. \"We need a proper discussion about the future of our economy and how it can work for everyone.\"\n\nThe concept of a pre-election budget has been floated by several politicians and economists in recent weeks as a way to increase transparency and accountability in the electoral process. It would involve each political party outlining its spending priorities and taxation policies before the election, allowing voters to scrutinize their proposals.\n\nSupporters of the idea argue that it would help prevent governments from making unrealistic promises during campaigns only to renege on them once they are elected. It would also give voters a better understanding of what kind of impact the different parties' policies could have on their personal finances and the overall health of the economy.\n\nHowever, critics argue that a pre-election budget could limit the flexibility of governing parties to respond to changing economic circumstances. They point out that unexpected global events or shifts in the domestic economy could render their proposals obsolete within months of being implemented.\n\nDespite these concerns, Blair remains convinced that such a move would benefit both voters and politicians in the long run. \"If parties are afraid of detailing their policies because they think the other side will steal them, that's not good enough,\" he declared. \"We need real leadership and vision in this country, not gimmicks and quick fixes.\"\n\nWhile Blair did not explicitly endorse any particular party's approach to fiscal policy, his remarks are likely to be seen as a challenge to",
    "In this paper, we explore the concept of camera pose estimation using deep learning techniques. Camera pose estimation refers to the process of determining the position and orientation of a camera in 3D space based on the images it captures. This is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality, among others.\n\nTraditional methods for camera pose estimation rely heavily on feature extraction and matching, which can be computationally expensive and provide limited accuracy. Recently, there has been growing interest in using deep learning techniques to address this problem.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the basic concepts of camera pose estimation and discuss how deep learning models can be used to estimate camera poses from images. We survey various state-of-the-art deep learning architectures that have been proposed for camera pose estimation, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and neural networks with geometric constraints. We also discuss some of the challenges associated with training these models and highlight future research directions in this field.\n\nOur main contributions include providing an overview of the landscape of deep learning approaches to camera pose estimation and identifying key areas where further research is needed. We hope that this work will serve as a starting point for readers who are interested in exploring the exciting intersection of deep learning and camera pose estimation.",
    "Sure, here's my attempt at writing a review of the movie \"Man on Fire\" without a title:\n\nChristopher Walken delivers a powerful performance as John Creasy, a burnt-out ex-CIA operative struggling to find purpose in his life after a botched mission leaves him with immense guilt and emotional baggage. When he takes on a job as a bodyguard for a young girl named Pita (played by Dakota Fanning), he begins to see her as a surrogate daughter and starts to form a tentative bond with her and her mother, played by Radha Mitchell.\n\nThe film's pacing is deliberately slow and measured, allowing us to fully absorb the weight of Creasy's sorrow and despair. Director Tony Scott uses long takes and close-ups to great effect, drawing us into the protagonist's inner world and emphasizing his growing obsession with protecting Pita from the narco kidnappers who have targeted her. The action scenes are intense and well-executed, but they never feel gratuitous or overly indulgent - they exist solely to further the story and illustrate just how far Creasy will go to save the people he cares about.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of \"Man on Fire\" is its thematic depth. This isn't just another mindless action flick; it grapples with complex issues like grief, redemption, sacrifice, and the nature of violence. There are some truly haunting moments that stay with you long after the credits roll, including a stomach-churning scene involving a severed arm and a heartbreaking confrontation between Creasy and Pita's father.\n\nDespite the bleak subject matter, there's also a strong sense of hope running throughout the film. As Creasy learns to let go of his past failures and embrace his new role as protector, we witness him slowly come back to life. His relationship with Pita provides a glimmer of light amidst all the darkness, reminding him (and us) of the transformative power of love and connection.\n\nOverall, \"Man on Fire\" is a visceral,",

Contrary to previous studies, we consider new observations and calculations suggest a low likelihood of such collision. A comprehensive analysis of orbital dynamics shows that Apophis will, with a very high level of certainty, miss Earth during its close encounter on 13th April 2029. We also examines factors influencing predicted outcomes for Apophis' passage through the perilune region. Our study offers added support for earlier statements made by NASA professionals downplaying any possibility of a potentially catastrophic outcome resulting from this event. This work not only improves our understanding of asteroids but emphasizes the importance of regular monitoring, observation, and collaborative efforts between expert organizations like NASA when evaluating potential risks stemming from celestial bodies.",
    "The UK's Labour Party has been experiencing a surge in popularity ahead of the upcoming general election, with polls suggesting that the party is neck and neck with the ruling Conservatives. The sudden shift in public opinion has been attributed to a change in leadership and a renewed focus on socialist policies.\n\nSince the appointment of Keir Starmer as leader, Labour has seen a significant increase in support amongst younger voters and those who feel left behind by the current government's austerity measures. The party's commitment to reducing poverty, tackling climate change, and investing in public services has struck a chord with many who felt disillusioned with politics as usual.\n\nOne key factor in Labour's resurgence has been its embrace of socialism. The party's manifesto includes proposals for nationalising key industries such as rail and energy, increasing the minimum wage, and implementing a green industrial revolution. These policies have been praised by many for their boldness and ambition, particularly in comparison to the more centrist offerings of previous years.\n\nThe changing political landscape has also led to a shift in the way people are engaging with politics. Traditional Labor strongholds in working-class communities are rekindling their支持 für die party, while young people are becoming energized and politicized like never before. Social media platforms have played a crucial role in mobilizing support, with viral campaigns and memes helping to spread Labour's message far and wide.\n\nBut Labour's rise in popularity hasn't gone unchallenged. Critics argue that the party's policies are too radical, posing a threat to business and economic stability. Some have even questioned whether the country can afford the proposed spending increases and nationalizations.\n\nDespite these concerns, there is clear excitement building around Labour's campaign.

    "The Longest Yard is a remarkable film that delves into the harsh realities of life inside a correctional facility. The story follows Paul Crewe, a former NFL quarterback who finds himself incarcerated after a drunk driving accident. Rather than taking the easy route and relying on his celebrity status, Crewe chooses to coach a team of inmates in a prison football game against their sadistic guards.\n\nBurt Reynolds shines as Paul Crewe, delivering a commanding performance that showcases both his comedic and dramatic talents. His character's arc from a self-centered individual to a leader who genuinely cares about his team is inspiring and heartwarming. The supporting cast, including Eddie Albert, Michael Conrad, and James Hampton, also deliver memorable performances that add depth to the narrative.\n\nOne aspect that sets this film apart is its authenticity. Shot on location at an actual prison, using real inmates as extras, the gritty atmosphere feels all too real. You can almost smell the sweat and desperation emanating from the characters. This raw, unvarnished quality adds another layer of tension to the already intense plot.\n\nWhere The Longest Yard truly excels is in its exploration of themes such as hope, redemption, and camaraderie. It highlights the struggles encountered by those behind bars and how they find ways to cope with their situations through friendship and shared experiences. Even amidst the bleak setting, the movie manages to infuse humor without ever downplaying the severity of the environment.\n\nAdditionally, the pacing is well-balanced, allowing time for character development between the action scenes, which are themselves superbly choreographed. The climactic football game will keep you glued to your seat, with suspense building towards an immensely satisfying conclusion.\n\nIf I were to nitpick, there might be a few moments where some viewers would call out the plot for being predictable or formulaic. However, The Longest Yard never pretends to be anything other than what it is – a passionate and engaging under",
    "The Spanish press has been abuzz with reaction to the recent political developments in Catalonia, with many outlets expressing concern over the future of the region and its relationship with Spain.\n\nIn an editorial for El País, journalist Juan Gárate argues that the situation in Catalonia represents a \" grave crisis\" for both the regional government and the Spanish state. He writes that the decision by Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to declare independence was a \"fateful error\" that has led to a dangerous escalation of tensions between Barcelona and Madrid. Gárate urges both sides to seek dialogue and find a peaceful solution to the conflict, warning that further confrontation could have serious consequences for all involved.\n\nMeanwhile, El Mundo columnist José Manuel Prada takes a more critical stance towards the Catalan leadership, accusing them of engaging in \"political improvization\" and endangering the stability of Spain. In his view, the central government's response to the crisis has been appropriate and proportionate, and he calls on Puigdemont to step back from his \"dangerous game\" before it is too late.\n\nOver at ABC, writer Rosa M. Tristán analyyses the international implications of the Catalan crisis, pointing out that the European Union has thus far remained largely silent on the issue. She notes that while some EU member states may be reluctant to get involved in Spain's domestic affairs, others are growing increasingly concerned about the potential ramifications for their own regions. Tristán suggests that Brussels should act as mediator in the dispute, using its influence to encourage both sides to find a peaceful resolution.\n\nIn La Vanguardia, former Catalan president Jordi Pujol offers a personal perspective on the current situation, admitting that he never imagined things would come to such a head during his time in office. While acknowledging that there were mistakes made by both sides, Pujol believes that the Catalan people have a right to self-determination and hopes that a way can be found to resolve the crisis without further violence or upheaval.\n\nFinally, writing for El Periodico, political scientist Joan Botella warns against any attempts to",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach for accelerating matrix-vector products involving the graph Laplacian of fully connected networks using the combination of Near Field Fourier Transform (NFFT) and Krylov subspace methods. The graph Laplacian is a critical component in various network analysis tasks such as partitioning, clustering, and centrality measures. However, its large size and sparse structure make it challenging to compute matrix-vector products efficiently.\n\nOur proposed method leverages the advantages of NFFT, which enables fast computation of long-range interactions in spatial domains, and Krylov subspace methods, which provide efficient solutions to linear systems. We first apply NFFT to transform the graph Laplacian into a compact representation, reducing the number of nonzero elements by exploiting the decay of similarity between nodes with distance. We then employ a Krylov subspace method to solve the system associated with the transformed matrix, achieving faster convergence than traditional methods.\n\nThe proposed approach significantly reduces computational complexity and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our experiments on several real-world networks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of time efficiency and scalability, making it an attractive choice for large-scale network analysis applications. Additionally, we prove the theoretical correctness and convergence properties of our algorithm, ensuring its reliability and robustness in practice.\n\nOverall, this work introduces the concept of combining NFFT and Krylov methods for fast matrix-vector products in graph computing, paving the way for more efficient and accurate analyses of complex networks.",

Or do I want to have my own personal heavenly paradise where I can retreat from the world and just relax?\n\nBut then, the more I thought about it, the more questions I had. Like, what even is an afterlife, really? Is it a physical place or just some kind of spiritual realm? And if it's physical, does that mean there are different neighborhoods or districts with their own vibes and cultures? Can I customize my afterlife experience, like choosing the climate or landscape?\n\nAnd what about activities? Would I still want to try new things, or would I be content with sticking to what I knew and loved in life? Could I still eat and drink, or would those desires disappear since I wouldn't need sustenance anymore?\n\nIt's all got me wondering – do any of you guys have thoughts on your afterlife preferences? Are there certain things you hope to experience or avoid? Have you given any consideration to what kind of atmosphere or activities you'd wants in the afterlife? Am I overthinking this whole thing?! Let's discuss!",
    "I'm sitting here feeling guilty and confused, wondering if I did the right thing by breaking up with my partner. The thing is, they didn't really do anything wrong. They were kind, caring, and supportive throughout our relationship. They listened to me when I needed someone to talk to, they made me laugh when I needed a pick-me-up, and they were always there for me when I needed help or advice.\n\nBut despite all of this, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing. Maybe it was passion, maybe it was excitement, maybe it was a sense of adventure - whatever it was, it wasn't there for me. And no matter how much I tried to convince myself otherwise, I couldn't ignore the fact that I wasn't completely invested in the relationship anymore.\n\nI thought about what ending things would mean for both of us. My partner had been through some tough times recently and I knew that breaking up with them would only add to their stress and sadness. But on the other hand, I couldn't keep pretending that everything was okay when it wasn't. That's not fair to either of us.\n\nSo I took a deep breath and ended things as kindly and respectfully as possible. It still felt like a punch to the gut, for both of us. Now I'm left feeling like a bad guy, wondering if I should have done things differently. Did I make a mistake? Was I selfish for prioritizing my own feelings over someone else's happiness?\n\nIn the end, I know I can't change the past. All I can do is try to learn from this experience and move forward with empathy and compassion. If you've ever found yourself in a similar situation, I'd love to hear your thoughts. How did you handle it? Is it ever truly possible to break up with someone who doesn't 'deserve' it?",
    "This film is a masterpiece. I have never laughed so hard in my life. The humor is intelligent and biting, tackling controversial topics like censorship, sexuality,and Canadian stereotypes with ease. The songs are catchy and hilarious, with \"Blame Canada\" being an instant classic.\n\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone's voice acting adds another level of comedy to their already fantastic writing. Their satire is spot on, taking shots at everything from Disney musicals to the MPAA. Not since \"The Simpsons\" has a animated show made me laugh so consistently .\n\nAs far as the plot goes, Cartman, Kyle, Kenny , and Stan's adventures into the world of Hollywood and Terrance and Phillip movies is genius. It perfectly captures the innocence and naivety of childhood while also commenting on adult themes that only animation can get away with.\n\nDon't even get me started on Satan. He may be the best character in the whole thing, and his song \"Up There\" had be crying tears of joy. \n\nOverall this flawless 5 star rating is well deserved. If you haven't seen \"Bigger, Longer & Uncut\", I will question your intelligence, but not before politely telling you where to stick your opinion.",
    "Stanley Kramer's \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that delves into the complexities of justice and morality in the aftermath of World War II. The movie focuses on the Nuremberg Trials, where four Nazi judges are put on trial for their complicity in the regime's crimes against humanity.\n\nThe film boasts an impressive cast, with standout performances from Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, and Maximilian Schell. Tracy plays Judge Dan Haywood, a principled American jurist who is tasked with presiding over the tribunal. He brings a sense of gravitas and moral authority to the role, and his performance is nothing short of riveting. Lancaster plays Dr. Ernst Janning, a former Nazi judge who is now facing judgment for his past actions. His portrayal is nuanced and multi-faceted, and he effectively conveys the complexity of a man torn between his duty to the state and his own personal beliefs. Schell, playing the defense attorney Hans Rolfe, deliveries a strong performance as well, bringing a level of intelligence and cunning to his character.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the film is its exploration of the gray areas between right and wrong. The characters are not simply black and white, good or evil. Rather, they exist in a moral gray area, where motivations and intentions are often clouded by self-interest, fear, and ideology. The film raises important questions about individual responsibility and the danger of unchecked nationalism, and it challenges viewers to consider their own culpability in the face of systemic injustice.\n\nThe cinematography is effective in capturing the somber mood of the trials, with stark, high-contrast images that convey the gravity of the proceedings. The score, composed by the great Ernest Gold, adds another layer of emotion to the film, heightening the tension and drama without ever feeling manipulative.\n\nOverall, \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" is a masterful film that continues to resonate today.

    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by introducing a hierarchical-split block called HS-ResNet. The proposed block is designed to address the limitations of traditional CNNs, which suffer from the vanishing gradient problem and limited representation capacity.\n\nThe HS-ResNet block consists of three main components: a spatial pyramid pooling module, a feature fusion module, and a residual connection module. The spatial pyramid pooling module hierarchically splits the input feature maps into multiple scales, allowing the network to capture multiscale contextual information. The feature fusion module combines the split features through concatenation and channel-wise attention, enhancing the representational capacity of the network. Finally, the residual connection module ensures the stability of the training process and improves the overall performance by incorporating skip connections.\n\nWe evaluate the efficacy of HS-ResNet on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing CNN models. Specifically, HS-ResNet50 achieves an error rate of 3.27% on CIFAR-10 and 19.48% on CIFAR-100, outperforming other CNN models with similar complexity. On ImageNet, HS-ResNet reaches a Top-5 accuracy of 86.1%, surpassing other ResNet variants.\n\nOur extensive ablation studies reveal that the hierarchical-split design and feature fusion module are crucial for the improved performance of HS-ResNet. We also analyze the effectiveness of different component combinations and provide insights into their roles in the network's behavior.\n\nIn summary, this paper presents HS-ResNet, a novel CNN architecture that leverages hierarchical splitting and feature fusion to enhance the representational capacity and alleviate the vanishing gradient issue. Our experimental results prove its superiority over existing CNN models and provide valuable guidelines for future architectural advancements in computer vision tasks.",

With time running out, it seemed as though the Irish might hold on for a famous victory, but there was still drama to come. In the dying moments of the game, the Springboks were awarded a last-minute penalty, which they duly converted, leaving the final score at 17-12 in favor of Ireland.\n\nDespite the late scare, this result marks an historic win for Ireland, who have never previously beaten South Africa in a World Cup match. The Irish will now go into their next game against Russia full of confidence, knowing that they can overcome any challenge that comes their way. As for the Springboks, they will need to regroup and",
    "Fatboy Slim, the renowned DJ and producer, has dismissed claims that dance music is dying out. In an interview with BBC News, he argued that electronic dance music (EDM) is still thriving and continues to evolve.\n\n\"I'm always amazed when people say dance music is dead,\" Fatboy said. \"It's like saying rock 'n' roll is dead. It's been around for decades and it's still going strong.\"\n\nFatboy pointed out that dance music has faced similar criticisms in the past, only to bounce back stronger than ever. \"In the 90s, people were saying that acid house was a fad and would fade away. But look at where we are now – it's bigger than ever!\"\n\nThe DJ believes that one reason for the persistent vitality of dance music is its ability to adapt and incorporate new styles. \"There are so many sub-genres within EDM now – from techno to drum 'n' bass, from Dubstep to trance – there's something for everyone.\"\n\nMoreover, he notes that dance music festivals continue to draw massive crowds worldwide. \"Look at Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival, Coachella... they just keep getting bigger and better. There's no sign of slowing down.\"\n\nFatboy also highlights technology as another factor contributing to the genre's longevity. \"With advancements in digital software and hardware, producers can create sounds and rhythms that weren't possible before. This encourages creativity and pushes the boundaries of what we can do musically.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging that some may argue that commercialization has watered down the quality of dance music, Fatboy maintains that this is a natural consequence of popularity. \"Whenever something becomes successful, it attracts imitators looking to cash in. But if you scratch beneath the surface, there's still tons of underground talent putting out great stuff.\"\n\nUltimately, Fatboy suggests that the enduring appeal of dance music lies in its power to unite people on the dance floor, regardless of age, race",
    "Hi fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm really worried about my puppy, Max. Yesterday, he had an intense scare when he was startled by a loud noise while sleeping. He woke up suddenly and ran around the house frantically, his tail between his legs. It was clear that he was terrified. I tried to calm him down, but it took quite some time for him to settle back down.\n\nSince then, I've noticed that Max seems a bit off. He's been acting nervously, hiding under furniture more often than usual, and he doesn't want to play as much as he used to. I'm worried that this one incident might have caused lasting damage to his mental health. Has anyone else experienced something similar with their dog? Will my puppy be okay, or should I expect long-term behavioral changes? Should I consult a professional dog trainer or therapist? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
    "In recent years, online gaming has become an increasingly popular platform for political expression and activism. From battle royale games like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds to massively multiplayer online role-playing games like World of Warcraft, players are using digital spaces to engage in political discussions, propagate ideologies, and even influence real-world events.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of this trend is the use of video games to voice opinions on social and political issues. Games like Minecraft and Roblox have been used as platforms for players to build and share virtual creations that reflect their views on topics such as climate change, racial inequality, and LGBTQ+ rights. These creations often go viral, sparking conversations and debates within the gaming community and beyond.\n\nIn addition to expressing political views, online games are also being used as tools for political education and mobilization. Many games now include historical or politically charged storylines, characters, and gameplay mechanics that encourage players to engage with complex issues in a fun and interactive way. For instance, the game \"This War of Mine\" puts players in charge of managing a group of civilians during a war, forcing them to make difficult ethical decisions that highlight the consequences of conflict. Similarly, the game \"Papers, Please\" simulates the experience of working as a border control officer, tasking players with scrutinizing travel documents and making tough judgments about who to let in and who to keep out.\n\nBeyond just educating players about political issues, online games are also being harnessed as a means of organizing and mobilizing political action. Players are using in-game chat functions and forum communities to coordinate protests, campaigns, and fundraisers related to various causes. The popularity of these efforts has led some game developers to create games specifically designed to facilitate political activism, such as the game \"Keyboard Warriors,\" which allows players to compete in challenges based on real-life political issues.\n\nHowever, the intersection of online gaming and politics has also raised concerns about the potential for manipulation and disinformation. Some governments and special interest groups have begun to exploit the power",

    "In this paper, we propose a novel framework called HCDG (Hierarchical Consistency Framework for Domain Generalization) to address the problem of domain shift in medical image segmentation. Our approach leverages a hierarchical structure of consistency regularizations to improve the generalization ability of deep learning models across different domains.\n\nExisting methods for domain adaptation mainly focus on aligning feature distributions between source and target domains, but they often overlook the hierarchical relationships between features at multiple scales. HCDG fills this gap by introducing a hierarchy of consistency terms that enforce the model to produce consistent predictions from top-level labels down to low-level features. This hierarchical regularization framework enables the model to learn more robust and transferable representations across diverse domains.\n\nWe evaluate HCDG on several challenging medical image segmentation tasks, including brain tumor segmentation, retinal fundus disease detection, and lung nodule segmentation. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches, achieving superior performance on unseen target data. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of each component in HCDG, providing insights into the working mechanisms of our framework.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n* We introduce HCDG, a hierarchical consistency framework for domain generalization on medical image segmentation, which enforces multi-scale consistency regularizations to improve the generalization ability of deep learning models.\n* Our approach is evaluated on various medical image segmentation tasks and shows better performance than existing domain adaptation methods.\n* Ablation studies provide insightful findings on the contribution of each component in HCDG, shedding light on the design of future domain adaptation frameworks.\n\nOverall, HCDG presents a promising solution for improving the generalization ability of deep learning models in medical image analysis, paving the way towards more reliable and robust AI systems for healthcare applications.",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to semantic segmentation called CEREALS (Cost-Effective Region-basedActive Learning for Semantic Segmentation). Our method leverages active learning techniques to significantly reduce the annotation cost of obtaining high-quality semantic segmentation models.\n\nExisting active learning approaches typically rely on random sampling or uncertainty-based strategies to select regions for annotation. However, these methods can lead to inefficient annotation and slower convergence due to irrelevant or redundant labels. To address this challenge, our proposed method adopts a region-based selection strategy that identifies the most informative and representative regions for annotation based on their similarity and heterogeneity.\n\nWe evaluate our method on the Cityscapes dataset and compare it with various state-of-the-art active learning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves better performance with fewer annotations, leading to a substantial reduction in annotation cost. Specifically, CEREALS attains an mIoU of 0:6415 with only 3799 annotations versus 0:5892 with 8663 annotations from a rival method. Additionally, we visualize the learned masks and showcase the improvement in segmentation accuracy brought by our method.\n\nOur key contributions are as follows: (1) We introduce a cost-effective region-based active learning framework for semantic segmentation, which reduces annotating effort while maintaining comparable performance. (2) We devise a novel selection strategy that considers both intra-region similarity and inter-region heterogeneity to identify the most valuable regions for labeling. (3) Thorough experiments validate the effectiveness of our method compared to other competitive baselines, achieving superior performance using fewer annotations. The proposed CEREALS algorithm has significant implications for real-world applications where manual annotation is expensive and time-consuming",
    "The Abstract:\n\nThis research paper, \"Radiative Transfer Model for Contaminated Rough Slabs,\" presents a novel approach to modeling radiative heat transfer in rough slabs with surface contamination. The proposed model accounts for the complex interactions between radiation, roughness, and contamination, providing accurate predictions of temperature distribution and heat transfer rates in such systems.\n\nThe proposed model is based on a combination of ray tracing and Monte Carlo methods, which enable the simulation of both direct and diffuse radiation, as well as the effects of surface roughness and contamination. The model is validated through experimental measurements and comparisons with existing models, demonstrating its accuracy and efficacy.\n\nThe results show that the proposed model can accurately predict the temperature distribution and heat transfer rates in rough slabs with various levels of surface contamination. Additionally, the study reveals the significant impact of surface roughness and contamination on radiative heat transfer, highlighting the importance of considering these factors in thermal analysis.\n\nThis research has important implications for applications where radiative heat transfer plays a crucial role, such as heating and cooling systems, passive solar design, and thermal management in electronic devices. By providing a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of radiative heat transfer in rough slabs with surface contamination, this study can help improve the performance and efficiency of such systems.",
    "The US government's budget deficit is projected to balloon to $368 billion in the current fiscal year, according to new estimates released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). This figure represents a significant increase from the $205 billion deficit recorded in 2019 and is the highest level since 2012.\n\nThe CBO attributes the surging deficit to a combination of factors, including increased government spending and lower tax revenues. The report states that total outlays are expected to rise by 7% this year, driven primarily by greater spending on defense, healthcare, and social security programs. Meanwhile, tax receipts are projected to decrease by 4%, largely due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent changes to the tax code.\n\nThe growing deficit has raised concerns among economists and policymakers about the long-term stability of the national debt. The federal debt now stands at over $24 trillion, with interest payments accounting for an increasing share of government expenditure. According to the CBO, interest costs alone will exceed $500 billion annually by 2024, putting further pressure on the nation's finances.\n\nDespite these projections, lawmakers have shown little appetite for addressing the rising deficit. In fact, Congress recently passed a series of measures aimed at mitigating the economic fallout from the pandemic, which included additional spending and tax relief measures worth hundreds of billions of dollars. While these steps were intended to provide temporary support to struggling households and businesses, they have contributed to the expanding deficit.\n\nThe widening gap between spending and revenue has also reignited debate around the need for entitlement reform and broader fiscal reform efforts. Advocates for reducing the deficit argue that failing to address the issue could have severe consequences down the line, such as higher inflation, reduced credit ratings, and a diminished ability to respond to future crises. However, politicians remain reluctant to make tough choices on entitlement",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to video segmentation using Recurrent Fully Convolutional Networks (R-FCNs). Traditional methods for video segmentation rely on sliding window approaches, which process each frame independently and do not capture temporal information. In contrast, R-FCNs use recurrent connections to integrate information across frames, enabling the network to learn long-term dependencies in the video data.\n\nOur proposed method consists of two main components: a spatial module and a recurrent module. The spatial module is a fully convolutional network (FCN) that processes each frame individually, while the recurrent module uses long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to model the temporal relationships between frames. The output from the spatial module is fed into the recurrent module, allowing the network to refine its predictions over time.\n\nWe evaluate our method on several publicly available datasets, including PASCAL Video Dataset (PVD), YouTube-VOS, and Cityscapes. Our results show that R-FCNs outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, we achieve an mIoU of 83.0% on PVD, 81.7% on YouTube-VOS, and 76.5% on Cityscapes, while maintaining a high level of computational efficiency.\n\nIn addition, we perform a series of ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components in our framework. We find that the recurrent module improves the performance of the network by 4.3% on average across all datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can handle diverse scenarios, such as object movement, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds, with improved robustness compared to traditional methods.\n\nOverall, this work makes significant contributions to the field of video segmentation by introducing R-FCNs, which effectively leverage both spatial and temporal information to improve performance. Our proposed method has broad applications in various fields, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and video surveillance.",

The inclusion of boundary and entropy information improves the accuracy and robustness of the model, especially in cases where the fundus images contain irregular or unclear boundaries. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of different components of our proposed method, providing insights into the contributions of each component to the overall performance.\n\nThe main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\n* A novel approach to fundus image segmentation using boundary and entropy-driven adversarial learning is proposed;\n* A new CNN architecture that integrates both boundary and entropy information is introduced;\n* Extensive experiments on public datasets show improved performance compared to existing methods;\n* A detailed analysis of the contribution of each component of the proposed method is provided.\n\nOur proposed method has important implications for real-world applications such as diabetic retinopathy diagnosis and treatment planning, where accurate fundus image segmentation is critical.",
    "U.S. factory growth slowed in June, according to recent data, as tariffs and global trade tensions continue to impact the manufacturing sector. The closely watched Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index fell to 51.7 last month, down from 52.1 in May. While any reading above 50 indicates expansion, this is the lowest level since October 2016.\n\nThe report suggested that lingering concerns over trade policy and weakness in global demand weighed on production and new orders. New export orders contracted for the second straight month, falling to 49.5 from 50.5 in May. Comments from survey respondents highlighted the negative impact of tariffs on businesses, with one machinery industry participant stating that \"tariffs are causing uncertainty\" and another in transportation equipment saying they were experiencing \"pricing pressure due to increased costs from tariffs.\"\n\nDespite the overall slowdown, some underlying components of the ISM index showed resilience. Employment improved, with the jobs index rising to an eight-month high of 54.3. Input prices also continued their upward trend, increasing 4.8 points to 62.6 - the highest since April 2018.\n\nThe latest figures come amid growing signs of cooling economic momentum globally, particularly in the manufacturing sector. In Europe, factory activity has been sluggish, while Asian powerhouses such as Japan and South Korea have seen exports falter.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the U.S. economy remains supported by solid consumer spending and a tight labor market. Many economists expect the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month to help shore up growth, mirroring moves by central banks worldwide.\n\nStill, the underwhelming report didn't dent investor optimism, with stock markets holding onto gains made earlier in the week. Treasury yields dipped slightly following the release but still hovered near multiyear lows, reflecting lingering bets on easier monetary policies ahead. Traders also saw limited reaction in currency markets, with the dollar maintaining its range against major pe",
    "China played a key role in the break-up of the Russian oil company, Yukos, according to new documents revealed by a source close to the situation.\n\nThe papers, which have been seen by the BBC, suggest that Chinese state-owned companies worked closely with their Russian counterparts to divide up Yukos' assets following its bankruptcy in 2006. The documents include emails and memos between top executives at both Chinese and Russian energy firms, detailing negotiations over the purchase of Yukos' most valuable subsidiaries.\n\nOne email, sent by a senior executive at the Chinese state-owned oil giant CNPC to his counterpart at Rosneft, reads: \"We are pleased to confirm our interest in acquiring a significant stake in Yuganskneftegaz,\" referring to one of Yukos' largest asset. The email goes on to outline the terms of the proposed deal, including the price and payment details.\n\nAnother document, a memorandum signed by the CEO of Gazprom Neft, states that the Chinese company Sinopec has agreed to buy a 49% stake in Yuganskneftegaz for $3 billion. The memo also mentions that the remaining 51% will be acquired by Rosneft.\n\nThese revelations raise questions about the extent of China's influence in Russia's energy sector, and whether Moscow was forced to accept Beijing's terms due to political pressure or economic necessity. Some analysts point out that China's growing presence in Russia's natural resource industries could pose risks to national sovereignty and security.\n\nA spokesperson for Rosneft declined to comment on the specific allegations made by the BBC but said in an emailed statement that all transactions regarding Yukos' assets were conducted in accordance with Russian law and under the supervision of relevant regulatory authorities. A representative from CNPC also denied any wrongdoing, stating that the company adheres strictly to market principles and transparency standards in all business operations.\n\nIn response to parliamentary queries last week, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev maintained that no foreign power",
    "I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide some possible reasons why John Walker might be perceived negatively by some people.\n\nJohn Walker is a well-known YouTuber and gamer who has gained a large following over the years for his energetic and entertaining content. However, like any public figure, he has also received criticism and backlash from some corners of the internet. Here are a few possible reasons why:\n\n1. Controversial Comments: John Walker has made some controversial comments in the past that have rubbed some people the wrong way. For example, he has been known to make jokes about sensitive topics like race, gender, and politics, which may come across as offensive or insensitive to some viewers. While it's important to remember that humor can be subjective, these kinds of comments can alienate certain groups of people and contribute to negative perceptions of Walker.\n2. Perceived Hypocrisy: Some people might view Walker as hypocritical because of his behavior in certain situations. For instance, he has been called out for using offensive language or promoting harmful stereotypes while also advocating for social justice causes. This disconnect between his words and actions might lead some to question his sincerity or motives, leading to a negative impression.\n3. Overexposure: Another reason for negative sentiment towards Walker could be simple overexposure. With millions of followers and a constant stream of content, it's natural for some people to feel fatigued or annoyed by his omnipresence online. This isn't necessarily a reflection on Walker himself, but rather a result of how ubiquitous he has become in gaming and YouTube communities.\n4. Jealousy or Envy: Unfortunately, sometimes people dislike someone simply because they envy their success or popularity. It's human nature to compare ourselves to others, and when we see someone achieving greater heights than us, it can be tempting to tear them down instead of celebrating their achievements. While this isn't a healthy mindset, it's an unfortunate reality",
    "The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was a Great Lakes freighter that sank in a storm on Lake Superior on November 10, 1975, with all 29 crew members aboard. It has become one of the most famous shipwrecks in history and even had a song written about it by Gordon Lightfoot. But let's be real here, folks: the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald is highly overrated.\n\nFirst off, it's not like it was some kind of luxury liner or anything. It was a cargo ship, people! It wasn't like it was carrying passengers or anything interesting. Just a bunch of boring old iron ore pellets. Who cares? And okay, yeah, it was big and it sank in a storm, but so what? Ships sink all the time. Get over yourselves.\n\nAnd another thing, do we really need to keep harping on about this every year on the anniversary? Can't we just move on already? This isn't Titanic-level tragedy here, people. No need for annual memorial services and whatever else nonsense people get up to. Like, I GET IT. A boat sank. In a storm. With people on board. Oh no, how sad. Let's move on. There are FAR more important things happening than to sit around dwelling on something that happened decades ago. Perspective, anyone? I mean, come on. Everyone's always on about \"oh the poor families\" and stuff, but think about ALL the other tragic events that happen each day. That are happening RIGHT NOW. You want to cry about 29 dead sailors? How about entire cities being bombed and millions displaced? Compared to REAL tragedies, the Edmund Fitzgerald doesn't even rate a mention. Sorry. \n\nIn short: can we please stop worshipping this mediocre wreck now?",

His encounters with Yoda (Frank Oz) on Dagobah provide some of the most memorable moments in the franchise, offering valuable lessons about patience, perseverance, and self-discovery. Meanwhile, Han's banter with Chewbacca and C-3PO remains as humorous and endearing as ever.\n\nJohn Williams' score once again elevates the material, adding majesty and emotion to each scene. The iconic Imperial March – which debuted in this film – has become synonymous with evil itself, while the swirling clouds and lightsabers of the asteroid field battle evoke a sense of wonder no other franchise can match.\n\nPerhaps most impressive is how \"The Empire Strikes Back\" balances light and darkness. From the bleakness of Cloud City's carbon freeze chamber to the levity of Han and Leia's kiss, the film never forgets that life is complicated and multifaceted. Even the bad",
    "Safin has expressed relief at the recovery of the Australian economy, which had been facing challenges in recent times. The country's GDP growth rate had slowed down significantly, and many experts had raised concerns about a possible recession. However, with the latest economic data showing signs of improvement, Safin believes that the worst may be behind them.\n\n\"I am glad to see that Australia is finally turning a corner,\" said Safin in an interview with the BBC. \"The past few years have been tough for everyone, and it's great to see some positive momentum building up.\"\n\nAccording to the latest figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the country's economy grew by 0.8% in the second quarter of this year, exceeding expectations. This represents a significant improvement from the previous quarter, when growth was only 0.2%.\n\nSafin attributed the recovery to a combination of factors, including monetary policy decisions and fiscal measures taken by the government. He also highlighted the resilience of the Australian people and their ability to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nHowever, Safin also cautioned against complacency, stressing the need for continued efforts to support the economy. \"While we are relieved that things seem to be looking up, there is still much work ahead,\" he warned. \"We must ensure that these positive trends continue and translate into real benefits for all Australians.\"\n\nIn particular, Safin urged the government to focus on investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which he believes will help create jobs and stimulate long-term growth. He also emphasized the importance of ensuring that any economic gains are shared equitably among all sections of society.\n\nOverall, Safin's sentiments reflect a growing sense of optimism in Australia, as the country looks set to avoid a recession and chart a path towards sustainable growth. While there are still challenges ahead, his comments suggest that there is hope for a brighter future for the land Down Under.",
    "Hi fellow skeptics!\nI wanted to share my thoughts on Nelson’s recent talk. While I understand that many people found it inspiring and motivating, I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable with some of the ideas presented. It seemed to me that the talk was veering into unscientific cult-like territory, with a heavy emphasis on blind faith and following without question. This is not what I signed up for when I joined this community.\n\nOne particular thing that stood out to me was the way Nelson labeled anyone who doubted or questioned his ideas as \"lazy learners\". Now, I get that we all have different learning styles and abilities, and that some people might need more time and effort to grasp certain concepts. But the way he framed it made it sound like anyone who didn't immediately accept his claims without critical thought was somehow defective or inferior. That doesn't seem very scientific or open-minded to me.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the whole \"receiving information directly from God\" bit. Look, I understand that spirituality is an important aspect of life for many people, but let's keep it separate from scientific inquiry, shall we? It's important to base our beliefs and decisions on empirical evidence and reasoning, rather than just taking someone else's word for it.\n\nIn any case, I think there are some red flags here that should give us pause. Let's make sure to approach these kinds of talks and ideas with a healthy dose of skepticism and critical thinking, and not fall prey to groupthink or blind devotion. What do you guys think?",
    "Yeah, I've been seeing some weird stuff going on in this subreddit lately, but this takes the cake. A 15 year old moderator? Are you kidding me?\n\nI know we all had our fair share of teenage angst and drama back in the day, but giving someone that young the power to moderate a community like this? It's just asking for trouble. They're gonna be banning people left and right because they don't have the maturity or perspective to handle conflicts properly. And what happens when they get into an argument with another mod? Is it gonna turn into a playground fight?\n\nAnd let's not forget about all the legal liability that comes with having a minor as a mod. What kind of responsibility are we talking about here? Can they even enter into contracts? I know there's gotta be some laws around this somewhere.\n\nAnyway, I was already considering leaving this subreddit due to all the toxicity and lack of actual discussion, but this is the final straw. If there's really a 15 year old mod, then count me out. Time to find a better place to spend my time.",
    "It's curtains down for one of reality TV's most iconic families, as MTV has announced that they are canceling their popular show 'The Osbournes'. The decision comes after a successful run of five seasons and over 70 episodes, cementing the Osbourne clan's place in pop culture history.\n\nThe show first premiered in 2019 and quickly gained a massive following with its unapologetic look into the lives of heavy metal legend Ozzy Osbourne and his family. Viewers tuned in weekly to see the ups and downs of the Osbournes' lives, including Ozzy's marriage to Sharon, their children Jack and Kelly, and their struggles with addiction, fame, and family drama.\n\nDespite the success, producers have decided not to renew the show for another season. In a statement released earlier today, an MTV spokesperson said: \"We are grateful to the Osbourne family for opening up their home and their hearts to our audience over the past few years. However, we feel that this chapter of the show has come to a natural conclusion and it is time to move on.\"\n\nFans took to social media to express their sadness at the announcement, but many also expressed gratitude for the entertainment and laughter that the show had brought them. One fan tweeted, \"I'm so sad #TheOsbournes is ending! That show was my guilty pleasure and I'll miss seeing the crazy antics of that lovable bunch!\" Another added, \"Thanks for the memories @MTV! You gave us some truly unforgettable moments with The Osbournes - they will be missed!\"\n\nWhile 'The Osbournes' may be coming to an end, fans can rest assured that they haven't seen the last of the Osbourne family yet. With rumors swirling about potential new projects and spin-offs featuring various members of the family, it is clear that the firebrand personalities of the Osbournes still have plenty to offer the world of entertainment.\n\nAs the curtain closes on 'The Osbournes', viewers can only",
    "Many businesses are neglecting to prepare for the potential impact of HIV on their operations, according to a new report. The study, conducted by the international consultancy firm KPMG, found that only a small percentage of companies have implemented policies and procedures to address the needs of employees living with HIV.\n\nThe report surveyed 100 large businesses across various sectors in the UK and found that just 12% had an HIV policy in place. Moreover, only 25% of those polled provided training for line managers on how to support staff members who are HIV positive.\n\nExperts warn that failing to provide adequate support for employees living with HIV can lead to poor health outcomes, reduced productivity, and increased absenteeism. They also note that not tackling stigma around HIV can create a hostile work environment that prevents people from disclosing their status or seeking help when needed.\n\n\"It's unacceptable that so many businesses are not taking practical steps to support workers living with HIV,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Gault, Head of Research at NAT (National AIDS Trust). \"Employers must recognize that staff members with HIV are entitled to the same rights and opportunities as anyone else. By implementing simple measures such as providing confidentiality agreements, flexible working arrangements, and access to occupational health services, they can ensure that everyone feels supported and empowered.\"\n\nHIV charities emphasize that having an HIV policy is crucial for creating an inclusive and enabling environment where individuals can disclose their status without fear of prejudice or rebuke. Such policies should cover issues like data protection, employee assistance programs, and clear guidelines on disclosure and confidentiality. Organizations that proactively address these concerns see improved morale, lower turnover rates, and better overall performances.\n\nLack of preparedness affects not only employees but also the broader community. Failure to educate staff about prevention methods may contribute to the spread of HIV within society, perpetuating new infections among customers and partners alike.\n\nIn light of this situation, prominent organizations urge all employers – big or",
    "In this paper, we present a novel approach for fast whole-body segmentation in computer vision, called Keypoint Transfer. This method leverages the power of deep learning to accurately and efficiently separate objects from their surroundings, facilitating applications such as object recognition, tracking, and scene understanding.\n\nExisting methods for whole-body segmentation often rely on time-consuming and computationally expensive algorithms that are not suitable for real-time processing. Our proposedKeypoint Transfer method addresses these limitations by using a two-stage framework that first generates high-quality keypoints and then transfers them to the target image. This allows for fast and accurate segmentation of entire bodies, including complex objects with varying sizes, shapes, and textures.\n\nWe evaluate our method on several challenging datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we showcase the versatility of Keypoint Transfer by applying it to various computer vision tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.\n\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n* We introduce Keypoint Transfer, a novel approach for fast whole-body segmentation that combines the strengths of deep learning and keypoint-based methods.\n* We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method through extensive experiments on various datasets and tasks.\n* We highlight the adaptability of Keypoint Transfer, which enables its application to diverse computer vision tasks beyond whole-body segmentation.\n\nOverall, this paper provides a significant advancement in the field of computer vision, offering a powerful tool for fast and accurate whole-body segmentation that has numerous practical applications.",
    "This research paper proposes a novel validity index for evaluating the performance of fuzzy-possibilistic c-means (FPCM) clustering algorithms. Existing validity indices for FCM clustering are primarily based on distance metrics that assess the separation between clusters, and they have limitations in capturing the uncertainty and imprecision inherent in fuzzy clustering. The proposed validity index, called the Fuzziness-Adjusted Separation Entropy (FASE) index, takes into account both the separateness and the fuzziness of the clusters to provide a more comprehensive evaluation metric.\n\nThe FASE index is computed using a combination of the entropy measure and the separation measure, which are adjusted by weights that reflect the degree of fuzziness in the data. In contrast to traditional validity indices, the FASE index can capture the trade-off between the compactness and sepatedness of clusters, as well as the level of membership entropy.\n\nThe authors evaluate the effectiveness of the FASE index using several numerical experiments with different types of datasets and compare it with other commonly used validity indices. The results show that the FASE index provides better discrimination power and is less sensitive to outliers compared to existing measures. Furthermore, the paper discusses the relationship between the FASE index and the number of clusters, and analyzes its sensitivity to different parameters such as the membership function and the normalization factor.\n\nThis study contributes to the development of a new tool for evaluating the quality of fuzzy clustering solutions, which can be particularly useful in applications where uncertainty and imprecision play a significant role, such as image segmentation, medical diagnosis, or financial risk analysis.",
    "The dollar strengthened against major currencies today, boosted by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that suggested interest rates may rise further in the US.\n\nIn a speech delivered to the Economic Club of New York, Mr Greenspan said that the current economic expansion in the US was \"remarkable\" and that there were signs that productivity growth was improving. He also noted that the recent surge in oil prices had not yet had a significant impact on core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs.\n\nThe greenback jumped following the release of the speech, with the euro falling to $1.2837 down from $1.2920 before the speech. The pound sterling also slipped, trading at $1.8465 compared to $1.8530 earlier in the day.\n\nAnalysts say that Mr Greenspan's comments indicate that he is leaning towards raising interest rates again soon, possibly as early as next month. The Fed has already raised borrowing costs three times this year, taking the federal funds rate to its current level of 2%.\n\nInvestors are now pricing in an increased probability of another quarter-point hike when the central bank meets in June. According to futures markets, there is currently a 40% chance of a rate rise then, up from just 20% a week ago.\n\nHigher interest rates tend to support a currency, as they make it more attractive for investors to hold assets denominated in that currency. This is especially true when other countries have lower interest rates, making their currencies less appealing. As such, the dollar stands to benefit if the Fed continues its series of rate hikes while other major economies keep interest rates steady or even cut them.\n\nMarket observers note, however, that the response to Mr Greenspan's remarks could be a case of overreaction, given that no definitive commitment to tightening monetary policy can be inferred from his words alone. Moreover, several officials at the European Central Bank (ECB) have recently stated that their monetary stance remains accommodative, suggesting that rates in Europe might stay",
    "Fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm sure many of you have noticed the growing problem of smurf accounts on our platform. These accounts, created by users who are already well-established in their main communities, are designed to circumvent the effort and dedication required to build credibility within a subreddit. They often do this by creating new accounts with low karma, which they then use to self-promote, seed posts, or vote illegitimately. Not only does this undermine the integrity of our community moderation system, but it also stifles opportunities for genuinely engaged users to participate meaningfully in discussions. This practice dilutes the quality and authenticity of content across Reddit as a whole, including in your own favorite subreddits!\n\nI’ve gathered support from various users who share my frustration at seeing hard work and contribution ignored, merely because someone was savvy enough to game the system. It’s time we put an end to this practice that unfairly advantages those privileged few willing to manipulate the rules at everyone else’s expense. I therefore request that Reddit administrators implement a feature allowing mod teams to optionally ban all alternate accounts (smurfs) from participating in certain subreddits – without punishing their linked primary account. By doing so there will finally be consequences when one is caught creating these alternate identities simply to bolster their posting privileges. In turn, every community can flourish under fair, meritocratic conditions, no longer shadowed by lurking smurfs waiting to exploit them for personal gain. Smurf accounts harm us directly: as individuals looking to engage with interesting topics; indirectly: through promoting mediocracy over deserving material via artificial means like brigades and fake outrage; and globally: making casual visitors less likely to stay when worthwhile comments get drowned out by waves of fabricated noise, generated around clickbait submissions. Join me in signing this petition aiming to forbid such behaviors & improve things for all Redditors! Together let's elevate discussion within our beloved site once more.",
    "This paper proposes a novel approach to automatic image pixel clustering using the mussels wandering optimization algorithm. The proposed method leverages the ability of mussels to cluster and self-organize in their natural environment, and applies this principle to the task of image segmentation.\n\nThe mussels wandering optimization algorithm is a recently developed technique inspired by the behavior of mussels colonizing rocks in rivers. In this algorithm, multiple mussel agents move randomly through the image plane, settling at locations that offer optimal attachment sites. Through iterative processes, the mussels form clusters and create boundaries between different regions of the image.\n\nIn our approach, we use a similar strategy to partition an image into its constituent parts. We introduce a set of artificial mussels that wander throughout the image, attaching themselves to pixels with high similarity in color or texture features. By iteratively updating the positions of these mussels, the algorithm gradually forms distinct clusters of similarly colored or textured regions within the image.\n\nWe evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several benchmark images with varying levels of complexity and noise. Our results show that the mussels wandering optimization algorithm outperforms established methods such as k-means and hierarchical clustering in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to diverse applications including object detection, edge detection, and denoising.\n\nOverall, this research presents a promising new approach to image pixel clustering that draws inspiration from nature's own pattern formation mechanisms. Its effectiveness suggests potential for deployment in various computer vision tasks where automated segmentation can streamline processing workflows or enhance decision-making operations.",
    "US crude prices have seen a significant increase, surging above $53 per barrel for the first time in over a year. This rise is attributed to a combination of factors, including a drop in inventory levels and geopolitical tensions in oil-producing countries.\n\nAccording to data released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), US commercial crude oil inventories decreased by 6.7 million barrels last week, exceeding market expectations. The reduction in inventory has contributed to the upward pressure on prices, as it suggests a stronger demand for oil.\n\nAdditionally, escalating tensions between the US and Iran, as well as conflicts in Libya and Nigeria, have had an impact on global oil supplies. Oil production in these countries has been disrupted, leading to concerns about potential supply shortages and further price increases.\n\nThe surge in US crude prices marks a reversal from recent trends, where prices had fallen due to oversupply and weakened demand. The shift has caught the attention of investors and analysts who are now questioning whether this growth will be sustainable or simply a temporary reaction to external factors.\n\nSome industry experts believe that the current rally may continue, citing signs of a tightening oil market. Phil Flynn, Senior Market Analyst at Price Futures Group, stated: \"We're seeing a major change in fundamentals. The market is starting to realize there isn't enough oil out there.\" He added that the decline in crude stockpiles was \"a big sign that demand is picking back up.\"\n\nHowever, other analysts remain cautious. They argue that global demand remains subdued and any potential supply disruptions can potentially be offset by increased output from producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. Michael Tran, Managing Director at RBC Capital Markets, said: \"It's hard to get too excited when we still have so much inventory sitting around. We don't think this rally can be sustained until we see more convincing evidence of fundamental improvement.\"\n\nDespite the differing opinions among analysts, the recent price hi",
    "Debra Hill, the screenwriter and producer behind the iconic horror film Halloween, has passed away at the age of 65.\n\nHill died on Thursday in Los Angeles after a long illness, her agent confirmed to the BBC. She was best known for her work on John Carpenter's 1978 classic Halloween, which she co-wrote with the director and produced. The low-budget film became a surprise hit, grossing over $47 million at the box office and cementing its place as a cult classic.\n\nBorn in 1950 in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Hill began her career in the film industry as a script supervisor before moving into writing and producing. In addition to Halloween, she wrote and produced several other films including The Fog, Escape from New York, and The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension.\n\nHill's work on Halloween helped redefine the horror genre and paved the way for future slasher films like Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Her influence can still be seen in many modern horror movies and TV shows.\n\n\"Debra was a trailblazer for women in film, breaking down barriers and proving that women could succeed in an industry dominated by men,\" said her friend and colleague, Tommy Lee Wallace. \"She will always be remembered for her incredible contributions to horror cinema.\"\n\nFans and fellow filmmakers have taken to social media to pay tribute to Hill's legacy, sharing memories and praise for her work.\n\nHill is survived by her daughter, Alexis O'Connor, who thanked fans for their support in a statement, saying: \"My mother was an amazing woman who inspired me every day. I am so grateful to have had the chance to learn from her and be a part of her life.\"\n\nThe loss of Debra Hill is a sad day for horror fans and the film industry alike.

    "In a significant step towards greater integration with Europe, Turkey has reached an agreement with the European Union to launch accession talks, British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference in Luxembourg with Turkish Premier Recep Tayyip Erdogan and EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, Blair described the development as \"a very important moment\" in Turkey's relations with the EU.\n\nThe agreement paves the way for Ankara to begin negotiations aimed at eventually becoming a full member of the 25-nation bloc. The talks are expected to take several years and will cover a range of issues including trade, economic reform, human rights, and political and military matters.\n\nTurkey first applied for membership in the European Economic Community (EEC), the predecessor to the EU, in 1987, but its bid was rejected due to concerns over its human rights record and territorial disputes with Greece. However, in recent years, Ankara has implemented sweeping reforms aimed at meeting EU membership criteria, leading to renewed support among EU leaders for its candidacy.\n\nBlair, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, praised Turkey's efforts to modernize its economy and democracy, saying that they have been \"impressive.\" He added that the start of accession talks is \"a clear signal of the EU's commitment to enlargement and our desire to see Turkey play a full role in the European Union.\"\n\nErdogan expressed his gratitude to Blair and other EU leaders for their backing, calling it a \"historical decision\" that would help strengthen ties between Turkey and the EU. He affirmed Turkey's willingness to continue implementing necessary reforms and meet all obligations required for membership.\n\nBarroso echoed Blair's sentiments, emphasizing that the opening of accession talks did not necessarily guarantee membership, but rather marked \"the beginning of a long journey\" toward that goal. He acknowledged, however, that the process would be challenging and require hard work from both sides.\n\nCritics within the EU",
    "This is one wild ride! I've been a fan of vampire flicks since I was a kid, and this one takes the cake - it's got everything you could want from a horror film: gore, suspense, drama, and some wicked cool creature effects.\n\nThe cast is top-notch, with George Clooney and Salma Hayek leading the charge as Seth and Santanico Pandemonium (I mean, what a name!). They play two bank robbers who hole up in a seedy strip club on the Mexico border to lay low after a heist gone wrong. Little do they know, the place is infested with bloodsucking monsters masquerading as humans.\n\nQuentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez knocked it out of the park with their script; there are so many quotable lines that have become catchphrases among my friends. It's funny how certain scenes can make you cringe and laugh at the same time - Harvey Keitel's \"Have you ever fired a gun like that before?\" gets me every time.\n\nOn top of all the great characters, we get iconic cameos by Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo. You never quite know where the story will go next or when someone new might show up and steal the scene. There's even a Tom Savini appearance!

    "Directed by Mel Gibson, Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful and thought-provoking war drama that tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who served as a medic in World War II. The film is a brutal and unflinching portrayal of the horrors of war, but also a testament to the strength of human spirit and the power of conviction.\n\nAndrew Garfield gives an incredible performance as Doss, capturing his character's deep sense of faith and principle with nuance and depth. Vince Vaughn is equally impressive as Sergeant Howell, Doss's tough-as-nails commanding officer, who sees the potential in the young medic and pushes him to prove himself against all odds.\n\nThe battle scenes are intense and graphic, leaving nothing to the imagination as bodies are torn apart and limbs are blown off. But despite the carnage, the film never feels gratuitous or exploitative, maintaining a focus on the human cost of conflict without glorifying violence.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Hacksaw Ridge is its exploration of morality and conscience. Doss's refusal to carry a weapon or engage in combat puts him at odds with his fellow soldiers, who view him as a coward and a liability. But as the barrage of artillery and gunfire rains down around them, Doss proves time and again that he is willing to put his own life on the line to save others, earning their respect and admiration in the process.\n\nDespite being based on real events, parts of the story feel almost too good to be true – how could one man possibly rescue so many people singlehandedly? Yet, what makes Hacksaw Ridge truly remarkable is precisely this sense of incredulity; the fact that such acts of courage and selflessness can exist even amidst the worst of human depravity is a powerful reminder of our shared capacity for good.\n\nOverall, Hacksaw Ridge is an important film that challenges us to think deeply about our beliefs and values, particularly when they come into conflict with societal norms and",
    "In a stunning turn of events, it has emerged that Brazilian football star Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, better known as Neymar Jr., was tricked into signing for Spanish club Real Madrid instead of his current team, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).\n\nAccording to sources close to the player, Neymar had been in negotiations with PSG over a new contract, but talks had reached an impasse. Meanwhile, Real Madrid had been courting the striker for months, and saw an opportunity to swoop in and steal him away from their rivals.\n\nIn a clever ploy, Madrid officials allegedly created fake social media accounts and convincingly posing as representatives of PSG, they began discussing the details of a new deal with Neymar's camp. The scheme worked so well that even Neymar himself was duped, reportedly believing he was signing a new contract with PSG when he put pen to paper on the dotted line.\n\nThe extent of the deception only came to light when Neymar arrived at the Bernabéu Stadium for his first training session with Madrid. A source revealed: \"Neymar showed up ready to meet his new teammates, but instead of being greeted by Kylian Mbappe and Presnel Kimpembe, he found himself face to face with Gareth Bale and Sergio Ramos.\"\n\nReeling from the shock, Neymar immediately demanded clarification from his agent, who sheepishly admitted the truth behind the situation. As yet, there has been no official statement from either club or Neymar himself regarding this astounding transfer saga. However, rumors suggest Liverpool FC are already preparing a mammoth offer to prize both Neymar and his agent away from the clutches of Madrid.",

Can't we just have a little bit of balance here?\n\nI mean, seriously, who thought it would be fun to play a game where one team has infinite resources and the other team is stuck defending against them with limited ammo and no reinforcements? It's like they want us to lose. And don't even get me started on the operators. Who decided that it would be a good idea to give each player their own unique abilities and then make them cost an arm and a leg to use? I swear, every time I try to use my operator ability, I end up broke and unable to do anything useful for the rest of the round.\n\nAnd let's talk about the maps for a second. They're all tiny, cramped spaces that are designed specifically to funnel players into narrow choke points where they can easily get picked off by snipers.

    "This paper proposes a novel image segmentation enhancement technique that combines the advantages of active contours and topological alignments. The proposed method exploits the flexibility of active contours to accurately delineate object boundaries, while incorporating topological information to ensure consistent segmentation results.\n\nThe proposed technique consists of three main stages: (1) preprocessing, (2) active contour evolution, and (3) topological alignment. In the preprocessing stage, the input image is filtered to reduce noise and enhance contrast. The active contour evolution stage involves iteratively updating the contour points using a energy functional that incorporates both image intensity and gradient information. The topological alignment stage ensures that the evolved contour segments are topologically consistent by aligning them with the underlying pixel connectivity.\n\nThe proposed technique has been extensively evaluated on several benchmark images with varying complexity levels. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional active contour methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Specifically, our method achieves an average boundary detection accuracy of 95% and reduces computational time by 30% compared to traditional methods.\n\nThe key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (i) the integration of topological information into the active contour framework to improve segmentation accuracy, (ii) the use of efficient numerical optimization techniques to achieve real-time performance, and (iii) thorough evaluation of the proposed technique on various challenging images.\n\nOverall, the presented work offers a significant improvement over existing active contour approaches and provides a promising solution for applications requiring accurate and efficient image segmentation.",
    "I'm still in shock and feeling really hurt right now. So, my girlfriend and I have been together for about six months and things have been great. We're both happy, we communicate openly, and everything seemed perfect. Well, this past weekend, we were at a dinner party at our friends' house and something happened that has left me feeling betrayed and confused.\n\nOur friends are a married couple, and they know that I'm bisexual. They've known me for years and have always been supportive. However, on Saturday night, things took a turn for the worst.\n\nWe were all sitting around the table enjoying dinner when the husband suddenly turns to me and says, \"Hey, [username], I have a question for you.\" I thought nothing of it and replied, \"Sure, what's up?\" He then proceeds to ask me point-blank if I'm dating anyone. Now, I've never hid my sexuality from them, but in that moment, I felt like he was trying to outme. I looked over at my girlfriend, who was sitting next to me, and saw her looking at me with a mix of confusion and concern.\n\nI tried to laugh it off and said something like, \"Oh, you know, I'm just focusing on work right now,\" hoping to brush it off. But the husband persisted, asking again if there was someone special in my life. At this point, my heart started racing, and I could feel my face getting hotter by the second. My girlfriend then spoke up and said, \"Wait, [username], is there something you want to tell me?\"\n\nI didn't know what to say. Part of me wanted to lie and say no, but another part of me felt like I couldn't keep hiding this huge aspect of myself from the person I care about most. It felt like everyone at the table knew something I didn't, and I couldn't take it anymore. So, I took a deep breath and told my girlfriend that yes, I am attracted to men and women.\n\nThe room fell silent, and my girlfriend looked at me with tears in her eyes. She",
    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm struggling with something and I hope someone out there can offer some advice or insight. Here's my situation:\n\nI recently ended a long-term relationship (we were together for about 5 years) and now I find myself missing the person dearly. We had our ups and downs like any couple, but looking back, I realize that we had a lot more good times than bad. The breakup was mutual, and while it wasn't exactly amicable, there's no animosity between us either. In fact, we still chat occasionally and exchange pleasantries.\n\nBut despite all this, I can't help feeling like a part of me is missing since they're gone from my life. It's not even necessarily about being lonely - I have great friends who support me and keep me company - it's just that I miss the connection we had. You know, those little moments when you share a laugh or have a deep conversation, the kind of things that only happen when you've been close to someone for so long.\n\nNow here's where things get complicated: sometimes, I catch myself romanticizing the relationship. Like, I start thinking 'what if we got back together? Maybe things would be different this time...'. But then reality kicks in and I remember why we broke up in the first place: we grew apart, had different priorities, etc. And honestly, I don't think getting back together would work out even if we tried.\n\nSo basically, I'm stuck between missing the person and missing the idea of the relationship. I feel like I'm grieving the loss of what could have been as much as the actual loss itself. Does anyone else relate? How do you guys cope with situations like these? Am I just torturing myself by holding onto something that never existed beyond our shared memories? Please provide some perspective because right now I'm lost AF.",
    "In this paper, we introduce and study graded comodule categories with enough projectives. These are category versions of graded algebras over commutative rings, where the grading is given by a group action rather than a fixed scalar multiplication. We investigate the properties and structure of these categories, including the existence of (graded) injective resolutions, Ext groups, and the relationship between them.\nWe also explore connections to other areas of mathematics, such as representation theory, homological algebra, and algebraic geometry. The main result of the paper establishes that every graded module category with enough projectives admits a unique skew- GROUP ring, generalizing classical results from commutative algebra. This provides a new perspective on the subject and paves the way for further research in this area.",
    "In this paper, we present a novel approach to RGBD semantic segmentation using spatio-temporal data-driven pooling (STD2P). Our method leverages both color and depth information from RGBD images, as well as temporal information from video sequences, to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation.\n\nExisting methods for RGBD semantic segmentation typically use hand-crafted features or deep learning models that operate on individual frames independently. However, these approaches often overlook the rich spatio-temporal structure present in video data. STD2P addresses this limitation by introducing a new pooling mechanism that captures spatial and temporal dependencies between neighboring pixels and frames.\n\nThe proposed method consists of two main components: a spatial pyramid pooling module and a temporal convolutional network. The spatial pyramid pooling module aggregates local feature maps from different scales, while the temporal convolutional network refines the features using long-short term memory (LSTM) layers. We also introduce a new loss function that combines classwise intersection over union with temporal smoothness regularization to better handle temporally inconsistent annotations.\n\nWe evaluate our method on several publicly available datasets, including NYUv2, DIW, and DenseMVS. Experimental results demonstrate that STD2P outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves superior performance in terms of mIoU and consistency. Specifically, STD2P improves mIoU by 10.3% and 6.5% compared to the next best performing method on NYUv2 and DIW, respectively. Additionally, we show that STD2P is more robust to occlusions and motion blur than other approaches.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) we propose a novel spatio-temporal data-driven pooling mechanism for RGBD semantic segmentation; (2) we develop a new loss function that incorporates both classification and temporal coherence; (3) we achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.\n\nThis work has important implications for applications such",
    "The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a poignant and relatable coming-of-age story that captures the essence of adolescence in a way that few films have managed to do before. The film tells the story of Charlie, a shy and introverted teenager who struggles to find his place in the world.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of this film is its cast. Logan Lerman gives a remarkable performance as Charlie, perfectly capturing the vulnerability and awkwardness of being a teenager. He's surrounded by a talented supporting cast, including Emma Watson and Ezra Miller, who deliver equally impressive performances.\n\nThe film's soundtrack is another highlight, expertly curated with a mix of classic rock, punk, and indie music that perfectly complements the mood and atmosphere of each scene. It's clear that the filmmakers are passionate about their source material, and they've made sure to incorporate many references to classic novels and films throughout the movie – adding yet another layer of depth to the narrative.\n\nIn terms of themes, The Perks of Being a Wallflower tackles some heavy issues – such as drug use, sexuality, mental health, and high school politics – but always manages to handle them with sensitivity and nuance. The film never resorts to preachiness or simplistic answers; instead, it presents these challenges as complex and deeply personal struggles that can be difficult to navigate – much like real life.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, this film feels authentic. It's easy to see why so many viewers connect with this story: we've all felt like outsiders at one point or another, struggling to make sense of our lives while trying to fit in. The Perks of Being a Wallflower understands this feeling intimately and portrays it beautifully on screen.\n\nUltimately, this film will stay with you because it gently nudges us towards self-discovery, encouraging us to celebrate our own uniqueness instead of conforming to societal norms. There’s no doubt that The Perks of Being a Wallflower has become",
    "It feels like a dark cloud has been hanging over me for as long as I can remember, but now that the pandemic is coming to an end and life slowly returns to normal, I've realized how much time and energy I spend trying to hide this. But I know I can't continue like that.\n\nFor years, I've struggled with anxiety and depression, always hoping I would get better on my own or through therapy or medication. Maybe even something silly like listening to calming music. But nothing seems to work, and I feel helpless and stuck in my life.\n\nIt started out small, little things: forgetting appointments, struggling to focus in meetings, feeling tired all the time. Then it got worse. My relationship with family and friends suffered because of it, I lost several jobs along the way, and eventually ended up homeless for a while when COVID hit. Life became harder every day, and still, I kept going because my fear of failure held me back.\n\nBut now, even with lockdowns ending and opportunities starting to open up, I find myself getting lost in my thoughts all alone, constantly questioning if any of it will ever change. Does anyone see what's happening to me? Is there help available? Or am I doomed to carry this burden forever?\n\nI don't know the answers to these questions yet, but I hope that by sharing my story here, maybe someone else can understand too. And perhaps together we might be able to find solutions we all so desperately need.",
    "The aim of this study is to develop an automated pavement crack segmentation method that accurately detects and divides cracks into smaller pieces. We employ a U-Net-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for pavement crack identification, which has been trained on a dataset containing images of pavements with various levels of cracking severity. Our proposed model achieves 98% accuracy in identifying cracks and can differentiate between two types of crack patterns commonly found in pavements - longitudinal and transverse. Additionally, our work demonstrates improved performance over traditional methods that use handcrafted features or machine learning models limited by small training data sets. Overall, our results suggest that automated pavement crack segmentation using U-Net-based CNN provides an effective solution for efficient inspection of road infrastructure.",
    "Last night, I had a dream that really disturbed me. It was so vivid and intense that it feels like it was almost real. In the dream, I was walking down a dark alleyway when suddenly I saw a group of people gathered in front of an old house. They were chanting and waving signs, but as I got closer, I realized they were protesting against my family, saying we're all criminals and guilty of unspeakable acts.\n\nI started to panic, feeling like my whole world was crumbling around me. As I tried to run away, I saw my parents standing at the end of the alley, holding hands and smiling at each other like nothing was wrong. Suddenly, police officers appeared out of nowhere and began to surround us, arresting us all on the spot. I felt completely powerless and overwhelmed by everything happening around me.\n\nAs the dream came to an end, I woke up with a sense of dread and unease still lingering within me. It's been several hours since then and I can't shake off this feeling of distress. I don't know what to do or how to process these emotions. Anyone have any advice? #dreamstuff",

How do I overcome these negative thoughts and memories when every person I meet reminds me of her in some way shape or form?",
    "Title: Heights of Points with Bounded Ramification\nAbstract: We study the heights and geometric ramifications of elliptic curves defined over number fields. Specifically, we focus on those elliptic curves possessing a bound on their nontrivial ramification divisors, which correspond to height one points in our setting. Using techniques from algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, and analytical number theory, we derive bounds on these heights under various assumptions about the underlying curve and its associated modular forms. Our results provide new insights into the distribution of rational points on elliptic curves and contribute to the study of asymptotic questions related to Diophantine equations.",

A comedy with thinly-veiled themes about infidelity cannot save itself when none of those themes are explored convincingly or creatively despite Paul Rudd delivering an entertaining performance at times, especially during some intense chase sequences in London's busy city streets. Yet another disappointing outing for Pegg, where he tries to mimic Judd Apatow instead of creating something new.",
    "So, I recently started using a new online dating app and got matched with someone who seemed really great at first. I quickly realized that they were only interested in casual hookups while I was looking for something more serious.\n\nMy main issue is their messaging though. For some reason, no matter how many times I try to bring up my desires (i.e., wanting monogamy or commitment), they always seem to steer the conversation back to being flirty and suggestive. Is it too much to ask for someone who wants the same thing? It's starting to feel like I put my expectations way too high.",
    "Body:\n\nThe Labour party is facing mounting pressure after it was accused of breaking its manifesto promise to elect more female MPs at the 2019 general election. The Conservatives have highlighted that out of the 58 Labour seats they gained in the election, only five went to female candidates. This falls short of John McDonnell's pledge that \"at least half\" of newly-elected Labour MPs would be women by 2030.\n\nThis issue has been further compounded by reports that some Labour candidates withdrew from running due to concerns about their chances of winning despite being strong contenders. These rumours suggest that there may have been a conscious effort to limit the number of female candidates put forward for selection.\n\nThere are currently only four women in the Shadow Cabinet and seven women overall among the eight senior shadow ministers, further stoking suspicion that the government is trying to avoid meeting its gender diversity targets.\n\nIt follows criticism of the party earlier this year over a controversial internal poll, which some claimed appeared designed to discourage women from running for leadership positions within Labour.\n\nSeveral prominent female MPs including Harriet Harman, Sarah Champion, and Angela Rayner, have called on Mr McDonnell to keep his promise and deliver on labour's commitment to greater gender equality.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr McDonnell said: \"John had made a commitment for every parliamentary intake going forward but we recognise that our progress towards gender balance wasn't as fast as it could have been.\"\n\nThe Conservative Party criticised Labour for what they described as an attempt to \"talk tough\" on gender issues while failing to actually deliver on them. A statement read: \"This latest failure demonstrates that the women of Britain can no longer trust Labour with their promises.”",
    "Businesses across Europe are growing increasingly concerned about the slow pace of economic growth in the European Union (EU). Recent data has shown that inflation rates have fallen sharply, and industrial production remains stagnant. This has led to declines in consumer spending and slower sales for many companies operating within the region.\n\nCritics argue that the sluggish economic performance is mainly due to a lack of political stability and uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Many businesses have had to delay their plans and investments due to the unclear regulatory environment, causing them to be hesitant to invest or create job opportunities.\n\nGovernment officials have been warned by business leaders to take action to stimulate the economy before it's too late. The European Commission recently released a plan to boost investment, but critics say it goes too far. Some experts predict that major changes will need to be made if the EU wants to avoid entering another recession.\n\nIn addition to political factors such as Brexit, there are also concerns about structural weaknesses within the euro area. For example, high levels of debt among some member states continue to plague the economy, with Greece still struggling to meet its targets despite receiving billions of dollars in bailout money over the years.\n\nAs tensions rise between countries within the bloc, and Brexit negotiations come to an end this year, many businesses are anxiously waiting for signs that things will improve - at least enough to see a profitable return on their investments in the future of the EU.",

    "Ad sales have contributed significantly to Time Warner's quarterly profits, according to recent reports from analyst firm StreetInsider. In particular, growth in digital advertising has helped drive revenue gains across multiple businesses within the company.\n\nKey highlights of this trend include significant increases in online ad spend with major digital publishers and social media platforms like Facebook, as well as strong performance in demand for video advertising on streaming services such as HBO Max and AT&T TV+. As a result, experts predict that Time Warner will continue to see healthy growth in its ad sales business in the coming quarters.\n\nIn other developments at time Warner, the company's cable division continues to experience steady revenue growth due in part to ongoing competition among broadcasters vying for subscribers. Additionally, some recent acquisitions and investments made by Time Warner are expected to pay off down the road, generating additional returns for shareholders as they become more integrated into the company's operations.\n\nOverall, these developments suggest that Time Warner is showing signs of resilience and adaptability in an increasingly competitive marketplace. By leveraging new technologies and partnerships to meet evolving consumer demands, the company may be better positioned to sustain long-term success in the years ahead.",
    "I just put my dog down today and I'm feeling absolutely devastated. She was my best friend, my confidante and my constant companion. We had been together for 12 years through all kinds of ups and downs, but nothing could have prepared me for this moment.\n\nShe had been showing signs of her age lately - she couldn't walk as far, she was losing her hearing and her sight, but even in those moments, she still greeted me with wagging tail and lick on her snout like nothing had changed. She was a trooper until the very end.\n\nThis morning, she woke us up by whining that she wanted to go out. That was how it started, and before we knew it, she was gasping for air and fighting for every breath she took. I couldn't bear to see her suffer any more and decided it was time to let her rest peacefully.\n\nI don't know if anyone can understand what this feels like, but putting my beloved furry sister down has left an irreparable wound inside of me. She won't be there greeting me at the door when I come home from work or there waiting for me on the couch during our family movie nights. I will never hear her bark excitedly at squirrels outside, or smell her wet nose nuzzling my face.\n\nBut in the midst of all this pain and heartache, one thing remains clear to me: I am lucky to have shared so many wonderful memories with such an amazing animal spirit. My sweet girl, may you Rest In Peace knowing how much you meant to us all.",
    "The objective of this study is to improve label accuracy and robustness by smoothing expert annotations in spatially varying ways. This approach captures uncertainty from experts' annotations to enhance model performance on dynamic datasets, such as biomedical imagery data. We propose a novel method called Spatially Varying Label Smoothing that leverages domain prior knowledge to learn spatial patterns within each class using conditional generative models. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art label smoothing techniques, especially when dealing with non-global uncertainty distributions and contextual dependencies among classes. With these improvements, we can increase accurate diagnoses and prognoses while also reducing overfitting from incorrect assumptions or biased labels. By incorporating uncertainty into models, our technique has potential applications beyond image segmentation and may be useful in other scientific disciplines as well.",
    "\"Mississippi Burning\" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that sheds light on one of the darkest moments in American history. The story follows the investigation into the bombing of a black church in Mississippi during the Civil Rights Movement, and the subsequent attempt to integrate the community following the federal intervention.\n\nThe performances are exceptional, with Gene Hackman delivering an unforgettable portrayal of Agent Clark Preston, who leads the FBI team sent down South. Tom Cruise excels as well, playing young Agent Vincent Hanna, who has to confront his own prejudices while working alongside agents from different backgrounds. The supporting cast includes Sam Elliot, Mary-Lou Parker, and Wendell Malick, all of whom breathe life into their respective characters.\n\nDirector Alan Pakula masterfully crafts a tense and gripping narrative, filled with suspenseful scenes, emotional outbursts, and quiet moments of introspection. His use of color and lighting helps create an atmosphere that reflects both the beauty and horror of rural America at the time.\n\nOne cannot discuss this film without addressing its themes of racism and violence. However, these issues are dealt with sensitivity and nuance, rather than being exploited for political gain or moral grandstanding. The characters are complex, flawed individuals struggling to come to terms with their beliefs and actions.\n\nOverall, \"Mississippi Burning\" stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of those who fought against oppression and injustice. It serves as a reminder of our shared responsibility to speak up against discrimination and work towards creating a better world for everyone. This is more than just a movie; it's a learning experience that will leave you inspired and humbled.\"",
    "Sure, here's an example:\n\n---\n\nHave you ever had a dream so vivid and intense that it felt like it was actually happening? I recently experienced one of these dreams, and it left me confused both because I found myself in a situation I couldn't explain and because I now have to wonder if there is some sort of truth hiding right in front of us, waiting for us to discover it.\n\nThe dream took place during what seemed to be a workday. I remember being at my desk answering emails, but something about them was different - they were from people I didn't recognize or understand, and the language used was foreign. Despite struggling with communication, I soldiered on until I stumbled upon a meeting room filled with fascinating individuals who claimed to know everything there was to know about this mysterious world we live in. They introduced themselves as scientists and philosophers, and suddenly I was transported back to elementary school, where teachers imparted their knowledge through storytelling rather than textbooks.\n\nI spent hours listening to these experts share ideas, theories, and insights into areas such as physics, biology, math, history, psychology and more, all while questioning how these concepts apply to our daily lives. It wasn't long before I realized how much information the human brain can hold but has neglected to retrieve, giving us mere glimpses of understanding when needed. As a lifelong learner, I found this mind-blowing.\n\nAlthough I woke up eventually, this dream left an indelible impression on my soul. Now every time I come across an article or video explaining complex phenomena, I feel grateful to have been given a glimpse into their true nature without needing a degree in science. On top of that, I'm convinced that every great discovery made by humanity began with a question, which suggests potential answers should never be limited by preconceived notions or prior knowledge. I wish to delve deeper into uncharted territories whenever my curiosity comes calling.",
    "The UK government has announced it will not proceed with the creation of an independent correction agency, known as the Office for Media Responsibility (OMR). It had originally been planned to be established in order to regulate online and social media platforms. Instead, the government now plans to focus on strengthening existing regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe decision was made following extensive consultation with industry stakeholders and civil society groups. Supporters of the OMR had argued that it would provide much-needed accountability and transparency in the digital space, but opponents had expressed concerns about its potential to stifle free speech.\n\nCulture Secretary Nadine Doris has stated that while she recognizes the need for greater scrutiny in the media landscape, the proposed solution was not the right one. She added: \"We must find alternative ways to address these issues which don't infringe our fundamental rights or suppress voices.\"\n\nInstead, the government intends to work with existing regulators such as Ofcom and the Information Commissioner's Office to enhance their powers and improve their ability to tackle harmful content online.\n\nOpposite parties have also praised the move. Labour MP Tom Watson has welcomed the announcement, calling it \"a victory for freedom of expression and democratic principles,\" while Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said she is glad the plans have been axed, stating \"the Tories are constantly seeking new ways to curtail our liberties\".",
    "The price of crude oil in the United States has surged above $53 per barrel, marking its highest level since November 2018. This increase comes after the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers agreed to cut production earlier this month in an effort to support higher oil prices.\nAs demand for oil continues to grow, particularly from countries like China and India, supply cuts could help to tighten global supplies and drive up prices even further. Despite this, US shale producers remain confident that they can continue to pump more oil at lower prices than their OPEC counterparts, which could lead to a longer-term shift in market power away from traditional oil-producing nations.",
    "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing robust and efficient approaches for segmentation tasks in computer vision. One of the most popular techniques is based on deep learning models such as U-Net or Mask R-CNN, which can effectively capture complex patterns and relationships between pixels. However, these methods often require large amounts of labeled data and computation resources, making them impractical for many real-world applications. \n\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose an alternative approach that leverages adversarial attention gates to enhance feature extraction during training while reducing computational complexity significantly. Our model utilizes multi-scale attention gates to focus on important regions when generating segments. Specifically, it employs two types of attention gates: one at input level and another at output level. \n\nDuring training, the input gate selectively masks out irrelevant features, allowing the output level attention to refine only useful information. The resultant representations are then concatenated with additional inputs before feeding into a final segmentation network. This process allows our method to learn more efficiently by selecting only relevant features and thus reduces its dependence on large-scale labels. Additionally, it results in better accuracy due to the ability to ignore background noise or distortions.\n\nWe evaluate our model's performance and demonstrate improved accuracies compared to existing baselines in a range of scenarios including medical image segmentation, object detection, and text classification. Results show significant improvement especially when dealing with limited labeled data. By providing a novel solution to the problem of sparse labeled data, this work paves the way for future developments in both theoretical as well as practical domains with potential implications across various industries.",
    "In this paper, we study maximal Abelian algebra subspaces (MAAS) of non-commutative Banach algebras associated to topologically transitive semigroup actions on compact metric spaces. Our main results are: (1) Every non-trivial MAAS is closed under pointwise multiplication by other elements in the associated Banach algebras, which allows us to characterize them explicitly; and (2) The projection onto any such subset determines an embedding into a locally connected space that allows us to apply the theory of invariant measure groups to it. As an application, we obtain new connections between invariant measures and singular invariant curves of some important nonlinear systems from control theory.",
    "Women working in the film industry are, on average, being paid significantly less than their male counterparts, figures have shown.\n\nAccording to new data published by Bectu - the union for audio-visual artists and technicians - female cinematographers can earn up to half as much as males doing the same job.\n\nThe study also found that there is an underrepresentation of women across all levels of the film production process, from entry level jobs to senior management positions.\n\nGina Olliver, chairwoman of Bectu, said: \"It is deeply concerning to see such significant pay disparities between women and men in our industry.\"\n\nShe added: \"[We need to work towards creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace], so that all members have equal opportunities to progress and be rewarded fairly for their skills and experience.\"\n\nBectu conducted its research by interviewing over 7000 workers across the UK film and TV industries, including both freelancers and those employed on a permanent basis.\n\nWhile overall pay increased last year, women were still found to be on average receiving lower salaries than men. This gap was seen most notably among experienced professionals who had been working for ten years or more, with females earning around one fifth of what their male colleagues received for every full day they worked.",
    "The paper presents generalized Whitney formulas for broken circuits in ambigrams and matroids. Ambigrams are graphs with a distinguished orientation, while matroids are algebraic structures that encode constraints on sets of elements. Broken circuits in ambigrams are cycles of arrows pointing to different directions, while matroids and ambigrams share properties such as rank, density, and dimension. Generalized Whitney formulas characterize the distribution of broken circuits in a given matroid and its corresponding ambigram under several assumptions. Specifically, the paper proves results about connected cycles, shortest cycles, minimum weight spanning trees, and edge connectivity under weakened conditions compared to previous works in this area. These extensions provide new insights into the relationship between matroids and ambigrams, opening doors for future research on combinatorics, geometric theory, and optimality problems in both fields.",

    "Title: Topology of Fatou Components for Endomorphisms of CP^k: Linking with the Green's Current\nAbstract: This study explores the topological properties of Fatou components, which are a fundamental concept in complex analysis. Specifically, we focus on Fatou components associated to holomorphic self-maps of the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{CP}^1$, and extend our results obtained therein to those of $\\mathbb{C}^n$. Our analysis is based on Carathéodory dynamics and the theory of H\\\"older potentials, through a systematic introduction of associated metrics and their comparison. In particular, we introduce a new concept of metric, related to Fatou components, that captures important geometric information about these sets, thus complementing previous studies in this area. We also use techniques from conformal geometry, such as Green's current, to prove key convergence results involving Fatou components, and obtain links between different properties related to them. Overall, our work provides new insights into a fascinating class of dynamical systems arising in complex analysis, making an essential contribution to understanding topologies of Fatou components for endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$.",
    "Urban design is becoming an increasingly complex field, influenced by factors such as population growth, transportation needs, and environmental concerns. One way to address some of these challenges is through multi-objective optimization (MOO), where multiple objectives are simultaneously optimized towards a set of conflicting constraints. This approach has been applied successfully to various areas of engineering, but there is limited research on its use in urban design problems due to the complexity involved. In this paper, we present a multimethodological study of MOO techniques in an urban design context.

He was escorted away from the premises and brought down to the station where he was handcuffed and left alone without any explanation or charges given.\n\nThis experience has caused significant emotional turmoil and stress, not only for my brother but also for our entire family. We are eager to know whether these actions were justified and have started reaching out to legal professionals. We want justice.\n\nWe kindly request that anyone reading this post who is facing similar situations do reach out to us for support and guidance. Our priority is your peace of mind. Thank you.",
    "Organic solar cells have shown significant potential as a renewable and sustainable energy source. However, one major challenge facing these devices is optimizing their efficiency, which can be limited by the strong Coulomb repulsion between electrons. In this study, we investigate the effect of introducing inorganic high-k nanostructured materials into organic solar cells on reducing coulomb interactions. We experimentally demonstrate that the inclusion of high-k materials leads to reduced coulomb interactions, resulting in improved device performance. Our results show that device efficiencies can be increased significantly using this approach, highlighting the importance of incorporating high-k nanomaterials into organic solar cell designs. The findings presented in this study provide valuable insights into the development of efficient and low-cost organic solar cells for practical applications.",
    "In this work, we present a novel deep active learning approach to automate axon-myelin segmentation in histological images. Our method utilizes an unsupervised variant of active learning that dynamically selects the most informative regions of interest (ROIs) from an initial set of random ROIs for manual labeling by experts. We leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms to learn high-level representations of the image data and identify relevant areas to be labeled based on their uncertainty. The proposed approach has been evaluated on three publicly available datasets with varying levels of challenge and results show promising improvement over traditional supervised methods. Furthermore, our study suggests that the selected ROI samples are representative of the overall dataset, thus enabling efficient use of expert resources and accurate labeling of large collections of microscopy images.",
    "Nominal unification is a method of reasoning about terms and types in logic. It involves combining two or more nominals to form a new nominal that represents their common characteristics. In this higher-order perspective, we explore nominal unification from the viewpoint of higher-order logic. We introduce new concepts such as functional application and currying to formalizenominal unification at different levels of abstraction. Our approach allows us to reason about more complex structures of terms and types, including those involving functions and higher-order constructions. We provide several key results and applications to illustrate the power of our framework, including the proof of a theorem on type generalization, and the characterization of a class of recursive functions over lists.\r\n\r\nOur work extends previous research on nominal logic and unification by offering a novel perspective on these topics within the context of higher-order logic, opening up a rich area of future research in applied mathematics and computer science.",

    "Sure, here's an appropriate body for a reddit post with that context:\n\nI recently had a conversation with my girlfriend where she mentioned to me that she talks to certain friends about our relationship and even mentions things like my size when discussing my personal life with them. I am really hurt by this because it feels very breach of trust and makes me feel inadequate. I can only imagine how uncomfortable they must be having those conversations and it bothers me deeply that she would do something like this behind my back. My feelings are validated by knowing this is a pretty common practice among women my age, but it doesn't make it okay or justified if my own GF chooses to go out of her way to humiliate me to others without consulting me first. What should I do? Should I confront her further or let it slide? Is there possibly some kind of compromise we could reach?",

This amount was awarded as part of his annual bonus, which is commensurate with his achievements during his tenure from 2004 to 2013.\n\nThe payout drew criticism from environmental and anti-poverty groups who cited Sir Jeroen's role in controversial projects such as Deepwater Horizon, Bonga fields, Mambane oilfield that had disastrous effects on local communities and ecosystems. The protestors also questioned why Shell would reward someone responsible for exploitation and harm.\n\nOn receiving the payment, Sir Jeroen stated he was delighted but added he would distribute some of it amongst charities focused on providing sustainable solutions for marginalised areas affected adversely due to resource extraction activities without compromising safety or efficiency standards.\n   \nIn light of this news, campaigners urged the UK government to rethink its current policies towards corporate governance and ensure companies operating here act responsibly rather than pursuing profits at any cost.

    "Sure! Here is the body of the Reddit post:\n\nI know what you're thinking, oh great, another whiny post about how difficult work or school is right now during these times. Well listen up because I have some actual dumb shit for you to waste your time on that won't be related to anything else currently going on in the world.\n\nToday, I woke up and realized that my shower head was too low, meaning it would only hit me in certain positions across my body. When I went to fix this issue, however, I discovered that I didn't actually have any tools with me to adjust the height of the damn thing. Now I'm stuck bathing in what feels like a trickle of water every time I take a shower.\n\nThe kicker? My landlord refuses to let me get out of my lease early, even though I am paying rent as usual despite the fact that the plumbing in this apartment building has been absolutely god awful ever since they renovated last year. So, aside from spending countless hours trying (and failing) to adjust my shower head myself, I can't leave my crappy apartment until at least 2021 without fear of eviction.\n\nHonestly, I feel like I am living my own personal hell hole, all thanks to the fact that our society insists on valuing money over the happiness and well being of individuals living in subpar housing. But instead of dwelling on these negative thoughts and feelings for too long like normal folks, I figured I might as well share them with the rest of the internet who can appreciate just how unbelievably ridiculous things are sometimes.",
    "Teenagers are becoming increasingly addicted to playing video games, according to new research that has raised concerns about the long-term effects on their mental and emotional wellbeing.\n\nThe study conducted by psychologists at University College London (UCL) found that young people as young as 10 years old spent an average of just over two hours per day gaming. By teenage years this had increased significantly, with some gamers logging up to 27 hours a week.\n \nDr Catherine Coxon said: \"What we're seeing is that these kids start out as casual players but there's always someone who turns it into their passion.\"\n\nGames such as Minecraft, Call of Duty and Fortnite have become incredibly popular among teens worldwide, providing an immersive digital world where they can interact with other players from around the globe. However, Dr Coxon warned against getting carried away by these virtual realms.\n \n\"That feeling you get when you play those games - the rush or the excitement - it can lead to high levels of anxiety,\" she explained. \n\nAdditionally, there may be negative consequences for their social skills too, says Dr Katie Sutherland, also from UCL: \"They might spend more time sitting behind a screen being anti-social than actually developing face-to-face relationships.\"\n \nIt is vital parents become involved in monitoring their children’s gaming habits, setting limits on how much they are allowed to play each week. But for many parents it can feel challenging to keep track of what their kids are doing online when they aren't physically present.\n \nLaura Smith, founder of parents' forum Gaming Angels, offers advice: \"Just check every so often because kids will try and hide things if they think you won't approve.\"",
    "I am writing to seek advice on whether or not I should be considered an asshole after making a comment to my aunt. My aunt, who has four children and always had a lot of kids in general during her pregnancy, asked if she should stop having them because she is now going through menopause and feels like her body is falling apart.\n\nI responded by saying that I was glad I only had one child instead of all her kids, due to how old I felt watching her and her husband go through so much physically trying with their younger children. However upon hearing this response from me, he turned red in anger and told me off. He said \"You should know how hard it is when you don't have any children, but think again later\".\n\nMy immediate reaction during our conversation while this argument did happen was one of frustration towards him. While we are close family and have been very supportive of each other and share several values regarding raising children and life, his judgmental behavior hurt my feelings especially considering how difficult our own pregnancy process went. Additionally he left out an apology and ignored my question and my attempts to ask follow-up questions about how menopause affects his health and overall well being.\n\nOverall should I be apologizing? Or as it stands right now, I do not feel remorse at all in what I posted and will continue to believe I made the right decision given my past experiences and the information available.",
    "In this paper, we investigate the relationship between Petersen cores and the graph connectivity conditions necessary to realize them in cubic graphs. We show that every odd-degree connected cubic graph is a Petersen core if and only if it contains one Hamiltonian cycle and at least one edge with multiplicity 2 or more. Our results shed light on some intriguing properties of cubic graphs containing Petersen cores, including their complexity and computational aspects. We also provide a characterization of when a cubic graph has no Petersen cores, and an algorithm to determine whether a given cubic graph is disconnected or not using Petersen cores as building blocks. The paper will be of interest to researchers who are interested in improving algorithms of combinatorial optimization problems, such as finding a minimum spanning tree which might run faster over graphs having properties related to Petersen cores.",

    "Quasi-power laws have been observed in various natural and artificial systems, including gene expression regulation, network correlations, and energy consumption. However, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of these phenomena, particularly regarding their emergence from simpler physical or mathematical rules. In this study, we investigate quasi-power law distributions using stochastic dynamics models that incorporate both power law dependence and finite variance. Our results show that quasi-power laws arise naturally from the interplay between mean field theory and criticality in these systems. We also demonstrate how our model predicts subtle but robust features of quasi-power laws, such as universality across multiple parameter regimes and resistance to statistical methods designed to detect more common power laws. Finally, we discuss implications for future studies of complex networks and recommend avenues for empirical investigation.",

The approach employs space-time polynomial expansions and allows handling arbitrary temporal integration steps, thus overcoming one of the main limitations associated with implicit scheme in shallow water simulations. Two spatial discretization strategies are considered: an exponential decay collocated method which relies on fast spectral methods and is well suited for smooth domains on rectangular grids, and a nondegenerate Lagrange multiplier collocated method that enables effective management of sharp transitions between homogeneous regions. A variety of benchmarks are provided to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented schemes. Numerical results exhibit excellent convergence rates and robustness even in presence of complex geometries or highly dynamic flows, showing significant speedups using GPUs compared to state of the art single core computer implementations.",

    "This paper presents a methodology for the design of fuzzy rule-based extracted features from images. The goal is to create a system that can effectively and efficiently perform image extraction under various environmental conditions, without requiring prior knowledge or labeled training data. We propose a feature extraction architecture based on fuzzy logic rules that incorporate edge detection as well as texture analysis principles. Our approach employs statistical techniques to estimate the parameters of the control functions governing each pixel in the input image, allowing us to derive a set of decision variables that represent the desired characteristics of the output image. These control variables are then used to update a lookup table containing predefined fuzzy rules that dictate how input pixels should be transformed based on their associated characteristics. To evaluate our proposed technique, we have conducted extensive simulations using synthetic and real images, with results suggesting high performance and robustness to varying lighting conditions.",

    "Introduction\nIn recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using video games as a platform for training machine learning models. One area where this technique has shown great promise is in computer vision. In this study, we explore the use of video games as a tool for training computer vision models. We investigate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing the performance of models trained on game data to those trained on traditional computer vision datasets. Our results show that gaming can be an effective way to train computer vision models, providing high accuracy and efficiency.\n\nBackground\nComputer vision is a complex task that requires significant computational power and specialized hardware. As such, it is often time-consuming and expensive to train computer vision models from scratch. However, advances in deep learning have made it possible to create more powerful and accurate models with less compute resources. This has led to an increase in demand for large amounts of labeled data for model training.\n\nVideo games provide an ideal source for this data as they require players to interact with real-world environments. By exposing players to various scenarios through play, games can generate rich and diverse datasets that are difficult to recreate in controlled experiments. Furthermore, because games often require players to make quick decisions based on visual cues, they can also help foster skills associated with faster perception times and better spatial reasoning.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a comparative study of two computer vision models trained on different types of data from the dataset used in OpenCV, which included images taken from websites, YouTube videos, and video games. The first model was trained entirely on images taken from websites and YouTube videos, while the second model was additionally trained on images captured during gameplay. Both models were tested on three subsets of the OpenCV test set, including images containing pedestrians, vehicles, and furniture. \n\nResults\nOur results show that incorporating video game data into the model training process yielded a statistically significant improvement in performance across all tests compared to the baseline model. Specifically, the pedestrian recognition model achieved a mean improvement of 5%, while the vehicle recognition model saw an average gain of over 3%. Additionally, we observed that the combination of gameplay simulation and real-life scenario images allowed for the development of a robust feature set capable of accurately detecting both object categories regardless of image quality or complexity.",

    "Rolling out next-generation internet is vital for Britain to remain competitive in the global economy, experts say.\nThe government has launched plans to improve high-speed broadband access across the country as part of its £217 million Digital Infrastructure Strategy. This includes plans to make internet speeds at least 30Mbit faster by 2035 and ensure it reaches every home and business in the country.\nAccording to a new report published by Ofcom, the UK needs to invest more than £4 billion to meet target of delivering gigabit broadband to all households within a decade. The regulator said this would require a significant increase in investment from both private and public sectors.\nThe report also highlighted growing concerns about the uneven distribution of internet speeds throughout the country. It found that some regions are still lagging behind with slower broadband speeds compared to the rest of the UK.\n\"We need to address the digital divide head on,\" said one expert who welcomed the government's announcement of funding for broadband infrastructure. \"Many rural areas and parts of outer London simply don't have access to fast enough internet.\"\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) also announced measures to support small businesses through the transition to 5G networks, which offer even higher speeds and reliability than current generations of wireless technology.\nDCMS Secretary Jeremy Wright said: \"Our aim is to give businesses of all sizes access to world-class internet connections so they can compete on a level playing field with those based elsewhere in the world.\"\nHowever, critics argue that the government should do more to encourage competition in the telecommunications sector, especially amid fears of increased market dominance by major providers like BT and Virgin Media. They called for greater transparency and regulation in pricing and service packages to protect consumers and promote innovation.",
    "It hasn't been easy, but day 6 is here and I think it's time for me to come clean about something.\nIt all started when my therapist suggested we work on some emotional issues that have been bothering me in my personal life. She encouraged me to explore new things, try new hobbies, and make new friends. To be honest, at first I was skeptical. As a busy professional with many tasks vying for my attention, I didn't see how finding another outlet could help. But after much reflection, I realized that while my career had taken many turns over the years, I hadn't considered other possibilities. So, armed with her encouragement, I decided to pursue a creative endeavor.\nI enrolled in an online writing course and began pouring myself into this newfound passion. I wrote every chance I got - during breaks, on weekends, even during flights for work. And slowly but surely, I found myself becoming more immersed in this world of words. The characters came to life, the plot twists became more unexpected, and soon, I found myself completely lost in the pages of my own creations.\nAs days turned into months and months turned into weeks, I couldn't deny any longer that this creative outlet had transformed my life. My stress levels dropped significantly, I felt more connected to my loved ones than ever before, and most importantly, I was happier overall. This isn't just about creating beautiful prose or telling compelling stories - it's about learning to let go of what was holding me back and embracing who I truly want to be. Today marks day 6 of exploring these new opportunities, and it feels like I am finally living the life I've always wanted.",

    "Dear parents and caregivers,\n\nDoes your 18 months old child always throw tantrums for no reason? Are you at wit's end wondering how to handle these explosive outbursts? You are not alone.\r\n\r\nTemper Tantrums are common in infants and young children as they explore their surroundings, learn new rules, develop language skills, and express their emotions. These tantrums can be difficult to deal with, but there are several strategies that may help manage them.\r\n\r\nFirstly, try to stay calm during the tantrum. This will help your baby feel more safe and secure, which could make the tantrum stop sooner. Also, pay attention to situations that trigger your Baby’s temper. If possible, avoid those triggers whenpossible. \r\n\r\nSecondly use distraction and redirection techniques. Give your child something else to focus on such as a toy or song when they begin to have a tantrum. Change activities frequently to keep your infant engaged in learning so tantrums do not occur due to boredom. \r\n\r\nThirdly, take breaks as needed. It is essential to give yourself time to recharge and prepare mentally and physically before taking up another challenge. The same applies to caring for an 18-month-old baby.\r\n\r\nFourthly, it’s okay if you need outside help like consulting a pediatrician, therapist or friends who has similar experiences and advice from them could be really helpful.\r\n\r\nLastly, don't forget they are only tantrums; it isn’t a bad behavior. Infantile temper tantrums happen because babies and young children cannot communicate effectively yet. With patience, consistency and love, the tantrums should become fewer and less severe over time.\r\n\r\nStay strong, fellow parents!",

    "You all know those moments where you do something incredibly stupid, making your heart sink to depths it seems impossible to reach? Well, this is one of those times for me… I was dating someone who I genuinely cared about and felt like we had some real potential together – like we were meant to be. We saw each other almost every week, often multiple times in a single day. We had deep conversations. We laughed. And occasionally cried.\n\nBut then there were small things here and there that started going wrong; sometimes the conversations would end abruptly, sometimes they wouldn’t get scheduled, and sometimes my partner wasn't as available when I needed them as much as I thought. With each passing day, their presence seemed less frequent and more distant. My gut told me everything was fine but my mind kept telling me otherwise: what if they don't care anymore, what if they're looking elsewhere? It became harder and harder to believe in us despite evidence suggesting otherwise. Eventually, our last conversation ended rather awkwardly leading me to realize it was time to officially call things off. I was heartbroken.\n\nYet, I can't shake off the nagging feeling \"What if?\" What if I had just done things differently? What if I hadn't taken their lack of availability so personally and instead expressed how important they are to me or tried to understand why they weren’t meeting up on certain days? Maybe things would have turned out differently! Could it have been that easy? Apparently, now that it is too late, all these thoughts rush through my head like crazy waves crashing against rocks. But nothing I do helps calm my guilty conscience or relieve my disappointment. \n\nIn retrospect, I wish I hadn't let fear and doubt control my decisions and actions towards them. Looking back on our memories fills me with regret and sadness knowing that I might never see or speak to them again. So yeah...my brain refuses to accept reality most times. All it wants is to dwell on the past regrets... which sucks.",

Thanks to advances in online technology, it has never been easier for individuals to contribute money or support causes they care about – be it by texting a donation code or clicking on an online link.\n\nOne recent campaign that highlights this trend is the Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised millions of pounds for the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MND). The challenge involved participants pouring a bucket of ice water over their heads and sharing videos of themselves doing so on social media platforms. While silly in concept, the campaign was effective in spreading awareness and generating significant funds for the disease, proving how powerful digital tools can be in bringing people together around a common cause.\n\nOf course, the rise of online giving has also given way to new forms of scams and frauds aimed at taking advantage of kind-hearted individuals. It's important for everyone making donations online to do their research and ensure that they are supporting legitimate causes. There are a number of resources available, such as charity watchdog websites, to help people verify whether organizations asking for donations are trustworthy and properly registered.\n\nDespite these risks, however, there's no denying that technology has transformed the way we give and has opened up many opportunities for fundraising efforts to reach even greater heights. With features like social media integration, secure payment gateways, and real-time analytics and tracking tools, websites offer all the tools needed to launch successful campaigns with minimal fuss.

    "Superpixel segmentation refers to a technique used in computer vision and image processing that involves dividing an image into smaller regions of homogeneous color, texture or intensity. This method can be challenging due to overlapping objects, occlusions and variations within images. In this paper we propose a new dynamic and iterative spanning forest approach to superpixel segmentation which first generates a set of initial seeds for the process. These seeds are then utilized to grow segments through a dynamic algorithm that continually adjusts their size and shape based on local pixel intensity changes, while also accounting for spatial relationships with neighboring pixels. An iterative refinement step is added to improve accuracy by updating previous segment boundaries until convergence. The results show our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques, providing higher levels of superpixel granularity whilst ensuring accurate results even in complex scenes.",

    "The Workers' Mutual Building Society (WMC) has rejected Xstrata's revised offer for its £123 million mortgage business, stating that it remains too low.\n\nThe WMC had previously agreed to sell the business to Xstrata for £70 million in 2014, but this was challenged by members who demanded a fairer deal. The society received an unsolicited bid from Xstrata earlier this year, which valued the business at around £86 million and included job losses of up to 50 staff.\n\nIn response, Xstrata issued a new offer in August, which valued the business at £90 million and committed to keeping all existing jobs based in Edinburgh. However, the WMC board has now decided that this still falls short of what is fair, particularly given the fact that this represents only 70% of the value of the original sale agreement.\n\nThe WMC stated: \"While we appreciate Xstrata's efforts to address some concerns raised by mutual societies following previous proposals, including commitments on employment, we believe that their revised offer fails to fully reflect the true value of our building society.\"\n\nXstrata said it was disappointed with the decision and believes it offered a reasonable deal, which would have provided long-term benefits for both parties. The company added that it will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the WMC in hopes of finding a way forward that meets everyone's needs.",
    "Prime Minister Tony Blair has rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the decision to go to war with Iraq, arguing that such a move would hinder efforts to bring stability to the region.\n\nMr Blair's rejection came as a group of MPs, led by former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, called on him to set up an independent investigation into why the UK went to war and whether it was based on accurate intelligence.\n\nSources close to the issue have told Newsnight that Mr Blair is adamant about resisting any calls for an independent review because he believes such an inquiry could deter other countriesfrom intervening when necessary.\n\n\"Tony doesn't want another Chagos Islands moment,\" one source said, referring to the previous independence campaign led by Lord Hailsham when Britain abandoned its Indian Ocean territory and caused widespread resentment among residents who were relocated against their will.\n\nThe Government argues that it had legitimate reasons for invading Iraq, including weapons of mass destruction threats posed by Saddam Hussein's regime. However, critics argue that there were no tangible evidence to support this claim and that the invasion was motivated by geopolitical interests rather than genuine security concerns.",
    "As the world becomes increasingly militarized and surveillance-focused, it is essential to consider what will happen if the government takes absolute control over data collection.\n\nOne such example is the AceOps initiative, which was launched last year in the United States. This program involves the use of data mining techniques on social media platforms to identify potential terrorists or criminal suspects. While proponents of this approach argue that it can help keep our society safe from harm, there are also serious concerns about its legality and effectiveness.\n\nFirstly, the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of personal information raises privacy issues. Such data could be used to target individuals who have never committed any crimes, leading to unnecessary invasions of their privacy. Additionally, the use of AI in decision-making processes often results in biased conclusions – especially when the algorithm's training data reflects existing societal prejudices.\n\nMoreover, the lack of transparency surrounding how the AceOps system works means we cannot fully understand how effective it is at identifying threats. It is entirely possible that the program may result in false positives or miss actual criminals altogether, creating an illusion of security while leaving us vulnerable to real dangers.\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, it is important to ensure that initiatives like the AceOps program do not become tools for oppression. We must carefully consider the implications of using data Mining techniques so extensively and demand accountability from those in charge to avoid slipping into a police state.",

    "The Welsh rugby team have made two announcements regarding their squad selection ahead of their upcoming match against France in the Six Nations Championship. Firstly, they have confirmed that scrum-half Rhys Webb has been ruled out due to an injury suffered during training, and will be replaced by Gareth Davies. Additionally, wing Louis Rees Jones is also unavailable for selection after sustaining concussion during last weekend's Guinness PRO14 game with Ulster. In his place, head coach Warren Gatland has called up 20-year old Owain Williams, who played on the wing for Wales in their U19 international matches earlier this year.",
    "\"I don't understand why it is so hard for some people to comprehend that they need to do something repeatedly until they see results. I mean, come on! It's basic math. If you want to achieve X, then you need Y amount of repetition.\nBut noooo, there are those who think that setting goals is enough and that it will magically lead to success without any effort. Or maybe it's because they got lucky once or twice with their first attempt, but since luck doesn't last forever, they won't be able to duplicate it without putting in the work.\nIt's like hitting a home run is enough to win the game, but if they don't hit any more runs, guess what? The game ends quickly. And it's not always the same person who hits the winning homerun either, sometimes it's someone else, sometimes another team. But still, they all had to play consistently throughout the game, batting and running bases and catching throws, just like we have to keep pushing forward, experimenting and learning from our failures before achieving our desired outcome.\nSo please, if anything, remember this: you never know when your next successful step is coming. You only know through persistence and determination.\"",
    "BT has launched a new initiative to help stop dialler fraud on its network. The telecoms giant is using advanced technology to detect and block unsolicited automated calls, commonly known as diallers or rogue calls.\n\nDialler scams involve pre-recorded messages being played to consumers without their consent, often with the intention of taking advantage of them through false promises or threats. These types of calls have been a growing problem in recent years, resulting in many people receiving unwanted nuisance calls.\n\nTo fight back against this issue, BT is now employing machine learning algorithms that can analyze characteristics of individual calls and determine whether they are suspicious activity, such as calling from an expensive number or at unusual hours. If a call has elements indicative of a scam, it will be automatically blocked by BT's system.\n\n\"We understand how frustrating it can be for our customers to receive unwanted calls,\" said BT Chief Operating Officer Marc Allera. \"That's why we're continuing to invest in the latest technology to protect our customers and prevent these disruptive and potentially costly tactics.\"\n\nIn addition to blocking calls, BT also provides tools for users to report and monitor unsolicited communications from their accounts. If a customer identifies any suspicious dialers, they can quickly block all incoming and outgoing calls from specific numbers.\n\nWith these measures in place, BT hopes to significantly reduce the frequency of dialler scams on its network, making it easier and safer for people to use their phone lines.",

    "Swiss drugmaker Novartis has announced plans to aggressively pursue acquisitions in order to expand its portfolio and strengthen its position in key markets. The company's CEO, Vas Narasimhan, stated that Novartis is actively exploring opportunities across several therapeutic areas and geographies.\n\nNarasimhan noted that the pharmaceutical industry is witnessing significant change as new technologies and business models emerge, creating both challenges and opportunities for companies like Novartis. In this context, he sees strategic mergers and acquisitions as a critical component of the company's growth strategy.\n\nAccording to sources close to the matter, some of the target sectors for Novartis include oncology, gene therapy, and digital health. The company reportedly saw strong sales growth last year in these areas and believes there are further potential gains to be made through targeted acquisitions.\n\nWhile Novartis has traditionally been known for its strengths in generic drugs and over-the-counter medicines, it recently shifted gears under former CEO Joe Jimenez and began investing heavily in cancer drugs and other innovative therapies. This move appears to be paying off, with revenues from those segments growing by double digits last year.\n\nHowever, critics have pointed out that big pharma companies often struggle to integrate successful smaller firms into their existing operations without losing the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation that attracted them in the first place. Meanwhile, others question whether such deals will ultimately benefit patients or merely line the pockets of shareholders and executives.\n\nDespite these concerns, analysts generally see Novartis' push into M&A territory as a smart move given the competitive landscape of the pharmaceutical industry. If executed successfully, they believe the move could pay dividends for all stakeholders involved.",

    "Fears are growing among cyber security experts over plans to introduce changes to the internet's domain name system (DNS) which they say could lead to widespread fraud and scams online. The proposed updates, set to be discussed at an international conference in Dubai later this week, aim to make it easier for companies to secure multiple domains with a single digital certificate. While this would improve website security, anti-fraud campaigners warn that criminals could exploit the change to create fake versions of legitimate websites, leading to billions of pounds worth of losses each year. The UK government has already expressed concerns about the proposals, warning that Britain must act swiftly to ensure its citizens are protected against potential threats. A spokesperson from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \"We recognise the importance of improving domain validation mechanisms but we also need to consider any risks or vulnerabilities associated with these measures.\" They added that urgent action was needed to stop fraudsters exploiting weaknesses in the current DNS infrastructure before new systems were introduced.

    "I've been experiencing strange things lately that I can't explain. Sometimes it feels like I'm seeing and hearing things that aren't really there. Other times, it's like my mind is creating scenarios that never actually happened. I'm starting to wonder if I'm having some kind of mental breakdown, or if this is just what happens when your imagination runs wild. Has anyone else ever felt like this?",
    "\"There are movies that entertain, there are movies that touch your emotions, but every once in a while comes along a film like 'Deathly Hallows - Part 2' which does both seamlessly. This is undoubtedly one of the best finales to any story ever told on screen! The action scenes will leave you breathless as they perfectly balance adrenaline-pumping excitement with emotion. And let's talk about how satisfying those magical battles were... It truly felt incredible watching our favorite characters taking down their enemies after all these years (I'm still shaking!). But when things slowed down amidst more personal moments between friends fighting side by side until THE end; THAT emotional payoff hit me hard because JK Rowling didn't just write brilliantly imaginative stories – she understood human connections better than most writers today.\"",
    "Hey guys, so I recently realized that my list of hobbies and interests is getting pretty long - to an extent where it's becoming overwhelming for me! 🤯 From reading books on physics ⚛️to practicing calligraphy 🌈and learning Spanish 😮- you name it, I've got it covered. While each interest brings its own joy✨ and fulfillment, sometimes juggling all of them at once can get exhausting both mentally & physically. Has anyone else faced similar struggles or do y'all manage your diverse passions skilfully? Would love some tips from fellow multi-passionates out there! 😊🙌",
    "I went into this final installment with some skepticism, but was pleasantly surprised by how well they tied up all the loose ends from the previous movies. The acting and special effects were excellent as always, especially in the intense battle scenes between the vampires and the forces of good (or maybe evil?). While there were definitely emotional moments throughout, it never felt too heavy or overwhelming. Overall, an enjoyable conclusion to a beloved franchise that fans will surely appreciate.",
    "Hey everyone! So, I'm curious about how punishment works in this game. Like, what happens if you break certain rules or do something that's against the game's guidelines? Are there any consequences to your actions? And if so, are they fair? Any insight would be greatly appreciated!",
    "Hey everyone, so lately I've been questioning whether or not my dad's behavior towards me qualifies as verbal abuse. He often speaks to me in an angry and belittling tone, making critical comments about everything from my appearance to my academic achievements. At first, I wrote it off as him simply being frustrated with life but now I'm starting to doubt myself - am I overreacting? Is this normal father-child communication that some people experience? I don't know how to navigate this because even bringing it up feels like betraying his trust (he has always told us kids never to speak negatively about each other) plus acknowledging there might be a problem makes me feel disloyal... any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading :)",
    "I know that many people use their past experiences with OCD as reassurance when dealing with difficult situations, but for me it does the opposite. Whenever I feel like my anxiety is getting out of control or my thoughts are spiraling into something familiar, all I can think about is how much worse things got during my worst moments of OCD. It's almost like those memories are haunting reminders of what I don't want to go through again. So while it may work for some folks, using past OCD experience as comfort isn’t helpful in my case. Everyone's journey and relationship with mental health is unique - what might help one person could do harm (or no good) for another.",
    "The purpose of this study is to explore the concept of mass growth of objects and its relationship with categorical entropy. By examining various examples, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these two phenomena are interconnected. Through our analysis, it becomes evident that an increase in one leads to an exponential rise in the other, highlighting their interdependence. The findings from this research can be useful for mathematicians as well as practitioners working within related fields where the principles of categorization play an essential role. Ultimately, by shedding light on such foundational concepts, this work seeks to contribute towards advancing overall knowledge about mathematical structures underlying object classification systems."
