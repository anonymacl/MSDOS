GM\r\n\r\nhas created driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in some danger.\r\n\r\nSensors are'nt new , in the 1980's automarkers used speedsenors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. It's alot os sensors around but just in some places you can't find them or even reconized them until you put your hands on it , then it would either go off or beep but you would kno if its a sensor or not.",
        "A vast majority of people who have seen \"The Face on Mars\" belive that it was created by aliens.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be true because there is too much evidence to disprove this conspiracy theory.\r\n\r\nThe Face on Mars was not created by aliens because it, in fact, does not even resemble a face, and there are many others like it on Mars.\r\n\r\nThere is too little evidence supporting that it was created by aliens, but there is pleanty of evidence that supports the fact that it is just another rock formation on Mars.\r\n\r\nOne example of this evidence is that The Face doesn't look like a face at all.\r\n\r\nIn the passage \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" is states that the picture taken in 2001 of the eleged face \"actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 2001 image taken by MSG (Mars Global Surveyor) you can clearly see the large rock formation that is present on Mars surface.\r\n\r\nIt very clearly shows that it is not a face created by ancient aliens.\r\n\r\nSome strong belivers in the theory that think it was created by aliens state that NASA is covering up the truth and not telling the public the truth about the Face.\r\n\r\nThis however just would not make any sense.",
        "The author should continue studying Venus despite the dangers it presents. because in the text it talks about how they had to stop studying Venus since the spacecraft would not survive more than a few hours.\r\n\r\nWhat they know about Venus is how thick its atomosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide, and its challenging are the clouds of sulfuric acid. The planets surface the average surface is 90 times much more then on earth. And it has the hottest temperature in the solar system even if Mercury is the cloest its not as hot as Venus.\r\n\r\nSince no spacecraft survived the landing more than a few hours. They would stop because it wouldn't survive. It explains why they haven't got a spacecraft to stay at Venus. And what I would have to guess on why they didn't survive is probadly because how intense Venus really is. Now by intense I mean how strong the planet really is. Now more then 3 decades Venus has not had a spacecraft there. They haven't gave up. But they're trying to find a way.\r\n\r\nNASA is working on other ways to study Venus.",
        "Although many people think that the \"Face on Mars\" was created by aliens, I believe that it's just a landform. Before spotting this landform, NASA had no further information on alien's on Mars. Also, the camera that the team used was at its' maximum resolution, meaning that they wouldn't miss a thing. Lastly, the team could enlarge the picture three times bigger, so they could see things located on the ground.\r\n\r\nBefore the team at NASA spotted the \"Face on Mars\" they hadn't heard anything about there being a possibility of aliens on Mars. Therefore, I think It's highly doubtful that this could happen.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first look that the team took was a little hazy, they went back with a higher quality camera, which they set at the maximum resolution. With this camera it would be very unlikely for them to missunderstand an alien creation as a landform.\r\n\r\nLastly, on top of having a high quality camera, the team could enlarge the picture up to three times bigger. This helped them so much that it allowed them to see things as close as the ground. After this, it was positive they couldn't miss a thing.\r\n\r\nConsidering that before the NASA team spotted the \"Face on Mars\" there was no further evidence of aliens living on Mars.",
        "The author suports the idea because in the text he says that Venus is kind of earths twin cause its the same size. The author also wants to do that because he says that although Venus is a dangerous panet that it could still be studied.He puts in there that even though Venus is the second-closet planet to the sun that it has many different features than Mercury. Considering the fact that Mercury is the closet planet to the Sun, but it has different qualities than Venus. The Earth is different from Venus because Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees.",
        "Driverless cars would be a positive advancement in our modern society because they'll be safe, cheap, and helpful for people.\r\n\r\nThese high-tech cars, once fully developed, could be much safer than current buses or taxis. Driverless cars would be completly covered in sensors, as stated in chapter 4, \"Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.\" using Google's mostly-driverless car as an example. These sensors provide a, \"constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.\" which could be programmed to be much more aware than human eyes. Sensors have been around for a while, and could provide lots of safety once fully developed.\r\n\r\nThe driverless cars would also be cheaper and more earth-friendly in the long run. In chapter 1, it says, \"The car he (Sergey Brin) foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis...\" which is a big statement. In North America gas prices are constantly fluctuating but are generally considered to be quite high. These cars, using half the gas of current taxis, will be a good deal versus current gas prices. If these cars do become the majority of transportation, some people will also stop buying their own cars, which is a huge investment. Plus, using less gas will lead to a healthier enviornment. Driverless cars will eliminate the hefty gas-usage and large money investments.",
        "I dont think that the technology that shows peoples emotions should be for everyone.I think it should just be for scients to see more into human emotions and to see how it effects us. Letting anyone to have the ability to see emotions just from one simple picture could be harmful at times.\r\n\r\nFor example, someone could be very happy then a second later something sad popped into there head like their animal died and it makes them slightly sad, and then they send a picture to their friend and they might think that something really bad happened\r\n\r\nbut in reality nothing really did, but they keep on bugging them about it and it makes them get to get into a fight and ruins a friendship.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that it wont be helpful but it could ruin something.There are different ways to see this, some people could see how it will help others, some see that its a threat or invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\nBut i think that it shouldnt come out yet because it could harm someone if it gets out of hand.",
        "Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in. Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school. To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one. The use of reading a students emotions is valuable in many ways like helping with possible depression, enhancing the material, and creating a better enviroment.\r\n\r\nSchool can be a stressful time for many students and also a time of growth. Especially in high school and even middle school, the childs body is going through puberty. This chemical change in the body can lead to mood swings and other issues especially when school stress is added on top. This technology is capable of indicating \"...the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\"(paragraph 7). With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion.\r\n\r\nAlso, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases. However with the aid of this technology \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" (paragraph 6). If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well. For difficult classes being able to know when the students are lost would help significantly in increasing the understanding of the material as teachers will be able to know exactly what the students dont understand, and thus be able to help them achieve better grades.\r\n\r\nBeing able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall.",

Also you can hold table tennise tournaments and many other things in the holds. Lastly you can make new friends with the other seagoing cowboy that are on the boat with you.

        "I think I would go with the idea of developing cars that are driverless because of how it functions, what it uses, and why we use it. How it works is that its just a normal car, but it drives all by itself. I think thats a good thing because if lets say if a family has a huge celebration and they forgot something at the store. Well, we can let the car go get the things that they need without leaving the house to miss anything. So, the car uses a huge amount of battery power and goes get the things from the store. The car also uses no fuel or half of the fuel that we use today.\r\n\r\nThese cars thats going to be built in the future is going to save alot of money and it will not effect our ecosystem and not waste anything. What it uses is mainly under alot of wires but mainly runs to a big battery that charges all night and runs all day without having to stop at gas stations and refuel everytime. Plus, the car has to use a gps sensor to find out its surroundings of the car like in paragraph 4. It states that it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Which is a smart idea because, if there is something nearby and it sensor it and warn the driver.\r\n\r\nThe final thing that I want to talk about the driverless cars is why we use it. Back then, they made a special track that only a smart car can drive on and they wanted to put magnets in the road so, the car can track the positive and the negative so the car will not get into a crash.",
        "The author suggests that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus has her terrible conditions. He gives several examples. One of the examples is that, on Venus there is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets it. To even make it harder. The clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acidbin the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe second example is that scientists are still talking abot making a vist there when they know the surface is to dangerous. There are astronomers that are real amazed at Venus because they belive the Venus was once almost like Earth a really long time ago. Venus long ago was probably covered with oceans and could have had various life forms like Earth. Venus till this day has a rocky surface, valleys, mountains and craters like Earth. The value of retuning to Venus seems indisputable.\r\n\r\nThe last example is that NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Imagain a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the surface of Venus. It would sit 30 miles above the surface For it being that hogh it would avoid the conditions of Venus but it would still be hot. It would be about 170 degress Farhrenheit, but the air pressure would colse to sea level.",
        "Is there such thing that a computer can define our emotions? How can a computer software define our emotions? Now in days, the technology is getting bigger as the years pass by people start to know even how to make a car drive by themselves that is one of the things we do not hear everyday. The computer sowftware that can define our emotionsis now that people use in work or even at school use.\r\n\r\nImagine the world with the computer software that can read our emotions that will be very amazing. For instance, you can probably not tell the emotions on somebody face when you see them they may be smiling right at you, but what if they are feeling another way you may never know what they are actually feeling that is why i think the computer software is a good idea to read people emotions. As the time goes by people are getting tired of showing the same feeling they might already started to think that they are not getting no where with what they are feeling. Of course, that everybody know how to describe what happy and sad looks like, but what if they are not feeling none of does emotions what if they are actually nervous or scared and there is no way that you can help them. The computer software stores alots of energy different kind of specific emotions that people can use to tell other people's emotions.",

Driving on your own may be more safe than trusting technolgy to get you somewhere .Driving one of the driverless cars sounds like you can rest or just sit back and watch where you are going but what if you get in a crash and you didnt do anything the car did that might take alot of money out of your pockets for something you didnt even do.",
        "Using this type of technology of emotional expressions will be very useful for teacher and parents to help their students or children to see if something or someone is making them feel happy, angry, disgusted, or feared. Having this technology in schools will also help parents because the parents don't have to buy a computer that can try to handle this type of technology.\r\n\r\nIf teachers do a test on students that are getting bulied or getting picked on, this type of technology will help teacher get students to speak up and or find the person that is bullys other students. By showing the student that's getting pick on a picture of students the teacher thinks who maybe the person bulling the student, the student may make a fear face on the picture of the person that is picking on the student.\r\n\r\nIf teachers see that a student is failing their classes and don't talk a lot in school, the teachers can make a test on that student to see if they are going through things back at home. Teachers can have the students parents to come to the school while the student is being tested, they can have a converation on what makes the student angry or depressed about.\r\n\r\nThose are some example why I think this type of technology can really help teachers and parents learn about their students or children that they don't want to speak of.",
        "How scared would you be if you looked to your right and you saw no one at the steering wheel of the car next to you? Well many car companies are working on driverless cars for the public. This technology although imperfect at the moment has been around for years. It stated in a article that, \"Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009.\" However, driverless cars are dangerous and should be banned because they are not completely driverless, legal issues if there was a car crash, and the technology is still too insufficent to be trusted.\r\n\r\nFirst, the \"driverless\" cars are not completely driverless. For example in an article it stated, \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" With this information we can see that \"driverless\" cars are still not completely driverless. This can make it dangerous if the driver is not paying attention, when attention is needed. This could be fatal if the driver failed to get to the steering wheel in time.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the legal issues that would be created by this new form of car would be catastrofical numbers of laww suits. The question of who would be responsible is a difficult one. In the text it stated, \"...if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" This question does raise a lot of legal issues. Many states in fact have already banned this car. It stated in the text, \" As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars, California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Coloumbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autononomous cars...\" As you see many states have banned these self driving machines, obiously for good resons, because of all the law suits, legal issues, and because they are dangerous.\r\n\r\nFinally, The technology is still too insufficent to be trusted with the lives of innocent people.",
        "Whether you are someone who believes conspiracy theories, or are just plain stupid and think that somehow the Face is evidence of alien life, you are still wrong. It's just a rock, a plain, thousands of years old, heap of rock. The End, no \"Ifs, ands, or buts\", there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa, a landform, we have picture proof of it. However, considering that I must write this for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, I still have to argue about it pointlessly with an imaginary person who might or might not exist. So, I will cover two major points to prove to you that it's a landform, common sense, and the facts that we here at NASA have proven to be true.\r\n\r\nFirst off, this argument is over whether Face was created by aliens, or whether it is just a natural landform. This is a pretty strange argumental topic, as people who believe this stuff anyway will hardly be convinced by a random scientist at NASA. Anyway, there is proof we have that face is just a natural landform, we have taken multiple pictues of it, and have concluded that, as shown with this cite of evidence, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the America West.\" We can even say that it was not obscured by any clouds or haze because it was clear day on Mars the day the picture was taken. That should be the end of the discussion, but yet you say, \"But Mister science man, what if the pictures that you took couldn't see it because it was too small?\" Well, that point can actually be rebuted as well, because of what Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixer size,\" he added. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\".",

Driverless would have to use sensors aournd the whole\r\n\r\ncar for the car to drive propely. Google has modified a Toyota Prius by putting senseors aournd the car. Google's car had driven miles without crashing. There will be times when a person will have to take over and drive the driverless car beacause the driverless car can't navigate through construction site, drive ways, and heavt traffic.\r\n\r\nGoogle and GM have made systems to alert the driver in the car to take over and drive the car. States will have to make new law for driverless cars. People have their doubts about driverless car like what would happen if the alewrt system doesn't work or crashs from the driverless car will cause problem. Then people will not know who to blame the driver or the manufacturer? Automakers will continue their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.

        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" i chosed to be on the maunufacturers side becuase the sensor is a good and safe idea for us people that drive. they can ster, accelerate,and break by themselves. There are some sensor that have a vibration in the seat it tells you when your vehicle is in danger backing into a danger.\r\n\r\nobject . Also using heads up displays when your driving like some thing are not available like trying to text and call someone on the phone.\r\n\r\nThe driverless car is a great idea beacuse the car tells you when you should break. Reason why this is a good ideas it can steer for you what if it really slippery out and you have no controll the sensor will help you keep calm of the car. The sensor tell you when you should go fast and slow down. this may reduce the amount of car crashes.\r\n\r\nThe senor that vibrate when you are driving is a well thought process because is your driving of the rode your seat will virbate telling you your off the road. also it tells you when you need to get back in your lane when you are driving. this will reduce car crashes because it helps indacte where you are driving.",

The way the rocks were fromed they made it look like a face when it really was not. The shadows from the planet also played a part in the story. It gave an illusion that the eyes, nose, and mouth peolpe just wanted to make a big deal of nothing.\r\n\r\nThe way the people tried to make it bigger than what it is that makes people more hype and they are going to think that it life on Mars. There is nothing on Mars like an other life froms. It was just a crazy story that somebody made up to get people to panic or take intrest in nothing. All they did was make free addvirstivement for NASA thats really all they did.They was all over the place they was in magazines, books, Hollywood films and haunted grocery store checkout.\r\n\r\nSome of the scientist wanted it to be a alien artifact but they knew it was not.

In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is a near by planet, and it has much intel that we need to understand. Is the data, and research we could get from this mysterious planet worth the risk? The research we can get from Venus is well worth the risk it may take to retrieve the data needed.\r\n\r\nWe have never been to this planet before in person, but we have had unmanned ships come to Venus but with the outstanding temperatures of 800 or more degrees Fehrenhiet, and the thick atmosphere they only last on the planet a near only few hours.

        "Venus is our closest planet to us besides Mars (sometimes) but does that mean that we should start to think about the possiblities of us landing there? The author of the article \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" is suggesting that we should go forward and try to study and hopefully go to Venus despite the dangers that are capable of happening. Venus may be our \"twin planet\", but it is very different from Earth. I think the author of this article supports this idea very much.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple reasons on why I think the author supports this article. One is because he talks about how Venus could have been. Venus is the most Earth-like planet that we know in our solar system but they don't exactly know if it once was like us or not. Astronomers think that Venus was once covered with oceans and it could even have supported forms of life. The author also talks about the features of Venus today. The author points out that the plant has some siliar features as us like valleys, mountains, and craters. The author ends the paragraph ,where he talks about this, with this sentence, \"The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making a mission both safe and scientifically productive.\" This makes me think that the author is trying to get us informed about the options that it could take to make this Venus situation be safer.\r\n\r\nThis information we know about the planet is very different than ours. One of the details that the author points out is that it has a thick atmosphere of amost 97% carbon dioxide. Another thing he says is that the clouds are made up of sufuric acid and that the tempature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "Although some might argue and have a different opinin, facial recognition is extreamly valuable in the class room. It can tell if a student is confused with the subject.

Computers in the schooling system is not an uncommon thing and it is used as a tool to teach students. The FACS program will be extreamly valuable to students. Every student learns at their own pace, where one student understands it right away another student might have difficulties with the subject that they are learning. With FACS this is no longer an issue, the computer system can read based off of facial expression if the student is understanding the subject or if they're having troubles. With this information the computer system can modify the teaching method or go back over parts that it belives the student is having troubles with. This goes along with if the student is slowly starting to get sidetracked and bored with the computer as most children do.",

Although the idea of a diverless car hasn't been fully develope, they predicted that it will be by the year 2020. In the my perspective I think the idea of a diverless car is bad because of the many problem it could cause.\r\n\r\nA diveless car is not exactly \"diverless\". In the ariticles it said, \" The car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel...human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over.\" This tells us that a diver still need to keep hold the of wheel and stay alert. The human still have to be on the look out and take over when their is a problem.\r\n\r\nA diverless car is not safe because it can bring technology problems and failuar. It said in the articles,\"New laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the diver or the manufacturer?\" This tell us that even if the diverless car is developed their will still be flaws. As it was mention in the article if someone got injured who would be at fault? If the person got injured they would blame it on the company and their would be problems.",
        "In the atricle \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, He tells us that new facial emotion technology is being developed. Technology like this would be valuable in the classroom because technology like this would tell us what a person's emotional expression. Technology like this can stop bad things that are caused by hate and sadness, like suicide.\r\n\r\nThe technology will create a 3-D computer model of the face being scanned. It will can the 44 major muscles in the human face. Muscles such as the frontalis pars lateralis muscle convays the emotion of being surprised, by raising the eyebrows. The human will convey many emotions at once, so by using video imagery, the software will be able to track the facial movements. The units created by the facial expressions will be compared to a face that show no emotions. But, humans can do the same emotions calculations on a regular basis by looking at a friend that is sad or mad, but it'd be difficult to explain the facial features being conveyed at certain time. A classroom computer will be able to scan a childs face and see if the student\r\n\r\nis bored or\r\n\r\nconfused, then the computer would act like a human instructor and modify the lessons to make it easier or less-boring to the student.",

The car will have a sensor the sensor has become advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. they also can cause the car to apply breaks on individule weelsand reduce power from the engine,allowing far better response and control than a human driver could mange alone. To make things more safe you are to be alert at all times its like going for a drive and relaxing but you know if you ever feel unsafe you can take over.\r\n\r\nThe cars are developing so fast not only google is making one as other car companys such as mercedes benz, audi, and nissan are putting in effort to make one by 2020. Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passagers, and pedestrians safe, and law enforcement know that the best way to get that is with an alert driver. the nlaw questions how they are going to get around the car such as if an axident happens. Who is reliable the driver or the maurfacture? even if traffic laws change new laws will need to be made in order to work with the cars. I belive if the car will make everyone more safe then it is worth it.\r\n\r\nIn the new cars drivers need to be aware as if anything goes wrond with the drive they are there to take over. why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver? Wouldent it get boring waiting for your turn to drive? i dont think so if it makes the roads safer then noting should be to much of a hassel.",
        "Students Expressions\r\n\r\nEveryday people are coming up with new technology to help the students learn in class. They give them computers and let them use phones and calculators. But the new software that can identify students emtions is going to help in so many diffent ways. The Facial Action Coding System will not only help the student but also help the teacher. If a student is feeling a certain emotion and doesn't want to participate in class that day then the teacher can help them due to their emotion. One other reason FACS could help, is with all the school shootings that are happening you could detect that a student was mad or sad because of a bully and help them before they do something disasterous. Another reason FACS could help is to stop a bully. If the software can dectect happiness it can detect hatred and it would be helpful in many schools if they could stop a bully before the bully found a victim. These are the some of the many reasons why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in school.\r\n\r\nIn many classrooms students hardly ever show up to school ready to work and learn. With the FACS teachers could use it to help those students and make sure they do their work so they student can suceed. Then on the other hand if a student is ready to work and very energetic the teacher can help them learn at their pace. Most students would agree and say that learning is hard if its not at your own pace. With FACS the teachers can learn what the students pace is and teach them accordingly.\r\n\r\nSchool shootings are becoming a regular thing in America and most of America feels the way I do; they need to stop. Students have emotions that lead them to committing acts of terror like this and the FACS would be able to detect if a student was sad or mad because of a bully. All the teacher or adult would have to do is talk to them and it could be avoided. The most effective way to stop a disaster of that magnitude is stop it before it happens. With the Facial Action Coding System it could easily be stopped.\r\n\r\nBullies are everywhere in schools: classroom, hallways, cafeteria, bathrooms, etc.",
        "Luke want others to participate in the program ''Seagoing Cowboys'' because when his firend told him to join the program, Luke knew that it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Based off the acticle I read, it says ,''Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China''. According to the text, Luke helped other people, and he wanted them to join in case they want to do the same thing. For example, Luke had turned 18 before arriving in Greece, like he could be drafted the the military service. he wanted people to join the program because they can experience adventures and visit many unique places. Luke also did not only help people but, caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy. Luke said,'' I'm grateful for the opportunity .'' The author stated, ''And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.''\r\n\r\nIt also says,\"It was1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).''

        "I believe that the face of Mars is just a natural landform because there is no such thing as aliens living upon us. Another reason is that Mars could've got hit by an astroid that came from the Astroid Belt, or maybe could've had a volcanic eruption. I know this because in the passage from the article it said, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing.... a natural land form.\"\r\n\r\nAnother passage form the article says, \"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.\" I believe that Mars had signs of life, and water in the passed, but now Mars has changed and is still changing over time. Mars does not have water anymore, but theories show thats there might some signs of living on Mars.",

And when we help them, a great feeling runs through our whole body and it is a feeling that you can never get anywhere else. When you join, you have the oppourtunity to see new and different places than you are use to. We got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. We also saw the Acropolis in Greece; took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy; toured an excevated castle in Crete; and saw the Panama Canal on our way to China.\r\n\r\nThe Seagoing Cowboys can have some fun after their work is done. On returning trips, after the animals had been unloaded frem their holds, the holds were used for games like baseball and volleyball. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.\r\n\r\nThe seagoing cowboys is a great oppurtunity for a lot of things. You help those in need, can see places you havent seen before, and play games with your friends.",
        "Driverless cars will be a great innovation in the automobile insustry, because driverless cars will be safer, more convenient, and possibly more fuel efficient.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars would make the world a lot safer, when dealing with automobiles. People die everyday in car accidents. With driverless cars, at first, of course, there will be complications regarding the sensing and accident prevention. After so long, with yearly upgrades and constant innovation, driverless cars' software should excel to the point of perfection, without any accident occurance. In paragraph 5, the test states, \"Sensors are nothing new, of course. in the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.\" This example shows that sensoring software ability is increasing, and as time goes by technologists learn more and more. Over time sensors will get better and better to the point where driverless cars are 100% safe.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are more convenient than cars with drivers. Cars with drivers require full attention from the driver. There are many cases, involving possibly injury, or even just fatigue, where a driver is forced into a position of either finding alternate transportation, or driving under dangerous circumstances. If a driver owns a driverless car, or has the accessability to a driverless \"taxi\", then whether fatigue, injured, or intoxicated, the driver, or now passenger, can safely be transported to their destination, without the result of an accident.",
        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author describes where the cars are now and how they are effecting society.\r\n\r\nEven, after reading the passage, I don't believe that driverless cars should be a reality right now.\r\n\r\nMaybe in a few years, when changes are made for safety precautions, but in the now, we can handle driving on our own.\r\n\r\nHaving the \"smart roads\" equipped with electrical cable or magnets, as General Motors and Berkeley engineers did in paragraph 3, would never work with rebuilding all new roads all over the world just for these cars.\r\n\r\nImagine the time and money spent just for these roads to be built.\r\n\r\nAnd what will happen once the passengers are on a road without these \"smart\" adaptions?\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the next version of this driverless car is to rather equip the car with sensors and not the road itself as the Toyata Prius did in paragraph 4.\r\n\r\nBut no matter how many sensors, lasers, or recievers you have on this driverless car, artificial intelligence will never be as smart as human intelligence.\r\n\r\nWhat will happen when a deer jumps out from a field, a pedestrian rides his bike, a child's ball bounces out from her yard, or a pothole comes near comes bouncing from her yard? Will the sensors and lasers notice the change and react as fast a human would?\r\n\r\nEven if there is still a driver in the seat, as said in paragraph 8, what will keep their attention on the road and not fixated on their phone or other passengers?\r\n\r\nNo amount of buzzing or flashing lights will get the attention of the driver to whatever accident may occur quick enough to make a change.\r\n\r\nIf anything, the displays will make the driver panic in such a way that will make their safety decline further.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are especially targeted to keep those who would normally drive while under the influence of alchohol and others safe from them.\r\n\r\nBut once again, what if something should come between the car and where the car wants to go?",
        "I know that people are saying that this is proof that aliens inhabit Mars, but trust me, this is not proof. I wish this was proof. It's exactly what we need to hear right now. It's exactly what we've been needing to hear for years. We wan't to find evidence of life on Mars, so why would be hide any signs from you?\r\n\r\nIf you still don't belive me, look closer at it. Some images the face is more clear than others. That means that the eyes and nose that you see are just shadows. Aliens wouldn't make an artifact that only looks like a face from certain angles. They would want it to stand out.\r\n\r\nSome of you say that the alien markings are hidden behind the wispy clouds. Well, we checked again at a time when it was clear and you could see everything fine. There were no alien markings. Like I said, if there were we would have been extatic. The whole world would have known about it within a few days.\r\n\r\nI know it has become a huge pop icon, and I'm sorry yo ruin this for you, but it has to be done. It's just a landform.

        "Wow, from the mar really look like humans face. It have eyes,nose, and mouth. It weird that on mar there is nothing and it shape like that is really weird. Most people think there is alien who live there do. They say it maybe it for living thing for alien. I think it just a natural land form because there is no alien monument.\r\n\r\nFirst, The face of the mar really is popular for other. It even appear on hollywood film, books,magazines, and radio. Maybe it just not close enough to see if it flat or it like mountian. It show a lot of stuff going on on mar. Mar is really history for people in may 24,2001.\r\n\r\nNext, I think it just natural land form because on the shadow it look like pyramid. If you look at the shadow and you can see it not it have to much pointing on the top. The eyes waht they call it might be the whole for some water. the mouth can be just a crack on it.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we can go look closer scientist NASA might catural n tell.

        "I think it would be cool to have a driverless car. I would say that even in a driverless car, the driver should still be able to take control when needed. I think we should keep it to where the driver could take control whenever, because of road construction. I would say that a driverless car, with also control of a driver would be fine.\r\n\r\nI would say it's fine because, Google has drove driverless cars under specific conditions since 2009. They have driven more than hald a million miles without a crash. I think they are saying it is safe. Also, the Google cars aren't actually driverless because, they are alerted when to do something. These alerts are for example, when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, as in roadwork or accidents.\r\n\r\nI think it would be cool to have one when you need to answer an emergency call. It will be safe to answer the call, because if you need to take control it will alert you. If someone was injured, I would say it would be the manufacturers fault. I would say it's the manufacturers fault, because they are the ones who made it, they were in control of making the car the whole time.\r\n\r\nI would say a driverless car would be safe, in only some conditions. These conditions would be, when the car alerts the driver when they need to step in and drive.",

        "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" the author gives many good reasons as to why driverless cars are the next big thing. Driverless cars will have driver alert features to them but the question is will they function correctly and not fail us causing an even bigger mitsake? According to cofounder Sergey Brin drdiverless cars are the next big thing for the future. It is no longer flying cars it is now driverless cars. Brin is a believer that a driverless car will fundamently change the world. As exciting and wonderful a driverless car sounds its is not a good idea. Technology brings many new wonders and fasinations, but the technology that will be used for a driverless car will eventually fail the driver.\r\n\r\nA driverless car seems very intresting and many good ideas and opinions are being published to the public but will the true story about driverless cars ever make it through to the public? No because the manufactuer will always find something good to say about the car whenever the public says something negative. A driverless car will be another mistake to our generation of new ideas. The author of the article said in paragraph 7, \" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. \" Then later it also stated, \" This means the human driver must remain alert. \" The human driver needs to remain alert at all times because we will never know when the driverless car will need human assistance. Leading to the fact the already the car hasnt been made but they already know that the car will need human skills at times. Already the cars technology cannot be trusted. As the human driver you will get distracted or may fall asleep. You may not even know the car is going to need assistance at times and before you know it your at risk for a crash the driverless car haas caused. Drivers will also rely to much on their car because they will thik it is so up to date on technology that it wont fail the driver. The human driver may go out to a party one night and get drunk. The human driver won't care because the car will take them back home safe and sound as they were told. Will it really though? Along the way the technology may stop working and before you know it the drunk driver will be behind the wheel not only putting himself in danger but everybody else on the road.\r\n\r\nSome other issues with the car may also occur. For example the driver alert functions may stop working out of nowhere. In the acrticle it stated, \" GM has devloped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in dnager. \" The vibrating chair may stop functioning correctly and the driver will not know. The driver may not also know how to properly use it and may put the car in a mode that isnt supposed to be in at the moment. Who still reads the instructions? That is a very low number and many people just jump straight into using the object.",
        "When you join the Seagoing Cowboys, you join a year of adventure. When you join, you get to take care of animals like horses, cattle, and more.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,\" he says. So was taking a godola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.\" Imagine seeing beautiful cities that you always wanted to see, right in front of your eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, when you join, you get to have fun.

        "Why do I think that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens? I think that ,because on April 5, 1998 Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the Face on Mars ten times sharper than the orginal picture in 1976 by the Viking. My second reason why I don't believe that aliens created the Face on Mars, is becase on April 8, 2001 Malin's team took a picture of the Face on Mars. Not only is believing that the Face on Mars was created by aliens is illogical, but many pictures have been taken, there is still not a single sign of aliens.\r\n\r\nMy first reason why I don't think the aliens created the Face on Mars is because the MOC team snapped a photo of the Face on Mars ten times sharper, so you could see more clearly. You could see clearer than the orginal Viking photos. When the web surfers saw the picture, all they could see was a natural landform. Not any sign of aliens. My piont is that the clearer the pictue gets, the less it reveals that aliens created the Face on Mars.\r\n\r\nAccording to the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars'', \"Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'' Garvin told them. Compared to the 1976 photo taken by the Viking, the newer camera spans 1.56 meters for each pixel.",

And I know the all the supersticios people who think it's \"Alians\" would say that nothing that I'm saying proves anything but with the new camera that we had if there would have been any housing, which there would have had to be to construct such a monument, thene we would have seen it.\r\n\r\nNow that i have told my side of the story everyone can calm down.",

        "Is the use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System valuable to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom?. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'alto, the author describes how a new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promissing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a sudent is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it hepls the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them.\r\n\r\nSchool brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the techers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or thewy might be confused but afraid to speak up so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". It also states \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor\". By this evidence , the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored; this would allow them to think throught about changing a new method to teach so the studetns don't get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The mayority of students nowdays don't care about school or just don't get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don't bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success but they don't implement it, so what is best than a new tehnology to help out a little.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time.. Wouldn't it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles\". It also states \"The software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)\".",
        "In this article called,\"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" it explains an advanced technology that can identify what humans are feeling on the inside. This technology is attention grabbing and seems so futuristic. The Facial Action Coding System claims to have lots of uses. I think that this new technology could be very useful in a learning environment. The Facial Action Coding System could benefit a classroom setting by being able to tell if the student is completely understanding the material, being able to tell if a student if bored and zoning out, and by seeing if you are enjoying the lesson.\r\n\r\nA lot of times students do not understand the information that is being pushed on them and are too afraid to ask questions. Teachers can't read a students mind, and teachers aren't a computerized system to identify if a student is understanding the concepts in class. Students are often too afraid and embarrassed to ask questions in class and for that sake, they just don't do it. From personal experience as a student, this can be frustrating and doesn't benefit my education. The new Facial Action Coding System could change the way people learn on a whole new level by being able to identify confusion, and then breaking down the concepts more. Having a system that can identify if students are confused could be extremely beneficial on lots of different levels.",
        "I think that driveless cars are great because for example say if your on the road and your hands start to get tired you can relax and let your car do all the driving and driveless cars can also be good for people with arthoritist or people who have bad hands regardless of the causes.\r\n\r\nI think driveless cars are good because if your on the road and your hands start to get tired the car can do all of the work until you feel like driving again but you still have to be cautious and be aware of what your cars are doing. The car to me sounds great because in the story it quotes \" The combination of all this input is necessary for the driveless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. So basically if you have a driveless car and your not holding the wheel the car would still drive perfect do to it having the skill that make the car drive like a human is\r\n\r\nbehind the wheel. These cars also have problems you have to be ready and grab the wheel if your car lights blink indicating that you are about to hit someone or something.\r\n\r\nDriveless cars would also be good for people to have arthoritist because if the car drives it's self the person behind the wheel wouldn't really have to do anything only when the time comes. The story indicates that the people in the car entertainment are trying to make driveless cars fun because i know if someone just sitting in there cars doing nothing but listening to music they would get bored but i also know people with arthoritist would love these cars because they will not have to use there hands they could just sit back and listen to music. Driveless cars can be perfect for many people of all kinds and they can help in the society.\r\n\r\nDriveless cars can also be great for people that wants to have fun\r\n\r\nif they dont feel like driving.",
        "In my opinion the use of the Facial Action Coding System computer is valuable for reading emotions. Stated in paragraph 6, they show an example of when and how it works, so smiling at an ad that apppears on the screen another like it will appear, and frowning at that particular ad the next ad will be diffrent. Showing that these computers work at identifing emotions in diffrent ways is amazing. In paragraph 7 showing that the emotions used cant be identified on an regular home PC computer because the process is too complex, is also showing how the FACS computers is the real thing. How it calculates what emotions is shown in the painting of Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci by the specific percentages in paragraph 1 gives us a more stable idea of how it works, it doesn't just gives us the bland emotion of happy or sad, but gives all of the emotions that might've been happening with Mona Lisa while getting painted. This is why i believe the Facial Action Coding System computer is valuable for reading human emotions.",
        "\"Skrt!\" \"Boom!\" That could be you in a car accident. Car accidents are really high in america and thats terrible. Many people believe that driverless cars will help reduce accidents. They won't reduce accidents they will only increase it because technology fails alot, it wont have fast reactions, and drives wont see whats going on.\r\n\r\nTodays technology is great, but it fails alot. Once they perfect technolgy then maybe they could use a driverless car, meanwhile they shouldnt use it. I think its a great idea and descisons that some states wont allow or test driverless cars. They can hurt someone by technology turning off. What if someone hacks and goes and controls the car? People need to realize that its a bad idea.\r\n\r\nHow can a driverless car react? A human would have to be awake and see whats going on. If a car spuns out the car wont stop because it wont see it and its only focus is getting the human to the destination point. Humans rely on technology way too much. Its not safe, but it is usefull dont get me wrong.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing is that driver will trust the car and they will just sit back and relax. They wont see whats going on because they trust the driverless car. What if your running late and the car goes only its speed limit you wont make it to your job or the plave you need to be.",
        "The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is able to suggest and back up their claim of Venus being a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers by stating facts showing how science and technology will help us in the pursuit of exploring to Venus. They gets us concerned by stating the perrils of exploring venus. Then they state why the audience should be interested in exploring Venus, and proceeds to counter the perrils by stating technological advancements being made to lessen the extreme environment on Venus.\r\n\r\nThe author shows the perrils by first stating the dangers and compare them to intense atmospheres on Earth, such as how the ground temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and would instantly melt most metals. Another example that he gives would be when they states that the gravitational pull of Venus would crush a submarine that was meant to explore the deepest depths of the ocean at Earth. One more example of this would be when says that staying above it is still a danger because of how hot and unbearable it would be. Those are the situations that he has listed.\r\n\r\nAfter saying all the dangers of exploring Venus the author decides to mention why scientists are still attempting to explore the dangerous planet. An example would be that Venus is very much like Earth. In the article the author mentions Venus and Earth having many of the same features, such as mountains and valleys as well as evidence showing Venus possibly containing water and oceans. Another thing the author tells us is that the planets orbit at different times, so at times Earth may be closest to Venus, and other times we are closer to Mars. Those are all reasons why scientists wish to explore Venus further.\r\n\r\nThe author, after having told us the conditions and reasons to explore Mars goes further. The author then states technological advancements being made to help survive the conditions on Venus to obtain samples and such.",
        "Have you ever been in your car and thought I wish my car could drive by its self? Well you must have a fairy godmother because your wish just came true. They have started to design driverless cars now, they are very efficient. They are a lot easier to drive as well. Driverless cars make everyones life easier and they need to be manufactured.\r\n\r\nThese driverless cars can actually limit your risk of having an accident. The cars have a sensor and they sense when an object is too close. The author shows this by \"Those sensors had become moe advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers.\" This shows how these cars can better keep not just you but also your family safe. These cars also have auto brakes which can better prevent collisions. The author gives examples of this in \" Can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine.\" This shows how the car can prevent accidents from happening.\r\n\r\nOn top of that these driverless cars are a lot easier to handle or control. On way they are easier is by being able to navigate through work zones by itself. the author shows this in this excerpt \" They can steer...\" This shows that they can steer by themselves. Another way is by going around accidents. The author states that the veichle will be able to go around a proplem it faces.\r\n\r\nIf that's not enough to convince you its a good idea then they also make drivers more alert when they're on the road.",
        "Student emotions can sometimes be hard to read. Students experience many different emotions everday throughout school. Some students may be happy and excited about school while others are bored and drowsy. New technology has been developed called the Facial Action Coding System. This system enables computers to indentify human emotions. This technology would be very benefiticial to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.\r\n\r\nWith this new tech teachers would have the ability to read there students emotional expressions when they are giving a lesson. If the students emotional responses are boredom and drowsiness. Then the teacher will know they should change what they are doing so the students become more alert and interested.\"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. If a student is becoming lost or dosent understand the material the computer will recognize that and the teacher will be able to stop and help that student.\r\n\r\nThe use of this tech will allow teaching in the classroom to become more efficent and if a student is struggling teachers will be able to recognize that quicker.",
        "Have you ever actually wondered if aliens exist? i bet you have well,everyone has there own definition on a alien. But who really is to say they arent from here on out ill telll you why i think aliens created such a face.\r\n\r\nfirst there were alien markings. from what i know about aliens there very smart. if aliens are smart why not blame it on them. and even in paragraph 8 i qoute it sais \"alien markings were hidden by a haze\" why wouldnt an alien make a face if they have nearly as much intelligence then yes. id have to say the aliens mine as well have done it.\r\n\r\nsecond in the photo from 1998 the photo is very clear it is a face but in the photo from 2001 it is cracked and doesnt nearly look the same maybe a alien could have drew that or really anything not that i have evidence but im just saying if it looks like that. that looks like the creation of a non human. but who really knows.\r\n\r\nbut you also have to think this a is a nother planet so why wouldnt it be a aliens creation.\r\n\r\nso through all ive said what i mean is through a humans creation we are very intelligent, and if aliens are anything like us id say they would have a great chance of creating that. this is another planet so i mean if they did and they lived thier then i mean thats were they live thats there house thier art.",
        "Facial Action Coding at schools?\r\n\r\nClass rooms with , Facial Action Coding , ? I think for a classroom with Facial Action Coding would not be such a good idea in a classroom. There are many reasons why it's not a good idea. There are many emotions in a student in a class room that a student wouldn't want to be recogize . For many student there always someone who is in love and does not want anyone to figure it out . In paragrahp 3 it tells readers that \" happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness\" can all be shown with the Facial Action Coding System. The student might be sad because the girl wouldn't go out on a date with him and show that emotion in class.\r\n\r\nFor many students I honstley think alot of students would not like it . Another reason why it would not be a good idea to put this new Facial Action Coding System in many classroom is it might distract many of the students. Alot of classroom students are already going through alot of things like stressing, grades, finals, and credits. They wouldn't want that to be pick up by the system for a example a student could be really sad about his grades and doen't want anyone to know. Our minds are only safe place to go where anyone can't go.\r\n\r\nOther places would be a better option for the Facial Action Coding like hostiptals and nursing homes. A good reason why I think it would be a good idea at a hostpital because it can help alot of people that are sick and feeling pain. In paragraph 3 it say the system can pick up happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.",
        "The pursuit of the dangers includethings such as gravity,temperature,air pressure. The gravity because of in paragraph 5 the author made an example to a vehicle probably a space rover hovering above the surface. The text states that \"Just like jet airlplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms,a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions but staying up and out of there way\". Bascaily saying that the vehicle would have hard time to stay on the ground. The temperature would be as The text states in paragraph 5 \"around 170 degrees fahrenheit\". Temperatures would be scoiling hot. Air pressure would be another danger because you can only take so much pressure before you got to back to the surface. As the text states it once again in paragraph 5 \" would be close to sea level \". I do agree with the author as he says in the text \"Not easy conditions,but survivable for humans. There has been some movies about living on harsh conditions where astronauts had to live on planets with harsh conditions.",
        "I think the development of these cars would be a good idea,\r\n\r\nFirstly, the cars would use half of the fuel so\r\n\r\nIt would be better for the environment .Also, It would produce less pollution.People who care about the nature would buy these cars, helping the process to get rid of the pollution.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\r\n\r\nAlthough,none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless so It means that if we keep developing these technology we can reach the point of cars driving without a human being.Also, these cars remains alert to the human driver to be ready to take over when the situation requires, so people can manage the situation.\r\n\r\nThirdly,It's safer in all the aspects.Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.\r\n\r\nThe way that Driverless cars use the technology is increible, If the\r\n\r\nDriverless cars can do this now, who knows what they will do.",
        "Everyone shows emotion at some point in their lives. Whether it be joy, sorrow, or even anger everyone has expressed their emotions in one way or another. Now there is a computer software that can recognize six emotions. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom using this technology is valuable because it could tell the instructor when a student is confused, it could modify the lesson, and it could help people feel more empathy for each other.\r\n\r\nStudents can become confused very quickly when an instructor is teaching about something. This computer software could stop this from happening and overall help students have a better experience at school when trying to learn. In paragraph six Dr. Huang talks about how this could revolutionize a classroom, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" This would overall help a teacher know when someone is confused so they can help them after class or talk to them more in-depth about the lesson. This invention could hep out many of students that find lessons to be very hard and don't know how to do whatever the instructor is teaching. This software could also modify the lesson that an instructor is teaching so that it is easier for a student to grasp.\r\n\r\nMany teachers present day don't necessarily care if the students are learning what they are teaching, but just the fact that they are teaching it gives them a clear concious. This computer program could give the teachers an alert saying that someone isn't getting the lesson because they are confused with a certain topic that the teacher talked about during the class. They could then modify their lesson so that it is easier for everyone to learn.",
        "Can technology really sense emotion? Can your computer tell if you're happy or sad? These are some of the questions that Facial Action Coding System is attempting to answer. Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is vaulable. It can be used to keep students engaged, active and eager to learn. Adjusting a learning program to what a student finds appealing will help them have a positive connotation with learning.\r\n\r\nUsing programs like the Facial Action Coding System to read students emotional expressions is a very vaulable tool. It can help keep students engaged and active. In todays schools, it doesn't even come as a suprise when you hear that a student fell asleep in class. Students who are not engaged in a learning activity tend to fall asleep or do something that is non-productive. This causes them to miss out on a possibly important lesson. In paragraph six Dr. Huang notes \"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.\" Using a computer to detect when a student is becoming bored is a vaulable tool because it can change the lesson, prevent the student from loosing interest and missing out on a lesson. With a program able to identify when a student becomes bored or uninterested, more students will stay on task and become engaged in the lesson.\r\n\r\nIn modern schools, technology is being intergrated at an incresing rate. At Fishers High School every student is required to have a learning device such as a laptop or iPad. More classes are beginning to take teaching online. Without having a real instructor, students can easily become bored or distracted.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph six, Dr. Huang is quoted saying \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" Dr. Huang is referring to the Facial Action Coding System being able to detect student emotion to gear the lesson towards what is more appealing to them.",
        "Is it a natural formed face or is it made by aliens? I'm a scientist telling you that it is a natural form rock. There are a couple reasons on why it is not made my aliens. It will be provided in the next three paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe first reason is, that we here at NASA caught an image of a face in 1976 by viking 1. At first we thought it was an alien or a face made by aliens. Then in 2001 we found the same picture of the face, but got a better veiw and a better picture quialty of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the first one. Whe the imaged appeared on JPL web site, reavealing that is was a natural landform, not a face made by aliens.\r\n\r\nWe did some more tests to be sure that the landform was really a landform or if it was a face made by aliens. We figured out that is was a natural landform.\r\n\r\nThat is was not an alien monument after all. We tried to find it again but it was hard.\r\n\r\nThere are no such thing as an alien.",

This program can detect how you are felling and in what precentages. In the following paragraphs they will talk about if we should or should not read students faces to make the classroom experience more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWell to start off the technology has decoded the Mona Lisa smile.

The author explains the goods and the bads of going to Venus. It is a worthy pursuit because with studying and evaluating about Venus the U.S can make huge changes and make a new discoverys.\r\n\r\nVenus is a worthy pursuit because in paragraph 4 it explains how Venus is the most earth like planet that anyone has ever seen. In paragraph it also explains how long ago venus used to be covered with oceans and many various forms of life. Astronomers also say that venus to this day have features that analogou to those on earth. Despite the very cool things you can see in Venus it comes with a risk. NASA has come up with a possible solution. In paragraph 5 it explains how NASA is coming up with ideas to get closer to venus without any dangerous things that can happen.

        "Driveress cars have developed a lot in advancing to their purpose, but it doesnt actually replace the driver. Many cars have been developed and tested to see if driverless cars reduce the amount of accidents. Accidents will always be something that will have to be considered. I do not support driverless cars because there will be argumental faultry when it comes to an accident, drivers actually have to be more dependent on the car, and the price of the car would not be accessible at first.\r\n\r\nWho is really to blame for accidents that happen by driverless cars? Manufacturers certainly do not want to be blamed for something they did not do, but they did make the car. The driver does not want to be blamed for an accident that the \"driver\"less car did. If driverless cars are to actually happen, there will be a lot more lawsuits coming to the manufacturer becauase they did not actually follow through with the meaning of driverless cars. That is to be said that the manufacturer has to tell the buyer of the car all of the components that actually need to be taken into place to resist from getting into an accident. Therefore, if the driver actually has to do work to resist a \"driverless\" car from getting into an accident, then what is the point of buying a car that you will have to watch over and make sure no accidents actually occur?\r\n\r\nDrivers now are actually driving the cars, meaning they are in control. When the driver is in control, they only have to watch over thereselves andthe driving of others. Defensive driving has been the tactic for many years to resist accidents. What would it be for driverless cars? To resist any accident you actually need to make sure your car is doing the right thing.",

There are many dangers as well, but I belive the pros outweigh the cons in this situation.",
        "Control your life or let it control you. Since technology has improved significantly since the past decades, In the article \"Driveless Cars Are Coming\" humans are able to create vehicles that drive themselves. They have their pros and cons but the cons out-shape the pros. Driveless cars are lethal, illegal, and time consuming to manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe first reason on why driveless cars are lethal is that they are not tested fully and can injure the driver very severely if not handled right. This is evident in paragraph 9 where the author states, \"manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe.\" This is a perfect example of how the driveless cars are still unstable and should be tested. Overall, companies still need to improve on some aspects on the driveless car to have it be a safe to use.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that the utilization of driveless cars on testing is illegal. Evidence to support this claim is that the author states in paragraph 9, \"As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.\" This makes the invention difficult to find it's short comings and hard to sell. More evidence is found that alot of people can get in trouble due to this technology failing, which is found in paragraph nine again, \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" This can both harm them because of the injury and the company's reputation. Overall, driveless cars are suited to test because of the law.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last reasoning on while driveless cars are suited for the market is because of time.",
        "Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it has proved that it is a very challenging place to examine more closely,so because of this they find that sudying Venus is a worthy pursuit no matter how dangerous it could be.\r\n\r\nOne reason why Venus is a worthy pusuit because it is one of the most chalenging places to examine. In the article it said,\"While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vintage point of Earth,it is proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.\" this meant that even though we are able to see venus it is very challenging to examine closely.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why Venus is a worthy pursuit is because venus is the closest planet to earth which makes it easier to get there but the problem is Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to examine and study even though it is Very close to Earth. In the Article it said,\"Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challanging planet for humans to study despite its proximity to us.\" this means that even though Venus is very close to us it is still a very challenging planet to study.\r\n\r\nOne final reason why Venus is a worthy pursuit is because astrononers were fascinated by Venus because it may have been the most Earh-like planet in our solar system. It says,\" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\"",
        "Drivereless cars might be a big thing in the future, but are they really worth it? Could driverless cars actually be more dangerous than an individual driving a car themselves? I think it could be, think about it, a car driving itself, theres only a thousand things to wonder about the dangers it could have behind it.\r\n\r\nIn the article, the author states that driverless cars can \"steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notfiy the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through worl zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" Some individual drivers already don't pay attention while they're driving themselves, becuase they're too busy texting, talking on the phone, or messing with the radio. So what happens if the driverless car needs to get the human drivers attention, but they aren't paying attention to their surroundings? Anything could happen, the driver could get into an accident of its own, and could face possible dealth.\r\n\r\nCar accidents are a huge thing around the world right now, especially with teen drivers.

        "Cars today are driving closer and to being able to drive on their own. This can change the way people live and how people use tranportation in a positive way. Even though they aren't entirely \"driverless\" and still need a driver it's still a step in that direction. Driverless cars would take over public transportion system, create less accidents, and help people who can't drive well.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are esstientally going to be the future public transportation. The cars will end up taking the postions of taxis and even buses. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisons a future where these cars will offer much more flexiblity while cutting the useage of fuel by half.\r\n\r\nThese self drivng cars will also be safer for others on the road reducing the chances of a crash. Car companies have taken extreme precautions with these machines fitting them with senors all over the cars. Google has taken the idea into its own hands with some companies like Toyota. They've modified a Toyota Prius and have outfitted it with a postiton-estimating sensor on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted ner the review mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. These sensors will apply brakes and reduce power from the engine so that the driver at hand can take over.\r\n\r\nOf course these driverless cars will need a passenger that a operate the car in case of an emergancy. In 2013, BMW announced a development of the \"traffic Jam Assistant\", which allows the cars to handle driving functions at speed up to 25 mph.",
        "I dont agree with this idea of driverless cars becuase my first thought when I hear \"Driverless Cars\" is i woldnt be safe. Thats my concern; safty in the car. If the car doesnt require you to drive then something in the wires and sensors could malfunction.The car could sense something and break quickly and could cause accisents or cause the person in the vhecial to get hurt. In this article they say that the car would need a whole lot of sensors, on the left rear wheel a rotating sensor on the roof etc. If you ask me this sounds like i would be riding down the street in a space ship. It says they tested a car on an embedded track with electrial cables, thats not safe. Also it says it would be a massive amount of money to make these roads. Who has all that money to comtribute?\r\n\r\nThey say that the cars arent truley driverless, they still alert the driver to take over when certian things happen. So whats the point of a driverless car if its not technacally driverless? Even they ask themselves that in the article.\r\n\r\nThey say driverless cars are the new thing but recently BMW has came out with the \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" meaning you have to keep your hands on the wheels. This is the total opposite of driverless cars. I would choose this meathod. Speaking of BMW other high-end cars like: Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan are plannng to have driverless cars by 2020. If driverless cars are as safe as they say then why are they only happening in expensive/ High-end cars.",
        "Driverless cars are a good idea, but it has its flaws. Driverless are more prone to get into an accidents than cars with people actually driving them. First, the car is made up of a lot of sensors. The sensor on the roof is the most important one, and if that sensor gets damaged in any way the car couldn't drive itself. If someone was taveling on the road in that car, and the Rotating sensor stopped working then they would have to take over , and drive themselves. Also if a malfunction happened on a highway it can cause car crashes and such. While there are problems about the sensor privacy needs to be addressed too.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is a big thing too the \"Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining foucused on the road\" this shows that the manufactureres are watching people as they drive. People in the car would have no privacy cause the manufacturers are watching them. While privacy is a issue buying that can't drive itself is an issue too.\r\n\r\nThe car still \"requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents\" this shows that the driver must stay alert while its driving. Manufactueres have developed things to get people's attention whenever a problem occurs. Its like why would you pay for a driverless car that you still have to drive?",

        "Everyday people die in car crashes with them driving manually. So why would they trust a vehicle with a computer programming the vehicle? I believe that the driverless cars would be a tragic disaster in the world because, there could possibly be just as much car crashes. For example, Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, said that they would have to put sensors everywhere on the vehicle. What if one of the sensors were to brake or just go out while driving a person? Or if little kids were riding their bycicles on the streets and get hit by one of the vehicles?\r\n\r\nThese vehicles would not make a good impact on the world. Yes, it would be fun to experiment with but it wouldn't be when the vehicle goes dead on the streets and you have to get out and walk the rest of your destination. It could be possible that the GPS they were talking about putting in the car could go out and run a red light or stop sign and seriously injure or kill the passengers.\r\n\r\nHave they ever thought about a tire going out on a highway? You not having anywhere to go? Or having to wait on someone to come and get you? I believe that when they say the google car always lets you know if you are going to get into a car crash they are over-exagerating. Because, when you are driving you always have this think called a blind spot. If you have a blind spot then there is no way that the vehicle can see everything.\r\n\r\nThey say that the car can only speed up to 25mph, but when you are driving on\r\n\r\nhighway that isn't really helpful. Or if you are in a hurry to get somewhere that wouldn't be helpful either. The author says in paragraph 7 line 3-4 that they have special sensors to make sure that the person is holding on to the wheel when driving.",
        "Could you imagine everyone in the world driving in a vehicle that could control where and when you go somewhere? I think it would be absolute chaos. I couldn't imagine driving in a vehicle that could take control on it's own, It would be way to skeptical for me. I strongly disagree about driverless cars.\r\n\r\nFirst, driverless cars are not 100% durable nor safe. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, stated that \"General motors created a concept car that would run on a special track\". That track for these driverless cars were embedded with electrical cables that sent radio signals to the front of the car. In reality, no roads have any electrical currents running through them to make any car more secure. It's illegal in many states to even test computor cars because this company hasn't proved their car reliably safe. Driverless cars are in my opinion, not safe.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in this whole artical, I didn't hear one thing about the driverless car being able to sense any size animal. Animals cause many accidents or deaths in the U.S. Animals are dangerous when you're driving, and many are unpredictable. This car has lots of little gagets and electronics in it, I think it should at least help you predict or let you know when a animal is approaching.",

This technology is supposedly able to help find the emotions of a human and how they feel by recognizing their facial features and muscles.\r\n\r\nThis new technology FACS, known as the Facial Action Coding System reads the facial features and the way humans use their muscles in their faces to recognize their emotional state, whether they be happy, sad etc. This new technology would not benefit our society today for the reason that we have careers and jobs in understanding humans emotional state, the time, money and effort spent in learning this would all be replaced by a robot or new technology, this causes jobs to be lost and people that spent their lives and money learning this career are out of a job because of a technology. FACS is good in a way to survey an area of people but not a necessity to the world today.\r\n\r\nAlthough reading a students emotional state in a classroom is a good benefit and way to figure out whether or not that student needs more help or is the reason he/she are a disturbance in class or failing in a classroom. I believe it is a good thing to have at a school because kids today hide their emotions, and avoid socialization because of their emotional state, and if we have that today in our classrooms we could help kids grades rise, fights lessen, and even could stop bullying with knowing that a kid is in fear, why is he/she in fear? or a kid is sad? etc. These things help us understand what to do in order to keep the school safe and student happy in the classroom.\r\n\r\nIf the FACS is able to read students emotions and detect if that human is sad, happy etc. then yes this technology would be a great resource in the classroom or school today because of so many things happening over the world teachers and their staff should be able to use this technology to undestand their students emotions in order to help them in a classroom and figure out how to help them in academics for a better future. The article in this passage talks about how the FACS can even adress emotional views from a picture that dated back to the era when Da Vinci was painting, and this even could give us what emotion the Mona Lisa out out and how Da Vinci used facial features to depict emotion in his paintings, this could bring out the views of people back in the 1800s or even earlier.\r\n\r\nThough I am not for this technology for the fact that we do not need a machine or computer telling us what state of emotion were in, it could be a great use in the school board today with all the violence and cyber communication that happens.",
        "When one reaches 16 years of age, they have the ability to drive on their own in the streets but now, will one really need a driver's license? Google is in the process of making their own self driving cars to eventually put them out intothe world for everyone to have. These cars may have its good points but it also has its bad points. Ultimately, I think developing these cars are a bad thing to do. These cars may cause more lack of effort but also they cause danger to citizens, danger to the driver, and more problems for the company. You could even say one crash could cause an explosion.\r\n\r\nIn the text of \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", the author talks about the point of cars being developed by Google that do not need drivers to drive. The gives some positive aspects of the idea, but also negative. I think the negative rules out the positive. The text says \"even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or manufacturer?\" This point brings up the problems of the manufacturer/company, but also brings up the fact that an incident can in fact happen. \"In the case of an accident...if the technology fails\" are the points that show technology is not perfect, it has its flaws, so having technology take the wheel is just as bad as a person and maybe worse. \"traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars.\" States even say that the driverless cars must be restricted because of lack of safety. This quote shows that the driverless cars are overall not safe to civilians and the ones who, apparently, ride in it.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars may sound like a benefit but technology has the same what if risk as a person does. In the year of 2015, there has been more car crashes then there has been by far and that is because of texting and driving.",
        "Since 2009, google has been developing driverless cars. Cofounder of google, Sergey Brin, believes that with these cars it would \"fundamentally change the world\". More than a million people have droven the cars without any accidents but that driverless car isnt fully driverless it still requires the driver to take over at some points. I agree that driverless cars are the best new cars of the future that should be accepted.\r\n\r\nGoogle should work to make this car available to the public around the world because this new generation depends on technology. This new technology also makes people feel safer while driving on the road. In the passage it says\", Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors....The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel(5).\" The cars are programmed to go by human actions which may guarantee fewer accidents and crahes.",
        "The developmeant of driverless cars can be dangerous for our society. In 2009, Google made a car that could drive by itself, in certain conditions. These cars have been banned in certain states, it's against the law to test drive them in these states. How are we supposed to know how these cars do in other conditions if states have them banned for their states safety. Driverless cars can only assist us in driving not drive the car itself.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950's. General Motors made a car that could drive on its own, on a special test track. This special test track was \"embedded with eletrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever on the front end of the car\"(Driverless Cars Are Coming). This Track could easily stop the car if needed, but we dont know how it would do out in the real world with other people. There are alot of sensors on the car. On Google's modified Toyata Prius, There are sensors on the left rear wheel, a sensor on the roof. a camera ner the rearview mirror, automotive radar sensors and a GPS. Sure having a lot of sensors on a carwould help the car pick up motion around it, but what if somthing happened to the car, one of the sensors broke out, the the car wouldn't be able to pick up movement around the car. BMW, a car manufactuer, developed \"traffic jam assistant\"(Driverless Cars Are Coming). The car with traffic jam assistant can handle any driving function at 25 mph as long as the driver keeps their hands on the wheel. The car can steer by itself, which isn't safe because the car might see the need to turn itself in one direction and accidently hit a car.",
        "I beleive that the development of self driving cars would better our future. The introduction of self driving cars is a positive because they give the driver more freedom to do other productive things, they still give the driver some control over the car incase bad condition come up, and they use many different sensors to ensure the passengers safety.\r\n\r\nSelf driving cars give people the freedom to do more productive things instead of driving. This is helpful because people could get more work done in the car. Which in some cases people can commute many hours, giving them valuable time to work. A concern with this could be distracting the driver from being alert incase the car needs assistance. Although as stated in the article \"Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up display. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over\". This means that drivers could use the systems already put in the cars that are regulated by the car itself so that if there is an emergency, the car can shut down the devices.\r\n\r\nThe cars are smart enough to know when they should let the passeneger take over. This is important because it shows you that the cars still give you control in certain situations, and they only drive in conditions that would otherwise be easy. Stated in the article, it says \"In 2013, BMW announced the development of \"Traffic Jam Assistant\". Th car can handle driving functions at speeds of up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless\". This means that if the car starts to lose control or go into bad conditions, the passenger can take over.\r\n\r\nThe cars that are modified to be self driven are highly equipped with technology to help the car.",
        "Over time, we learned venus advanteges, and disadvanteges. Studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The more challeging it is to study venus, the more people want to explore.\r\n\r\nFirst about 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus. What's more challeging is the clouds of high corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmopshere. In venus the temperture average over 800 degree. Which is also more than we experenice in our plant.\r\n\r\nSecond Also Researchers would not be able to take any samples of whatever sort. This would be diffecult for researchers to contine with the mission. In order to get far more information is to find a way to get up close and personal to venus even if it is risky.\r\n\r\nLastly striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the plantet itself, also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally discoveries.",
        "Some people think that the face on mars was created by aliens. This essay will tell you that the face is just another one of Mars mesa or butte.\r\n\r\nThe face on mars was not created by aliens because there is no life on mars. The face looked like an alien artifact because the images were not sharp so you can't see that the face was just equivalent to a butte or mesa.",
        "\"Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\". Studying Venus is a worthy worth wild task despite the dangers that it involves. There are many positive things that may come out of exploring our dear neighbor Venus inlcluding how it might have once been just like Earth.\r\n\r\nVenus was once just like earth researchers have found many Earth like evidence to support this claim. Venus may have been fillwed with oceans once just like how we have them here. This planet may have had various form of life whether it be the tiniest things. Today there is still much evidence that can give off it has Earth type atmosphere. Such as the rocky sediments, the valleys, and the mountains. This way if we were to pursuit Venus we could cope with what we already know on about our planet Earth and how we have similar structures. It would be a worthy idea also because they have volcanoes and earthquakes some things we on earth have as well. We would be able to do this and discover if Venus was just like Earth.\r\n\r\nVenus can be a worthy pursuit because since it is not a far away planet we would be able to travel their with an advantage of it being close to Earth. Going to Venus would also be a the nearest option for a planetary visit as well. With not a single spacecraft touching Venus in 3 decades going back and replanning the visit to Venus would be a mega shock to others. Like as said in the paragraph Venus is around the same size and density of Earth so this would give our fellow space people a similarity of what Earth is like but in hotter and a bit more extreme troposphere.\r\n\r\nWith the improvement of technology we could have spacecrafts succefully land on Venus surface. Giving technology an area to expand as well this can also see what technology can do for us more in the future.",
        "On May 24, 2001, a NASA Viking 1 spacecraft had saw a landform on Mars that had happened to look like a human face. The spacecraft had taken pictures of this landform and show the world a few days later in order to attract people to Mars. Some people, like conspiracy theorists, say that it's evidence of alien life that NASA has hidden from the public, but if this had been something NASA was hiding, they wouldn't have show that photo at all to the public. Scientists and astronaunts have denied this by adding titles that suggest otherwise on there photos, showing the photo in the first place, and going back up to space to take more pictures.\r\n\r\nAccording to paragraphs 1 though 5, NASA had found a landforn that resembled a human face of an Egyptian Pharaoh located on a region called Cydonia. Mission control was surprised to see the face, but believed it was just another Martian mesa with unusual shadows, so they decided to reveal the pictures to the media, knowing there wasn't anything \"top secret\" or alien like about it. Then, according to paragraph 5, NASA had captioned the image, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,\" basically telling the public that it was just a quirky looking natural landform, not a big alien conspiracy theory. People defending the NASA budget even claimed they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars, basically meaning there wasn't life that they knew of.",
        "The Face is not a Alien made artifact because the scientist at NASA resherch and made diffrent trips to see the land formatin. The NASA camras did not make it easy to see if any thing was there. They went back 18 years later and took more pictures and found nothing that had to do with aliens makeing the landform.\r\n\r\nAt NASA the scientist it was a nother martin mesa because they are commen in that region of mars. They also said that the rock had no sign of alien life or ever haveing life. The large rock formation gave the shadow a alusion of the Face. When they went back in the summer of 1998 they took a picturre that proved that the large rock formation was just that.\r\n\r\nThe Face is not an alian made face because the scientist at NASA said the landform was giveing off a shadow alusion of a Face. There camras on the Viking 1 make it hard too tell if there was any thing there. They went back 18 years later an took more picture that were better because they had new tecnology.",
        "There are many conspiracies that the face was created by aliens but none of those conspiracies have evidence to back them up.From most information scientists have gathered they collected the information that it was just a natural landform. There is no evidential proof that aliens even exsist and many other things in space are created by natural landforms.When the web surfers surfed the web thet foiund the JPL image and it \"revealed that it ewas a natural lanform.There was no alien monument after all.\" There was also very similar rocks in the Amerucan West that formed naturally as well and that showed the the space rock can be formed the same way the other rocks were formed. As Garvin says in the article \"it reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" This means that this is not the only rock and there are other very similar one's that's why it is percieved to be a natural landform because if it was formed by aliens how did they do it very similar to the other's?\"If it looks like the other one's that it is easier to say that it is a natural landform.",
        "the usage of this new technology to read emotion has alot of potential for many things. It can read off your emotion even if your faking your smile, frown, etc. The use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable because it can benefit the students learning, it can make learning more enjoyable and can help the student with any conflict they are facing inside or outside of school.\r\n\r\nThis new usage of technology can be used to benefit many people. This new technology can benefit students by being able to know their emotional expression and how they feel that day this can lead to teachers helping cheer up the class if the majority are not doing the best. this could also detect the stress/worried emotion in a student letting a teacher now that they may be overworking their students. This is similar to how\r\n\r\nthey said \u00a8you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking on her face.\u00a8 if a teacher knew directly how stressed/worried you were they might slow down or postpone due dates for later dates.\r\n\r\nThis new technology can make the student into a new person and change their learning expierences. This new technology to read the emotional expressions of students can make a class enjoyable. For instance if you are not enjoying a class and or the class has always been boring or you know that you struggle in that subject this new technology can change that. This new technology can sense the emotions you feel class and inform the teacher on how you feel leading to the teacher making changes to the class or how he teaches. This was best explain when the article stated \u00a8A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, \u00a8Dr. Huang predicts. \u00a8Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\". this explains it all and how a teacher could use this to their advantage.\r\n\r\nThe usage of this new emotional expression reading technology could detect emotions that could cause dangerous things. for instance they can help a student who may be dealing with something outside or inside of the school.",
        "World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins in 1945. To help these countries recover their food supplies,animald and more,44 nations joined together and formed a UNRRA. The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The UNRRA hired \"Seagoing Cowboys\" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Like horses, young cows, and mules. So my friend and I signed up. We think you should sign up too.\r\n\r\nThe UNRRA was hiring \"Seagoing Cowboys\". This was a chance in a lifetime. It is good to join the UNRRA,because you help out people. It also helps you see new places you never been to. It helps you see new things. It a chance of a lifetime. You can buy things from every place you go too. You can tour around places. You can explore that new pace and you can also meet new people or friends. Maybe even if friends of your moved somwhere else you would probably go there country and see them.\r\n\r\nIt takes about two weeks to get from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern cost of the United States,and a month to get to China. Yes that might be awhile,but you can still do things on the boat. You also have to take care of the animals. You have to feed and watered two or three times a day. There is also a thing called night watchman.",
        "Things aren't always as they appear, just because it looks that way doesn't necessarily mean that it is that way. The formation on Mars does look like a face but it is just a land formation it's not like land formations are rare. Coincidences happen all the time, this is just one of those times. You can't judge something based on how it's looked, you have to really pay attention.\r\n\r\nFormations are a very common thing, both on Earth and on Mars. It is nothing strange, what is strange is that it looks like a head. But even at the picture was taken in 1976 with a much lower quality of camera so things wouldn't have looked as clear as a more modern camera, the other picture was taken in 2001, technology would have advanced and improved much in that time span as it was 25 years later. The quality would have improved so it would have been much easier to see and to know what it really was, it was just a coincidence and coincidences are just as common as land formations.\r\n\r\nCoincidences happen a lot, and this is just one of the instances that it happens. It may look like a face and something that was made but when you look at it again, with a different perspective you see what it really is. Like sometimes you will have food, like chips and it will look like a face or an object, but just because it looks like that doesn't mean that is that. Or sometime you will see something, but then have to look again to see if that's really what you saw, it's the same concept. Just because you see it doesn't mean it is that or that is even there.",
        "This face landform stucture found on Mars was not made by any living source. I belive nature took its course and it so happened to look like a face. Eyes, nose mouth it looks like a face no doubt about it, but it cannot be stuctured by living substances. Most scientists have been saying that this face was made by aliens, but I have to disagree. It just simply can not.\r\n\r\nI belive that the face on mars is just a natural landform because we do not even know if aliens exist in the first place. There is no prove that aliens exist so why are we jumping into the conclusion, assuming that aliens made this landform. Prove to me aliens exist then we can start thinking if they had anything to do with this. If not then I do not even think that aliens should be in this conversation. Also even If aliens made this landform that looks like a face, how can they make it like that. It is kind of a perfect face, and I belive that you need some technology to build a structure like that. I don't know how they could do all that by hand. Another topic about this landface I want to point out is the three photos. Have you not have noticed how the face changed every couple of years? Well I do. It makes me belive that nature has built that landface throughout the years withe the wind and rain and the planet shaking at times.",
        "I think driverless cars could be both a good and bad thing. A good thing would be that there wouldn't be alot of gas being used, and there wouldn't be a lot of cars. A bad thing, just like the article says, people would get bored not being able to drive. Another bad thing, is that the car is basically all computer, it could have a glitch or bug and someone could get hurt. Not all computers are good, some can malfuntion and not work right, leading to an injury.\r\n\r\nI agree with the article in paragraph 9, the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. I know not 100 percent of the time that's true,like when some people drive drunk or high, but most of the time it's safer with a human and not a computer. Humans are in control of where they go and what they do. Why let a computer do that for you?\r\n\r\nBy 2020, there will be alot more opinions about this whole driverless car thing. Right now I feel that the world is okay the way it is. I also see the good this in this car too. Less fuel being used, meaning more earth to enjoy. All the smoke from cars now is bad, in 2020 I hope there will be less smoke. Some people need to get out and see the world, and with this driverless car, people can travel anywhere they want and see what ever they want.",

If you got in one of these \"driverless cars\" you would be accountable for any damage done because you were supposed to be alert while riding in this driverless car.The development of driverless cars should cease because the car still needs human assistance,the car is not safe and the car weakens drivers alertness.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are not what they seem,false advertisement, you still have to drive them at some point. An article says that these cars are unable to direct through traffic or pull out of drive ways, the complicated things. If the car unables the driver to get out of doing the complicated work ,why have one ? The article also states the car is supposed to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Drivers do not need another human to take the wheel they can do it themselves, drivers need advanced technology to take the wheel , because all humans make mistakes, technology does not. Driverless cars are not good on highways because what if there is an accident on the highway and the driver is not alert, the car does not know how to detour its way around.Driverless cars are supposedly good on \"smarter roads\" , not every road is a smart road.

        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" sounds very interesting, but my arugement on this is article is against it because it sounds very unsafe. What if the driverless care malfunctions and you arent paying attention and get involved in the accident? Will the company of the car help you or give you another car or maybe even pay what is costed for the whole situation? Probably not. Its not worth making or even buying one of the driverless cars. Even a car itself malfunctions.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars can cost up to millions of dollars or even more. Driverless cars sound like you need to get one and leave the old one. The fact that the driverless car may be really expensive is ridiculess. Only famous people can afford it. Maybe other weathly people can. Not just anyone will be able to afford the car. Any person can afford a car at least that works even if it is an old car. Cars can cost lots of money when you can buy something else.\r\n\r\nMany, many people want this car because you dont have to drive but when there is an alert you have to drive. Also it requires a driver anyways. Many people want this car because you can just get one and it will drive by itself so that person can get one his or her phone while the car is in operation itself.

In the third paragraph it says \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.\" That statement proves that Venus is far too dangerous for human contact.\r\n\r\nIn spite the dangers of Venus, astronomers still discussing visits to this planet because they are fasinated by it because it may once have been the most \"Earth like\" planet in the solar system. As of right now there are no machines that could stand a chance on Venus because it is so dense. NASA is trying to work on different approaches to study Venus, in paragraph 6 is says \"peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of ligth cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of phtography and videogrphy ineffective.\" This statement proves that even when you are above Venus it is sill far too dangerous because of the dense atmosphere.",
        "Using this technology to read emotional expressions on students in a classrooom is not valuabe, because students and pretty much every human has a right to and does require their own personal space.\r\n\r\nPersonal space is something that might be broken by trying to aquire students feelings and emotions through a laptop. Hypothetically speaking , when your friend is upset you can see this emotion clear as day, and if you ask them what's wrong and you don't get a response, you may ask around to see if anyone knows, but hopefully you'd never try and put their face into a computer and try to read their emotions.\r\n\r\nAnother value to the everyday human that would be broken is privacy. The Mona Lisa might have been able to be read because it was a painting of what a young lady was feeling like eons ago, so it couldn't tell you if it wanted to be read or not, but a human being should have the right to express their emotions out loud or keep it to themselves, depending on how they feel about. Using a computer to tell their emotions just totally breaks all the rules to privacy, especially when it's being performed by a teacher or other students, which in hand would also waste time in the classroom.",

It be awesome to read somebody's emotions thorugh a machine. it would tell you alot about what a person is feeling and thats important to know. their are many excellent and well reasoned examples of why this technology is valuable.\r\n\r\nMy one reason i believe this is valuable technology is if somebody was feeling depressed and was not willing to open up to anybody that individual could do self harm to himself. If they know how that individual was feeling maybe they would have helped he/she. in the passage it says \" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused and bored\". Then Dr. Huang says\" then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This technology could become really usful for many different situations. Thats one of the reasons of why this makes this machine so valuable.\r\n\r\nThe creator of FACS[ [Facial Action Coding System] Dr. Paul Eckman has \"classified six basic emotions\". The machine can read happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. this type of technology can aid and solve world wide problem. For example what if an individual person or more were having issues with a certain subject at school but dont know how to ask for help. The Computer would make \" 3-D computer model of the face\" and they can anaylze what they might be feeling about the subject. then thats when the help comes.\r\n\r\nAnother example is reading different emotions is some how very important. It can be used against people who have commited crime.",
        "In the article \"Umasking the Face on Mars\", there are diffrent theories on what exactly they think this is. The logical answer is that the face is just a natural landfrom the article states not logical reasons and conspiracy theories not provided from NASA, they have done their research.\r\n\r\nDuring the article it provides pictures varying in dates from 1976, 1998 and 2001. Over these years it begins to form and show more. Its classified that it really is just a mesa. Different research and other many pieces of evidence back up this statement. It is just a natural landfrom.\r\n\r\nTwenty five years ago when the viking 1 was out it spotted the likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles end to end. They unveiled it as a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. Others refused to belive this and insisted that the NASA had to be covering up something, even though they provided all the research and more than needed.\r\n\r\nThe \"Face on Mars\" attracted films, books, magazines, radio talks. Some people still thought the face of it being something else was something they would rather hide than bring to the public eye. Even though they had all the facts and research to back up their theory of exactly what it was.",

        "About 25 years ago, NASA's Viking 1 and Viking 2 spotted what seeemed to be a giant face that resembled an Egypt Pharoah. Could this be an alien artifact? Haha,..nope just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nOnly a few scientist thought that the face was an artifact, but as soon as NASA heard this the made it a priority to go back and photograph Cydonia once again. Jim Garvin says \"We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" (Paragraph 6) This mean if it was an alien artifact NASA would have made money and benifited from finding this.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Michael Malin went back and photgraphed this again it revealed only a natural landform.(Paragraph 7) Later when others went back again to photograph it they were fortunet enough to get close enough to get a clear picture.",
        "In my english class, we are reading a book about outliers, and that is the first thing I think about when I think about driverless cars. Many people think that outliers in every situation is a good thing; not in this case. I do not believe that driverless cars is a good idea. I believe this because of false advertisement, reaction speed, and liability\r\n\r\nWhen I think of driverless cars, the first thing that I think of is that this vehicle will get me from point A to point B without me having to worry about anything. That is where the false advertisement comes in.\" In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driveless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but all are designed to notify the driver when the roads ahead need human skills\"\r\n\r\nIf I am purchasing this car, I wanna be with out a care in the world. I want to know that im gonna be able to get to where I need to be.\r\n\r\nI have had my license all of 3 months, and have experienced, getting cut off, rear ended, and much much more. These driverless cars will not react fast enough well to many decisions that a regualar person would still stuggle with. Imagine stopping at a red light; it turns green and you go. You look both ways while driving and see somebody run a red light who would of hit you if you werent more causious. \" The google car simply anoounces when the driver should be prepared to take over.\" No one would be able to react quick enough to these risk, which is why driverless cars is not a good idea.",
        "Exploration is key to a humans curiosity.Many people will indeed be anxious to explore something that is said to be impossible or dangerous because of curiosity.\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is a prime example. In this article the author states different reasons why it is worth stuying Venus depite the extreme dangers it brings.\r\n\r\nOne reason why the author of this article supports his ideas well is because he used statistics or in other words he used pathos.In paragraph five, he said\"...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\"He mentioned the idea of NASA creating a \"blimp-like\" vehicle to fly over the Venusian landscape.Then he went on and entered his counterclaim by saying\"...far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground condition...,\"therefore Venus would only be visible but not accesible and NASA would not be able to take samples of the planet.\r\n\r\nSecondly,he states some facts about Venus itself.He added that \"...Venus is the closests planet to Earth in terms of density and size.\"This is a good fact to add in to give the idea as to why NASA would choose to attempt studying Venus.Also he siad that\"...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.\"This gives the idea that the study of Venus has already been attempted before and has unfortunately failed every single time.\r\n\r\nLast but not least,in his conclusion he built a strong conclusion by mentionding in his opinion that\"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginataion and innovation.\" This can be used for both life and NASA continuing on trying and trying until they succesfully study Venus.",
        "A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to recognize emotions. As mentioned in the article, this technology can be useful in many formats; including psychology, art, and acting. Reading human emotions can be beneficial in some areas, but it is not valuable in the classroom setting because each student learns differently, computers should not be used as teachers, and the cost is not worth few benefits.\r\n\r\nIn the article, Dr. Huang predicts that with the new technology, the computer can recognize when a student is confused or bored and change the lesson to fix it. While this seems helpful, not every student learns the same way. A lesson that some students will understand, other students will be confused on. It would not be fair to the students who understand the lesson to make it easier because they might become bored, which the computer would then have to modify the lesson more to fix. The Facial Action Coding System is able to read human emotions, but it cannot satisfy the need of each individual student in a classroom. This technology also is not valuable to the classroom because a computer instructor is not valuable to the classroom in the first place. Computers should not be used as teachers because it can unemploy teachers, completely change the education system, and possibly bore students.",
        "The\r\n\r\nauthors claim on why we should keep on studying so we can land on venus has alot of great idea and points but i dissagree with him. I feel like we should not land on venus anytime soon because its way to risky and its not a habital place. Another reason why we should not\r\n\r\ngo on there is because its way too dangerous and not alot a people wouldwanna risk therre lives like that.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n\r\nthe article there is many reasons why they think we should try to land on venus even with ll the dangers. One reason is that they can make suits that will help the with the heat since its 170 degrees on that planet. Also they say that venus used to be\r\n\r\nan earth like planet where they think some type of people could of lived there. Lastly landing on venus could give us life changing information about or solar system and it can also give us a technology leap and we could start advancing in technolgy.\r\n\r\nIn conculsion there are many dangers to visting venus and NASA and other space companies are down to take that risk to see what is on that planet.",
        "The author didnt support this claim very well. The author talked alot about the dangers in Venus rather the good that comes from Venus. I say this because as I am reading I see how the author mentions many of times how Venus has extreme tempetures and how no one has went to Venus because of these extreme conditions.\r\n\r\nThe author says in paragraph 2 ,\"Numerous factors contribute to Venus\u0092s reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.\" Which gives the idea that it is a very dangerous place. You may begin to question \"Why would any one want to go to Venus\" or you may say to yourself \"This is not any where that i would want to go.\" The author also states in paragraph 3,\" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus\u0092s atmosphere.\" This is even more if a danger sign. No one would want to be anywhere where you could potentially suffocate. We also know from this paragraph that Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.",
        "Venus is the planet with the most similarities to our planet Earth. Venus is most definitely something worth exploring it is similar to our planet earth, it is dangerous, and it is just fascinating to explore different places.\r\n\r\nVenus is very much alike our planet earth Astronomers think that long ago Venus was covered in oceans and could have supported life. Venus also has many planet like structures for example valleys, mountains, craters, and much more. In pragraph 4 it says \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth today... The planet has a surface of rocky sedimemt and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" That shows how Earth and Venus are so much alike.\r\n\r\nEven though Venus is so much alike Earth it is way more dangerous. For example Venus temperature is way hotter than our temperature becaus it is closer to the sun and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to. I know that Planet Venus is a dangerous planet because in paragraph 3 it says \"A thick atmoshphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosohere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greaterthan what we experience on our own planet\" This proves that the conditions on Planet Venus is far to dangerous for us humans to be able to withstand.\r\n\r\nWith that being said Astronomers and scientists still believe it is worth exploring Venus because it is such a fasncinating planet.",
        "In the story the author presented both sides fairly. He stated the positives and negatives of driverless cars. I belive that driveless cars could soon be a common thing everybody uses.\r\n\r\nFirst thing that might be a big problem is that they use radars and those can cost two hundred million dollars, that right there is a down side. One of the positives of the car it can do is that BMW announced the \"Traffic Jam Assistant.\" The car can go as fast as 25 mph, but you have to keep you're hand's on the wheel. The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. It is all design to let the driver know the road ahead requires human skills, such as nabigating through work zones and around accidents. BMW's project manager driver said that it hopes to bring in-car entertainment and information systems. Some of the display can be turned off when the driver must take over. The in-car system is a great safety feature. One of the biggest down fall is the law. The law focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. They also said that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Because of this most states, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Some manufactures believe that even more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe. One of the biggest question is that if the technology fails and someone happens to be injured, who fault is it? Is it the driver or the manufacturer? I believe it would be the drivers fault because it was there fault they decide try to have a driveless car. This is one reason many people won't want to buy those type of cars. Even thought it has a big problem it can also be use for good things. Google cofounders said he can foresees they the cars will use half the fuel of today's taxi and is far more flecibiloty than a bus.",
        "Many people are thinking that the \"face\" on Mars is an actual face, or they say it was created by aliens. It was proven very well that it is not an actual face. One it is an rock, two the angle the camera was at cought the shadow of it so it seemed as if it was a face, and three the only reason it was told to be a face was for marketing.\r\n\r\nMy first reason was because it is a rock on mars. It states in paragraph three that it is a huge rock in formation of a human head. therefore that is one reason it is showing everyone that it is just a rock. The rock over the years has wathered down and it has more crevisises and it is losing the foerm of a face. If there was an actual face barryed under there it would never really lose its true form.\r\n\r\nMy second reason is that the angle of the camera was so that you can see the shadow and if they just wouldve gotten a better angle you woyld be able to see that there was nothing really there. If you were too also look at othere surroundings you would be able to see that there are many other masas on Mars. It also states that it may have been the pixles in the cameras. If we had the technology we have now when they first found it you would most likely have a better picture of it and be able to see what it actually looked like.\r\n\r\nMy final reason for it not being a face is that the only reason they continued on the theory of it being a face because they wanted good marketing.",
        "In this passage \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", the author made very detailed and valid points about the use of technology detecting what our expressions say about our moods, but, technology reading students facial expressions is over the top. I belive that this new technology would force students to always want to force a smile so that the computer doesn't fully recognize their real from their fake. In this essay I am going to tell you about my opinions on why I think that this new technology is bad for anyone to even have.\r\n\r\nFirst, I would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table, but who would want to feel like their being watched? \"For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" This information is truly invalid. Smiling at an ad does not make it appear the next time you get on a different website, and frowning at an ad doesn't change it either. It's the way the ads are set up that it makes them leave or come back. Student's shouldn't have to feel like they have to fake their emotions just so that the computer doesn't recognize how they feel in reality.",
        "In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author is stating that he thinks people should study Venus. The author stated many reasons on why he thought they should study Venus no matter what the dangers or conditons are on the planet. I think it would be good to explore and study Venus because it was stated to be very similar to how Earth is now.\r\n\r\nThe author stated Venus is offten referred to as Earth's \"twin\", and that it is sometimes one of the closest planets to Earth besides Mars. Venus is also called the \"Evening Star\", because sometime you can see it from Earth. The tempatures on Earth and Venus are very differant, although the author thinks that at one point, Venus could of had living people, oceans, and could of been very close to how Earth is now. Venus still has features that make it similar to Earth.\r\n\r\nVenus now has a differant atmosphere. The atsmosphere is thicker and 97 percent carbon dioxide. NASA has tried to study Venus in the past, but no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA has not tried to take any kind of space craft to Venus for more than 3 decades. On Venus, the surface averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The conditions are for more extreme. Venus has the hottest suface temperature of any other planet.",
        "Have you ever wanted to spend more time with your family? Well you may have that opportunity sometime in the future. Even as we go about our daily lives people somewhere are working to make that happen. With driverless cars we can spend more time with our family. The driverless car will no doubt help lessen the accidents caused by cars, it will also allow you to do something more important than driving on your way to and from work, and it will help keep your children under control because of you being able to talk to them about their actions in the backseat of your car.\r\n\r\nAutomated driving will help stop accidents from happening. Driverless cars are safer because they use sensors rather than the human attention span. Also driverless cars have an automatic brake system in a child or car got in front of the car at any time the car would be able to stop before collision. The cars will also allow everything to be more electronically inclined. If we get automated cars it will change how we live and our productivity.\r\n\r\nWhile driving a car you have to pay a lot of attention to any hazards that may come along, and you don't have any time to work on the project for your workplace. While you are driving you could have been working on said project, but you couldn't due to the fact that you had to pay attention to the road. If we develope automated cars it will help bring work productivity up and sales along with it. The economy could really get a boost from them. Which would help people get jobs and more people would come out of poverty. Which could help us pay more attention to the future generation.",
        "Driverless cars have seem to have made a name for themselves throughout history. Not only have you seen some driverless cars on movies, they are actually being tested for human use! Even though it seemed to be some kind of fantasy, it is coming, and coming fast. Driverless cars should be created for humans to not only avoid accidents but for other uses.\r\n\r\nThe most common use for a driverless car is safety. Humans are fond of making mistakes, its nature. Sooner or later, driverless cars will take care of accidents for you. Some are being tested by Google, BMW, and GM. Though, none have been released for public use, many have been able to test with some driverless cars.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of driverless cars can be a full list. People who have jobs one day will run late. If so, that one day can be taken care of by a driverless cars, not only getting ready in your car is a convenience but a blessing. It could and might just save you your job! Many laws are enlightened to keep both your hands on the wheel, but with driverless cars you don't need any. Just think of the things you could do in a car driven by a computer.\r\n\r\nSafety has seemed to be a problem with the cars being built lately. Some driverless cars have had malfunctions here and there. Cameras have been installed inside and outside of cars to see where many occur. The side of the car is the most dangerous to get hit by. Creators of these cars have made the car resond to computer-based brakes.",
        "I believe that we should not use driverless cars, in my opinion they are an accident wating to happen. The arguments saying we should switch to driverless cars sound far fecthed. The text uses statements such as, \"the cars would use half the fuel of todays cars\", \"they offer more flexibility\", and that \"they are much safer\". These arguments are invalid in many ways that I will explain.\r\n\r\nThey text says that driverless cars would be cheaper than cars that require a human to handle them, but they are not. Driverless cars aren't even driverless, they still require a human skill to take over when the car cannot comprehend what to do next. Driverless cars would be much more expensive to obtain and operate than a normal car. Driverless cars have many different extremely expensive gadgets needed to even make it semi-automatic, they require position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor. A normal human operated vehicle does not require any of those things, so if a person did wish to get a driverless car, they would be paying a substantial amount of money and even more for fuel, to keep up with the parts and technology, and for gas. With a manual car all you have to do is purchase it (for a much smaller amount) and pay gas money and body shop bills should they arise, but still yet, it would be a lot less than the driverless car.\r\n\r\nThe text also states the driverless cars offer more flexibility than a manual car, this is untrue, they actually offer less. With a manual car, you are the driver and you choose where to go and what to do, with the driverless car you are supposed to tell your GPS where to take you and that's all the input you have.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System is a great achivement in science and technology, but should it be used in your computer at school? There are many reasons why using this coding systam could be a great thing in the class room, or a disaster. As stated in the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, if we could put this in our everyday school computers, it could calculate whether or not a student is having trouble with a lesson and change it for them to help them. What are the pros? What are the cons?\r\n\r\nSome of the pros to using this coding system in students computers is as stated in the article, it could read the studens facial expresssions and determan if he or she is confused or having trouble understanding the lesson. If it could do this it could change the way the lesson it tought better helping the student understand.\r\n\r\nBut what if schools dont teach lessons online. For example, my school does not teach lessons online. Our teachers might give us website addresses to look up and use for studying, depending on the teacher. Unlike other schools around me that do E-learning. They either stay at home, or go to school and do a whole days work off of their school issued computers. This Facial Action Coding System would work greatly for those students that do E-Learning, but not so much for the ones that don't.\r\n\r\nSecondly, does this system cost anything?",

When explaining the type of features Venus has, the author mentions that it has signs of physical features that Earth has right now. The author states that some of the familiar features are valleys, moutains, and craters and probably convered in oceans. A lot like Earth. By addressing the fact that Venus has signs of similar physcial features as Earth, the author makes the point that if we continue to study Venus we can learn more about Earth and what could possibly happen to Earth.

For example in paragraph two they say the car cannot operate or minuver through traffic , road blocks, accidents etc.\r\n\r\nSo what if there's a storm, or a tornado, or earth quake or something? Will the car know what to do then? If you're going to have to take over you might as well drive it yourself anyway. What could you possibly do for those short moments of time anyway? A driver is always supposed to stay alert and focussed no matter what. Whether you are driving or not because you never know what could happen. Safety first! I dont think a computer is accuipt enough or qualified to think , act, or make decisions a human is supposed to make.\r\n\r\nThen what happens if you do decide to let the car do what it is programed for and ypou do get in accident or get hurt? Then what like they said in paragraphs 9 & 7, the big argument will be who,s fault is it, the driver or manufacturer?",

More importantly scientist cannot take sample rock from other world to do research.\r\n\r\nSecondly if Scientit don't study about the planet of Venus we will not know nothing about the planet itself. If they don't study about Venus we will not know what happen in the begining on Venus. We will also not know if life exist on Venus. We will also not know is Venus a planets or a star and what is the closest planet to Venus.",
        "\"Hmmmm, i think it would be great to have others in the Seagoing Cowboys program.\" Luke Bomberger is apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program and thinks it would be great if new faces would join the program as well. So Luke is thinking about how he'd get the message out to people so they could probably be in the program. ''I should talk to the others and see what they think.\" Luke said, so he spreads the word to the other guys and they all think it's a great idea. Luke was amazed everyone was wanting others to join the program also. All of a sudden luke thought to himself ''We'll be getting back on board in three more days. So he told the guys that they need to get the word out to as many people as they could instantainiously. So they thought of a plan then one of the guys blurted out and said, 'since were on land right now we could probably find a radio station around here.\" So the other guys gave him a high five and telling him that's an brilliant idea. So the guys took a map and started roaming around seeing if they could find a radio station. And about two hours later of searching they finally found a little radio station in the middle of no where.",
        "The Face of Mars was a historic discovery, and not because it was a new kind of land form. When the photo was first released, many thought it was an alien structure and that it proved there once was life on Mars. NASA then worked harder to understand the strange picture and to change the opinion of skeptics who tried to make it an ancient temple.\r\n\r\nThe first photo that was released was a low quality picture and the strange shadows gave it the look of a face. NASA began to obsess about the face and they began to get better and better resolution photos. It became more apparent that the face was just a mesa, which were common in the area. Skeptics insisted that NASA proves that is just a hill and NASA continued finding out more about the mesa. as the resolution improved, nearly all second-guessers were silenced. This happened because scientists were convinced that this landform was much like the Middle Butte in Idaho, which was most definately not made by aliens.",

And he has many reasons for thinking and suggesting it and here the way that he says that it would be worthy of pursuit is by putting facts that would be helpful in the article.\r\n\r\nSome of the advantages that the article would have is that it is very well informed and it have a lot of evidence that we could use to say that it is a study that is worthy of pursuit. In the articleit says\u00b4Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and occasionaly the closest in distance to\u00b4.This is saying that venus is closer to us and we have more adantage of knowing more about it because more people can go on it since it is closer.

        "Was there another Earth like the one you are living on right now? I and all the NASA researchers ask you this question in a sense that you will understand. Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago Venus was probaly covered with oceans and life forms. We know this because Venus has surface features that look like Earth's. Through the use of technology, researchers found valleys, mountains, and craters on Venus, leading us to think that it is extremly similar to Earth.\r\n\r\nVenus is the second clost planet to the sun and regulates a 800 degree temperature on it's surface. The atmosphere is also covered in thick sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide clouds (author 3). These vile conditions make it impossible for technology to touch the surface. You may ask if it's impossible why are we still trying. The answer is that Venus is extremly similar to Earth and could possibly reveal secrets of the universe.\r\n\r\nThrough technology researchers have found reminents of valleys, mountains, craters, and oceans. Making it possible that a form of life was once there. Was there life? What happened to the planet?",
        "The new technology is very helpful showing about whats more to a picture or a frame. Why is this important well beacuse people want to know about more about the picture or of what the picture is showing for example, Mona Lisa smile to not be so serious in the picture imagine having a cute picture but your so serious. You can change that with new tecnology. Comperters are very helpful theses days in many ways. For example it can be useful for making payments , searching up information you need , paperwork, photoshop, diffrent apps that are useful on making your life better. Its a better sorce of seaching stuff up learning more about the world and the physics. Theres more to this i mostly use it for searching up information about the topic i want to learn about. Its easier for me beacuse i dont like rreading alot and i can just look up videos instead of having to sit there for an hour looking up information or reading it beacuse reading makes me sleepy. Thats why i think the web is an awsome resorse for people that need to be informed and thought many diffrent things.\r\n\r\nMany people use this method by making there photogrophy work look better than it is. Its a very good sorce for people that have the job as a photographer beacuse they will make everything work in many ways. For example if something in the picture gets in the way the computer will show u how to get rid or it instead of doing all the extra stuff on taking a whole lot of pictures that look the same or worst. Why waist your time on doing that instead get the app or the program and get to steping its way better and easier to get pictures that are perfect.",

This is saying that the natural landform is formed by shadows.\r\n\r\nAnd another thing is that they went again to see if they could take a picutre again of the natural landform but, they had a better camera they would allow them to see better if it was true that the natural landform was true. \" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 metters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.\".

        "Ever have a happy feeling where you can't stop smiling or felt that dearth of happiness to where you may possibly cry? Those are part of your emotions, something every human being has. Dr. Paul Eckman has created valuable technology to help show a persons emotions. Dr. Huang helps us reveal much of the sciene of emotions.\r\n\r\nYour face is fraught with 44 different major muscles. These muscles move around in various ways to show emotion as well as other activities used by you face. These muscles have been programed into a 3-D computer based program also known as FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to help scientist show someone's different emotions. Dr. Paul Echman, the creator of FACS, has classified the six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with charecteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, when you raise your eyebrows, you use the frontalis pars lateralis muscle showing that you're surprised. You use your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) to tighten your lips to show anger.\r\n\r\n\"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\" observes Dr. Huang,\"even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.\" One example of this is not smiling as broadly. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks facial moventens. How can this be benifital to teacher and in everyday classroom studies? Teachers can use this to tell how a student my feel emotionally.",
        "The author claims that exploring Venus despite the dangers is a worthy pursuit. Which it may or may not be. They tell us about the dangers in pressure and heat on the surface of Venus and how it may stop us from getting to there physically. The author also explains how we could explore our sister-planet, Venus in a couple ways and tries to put it into perspective for us.\r\n\r\nThe author starts with talking about previous missions to reach Venus that ended unsuccessful due to Its harsh surface and atmosphere. The atmosphere of Venus is almost 97% carbon dioxide and to add onto that the clouds carry highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Making it difficult already to get a human or anything really through just the atmosphere living. The surface of Venus can average over 800 degrees farenheit along with the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than our own. These conditions are far too much for a human to make it to the surface of Venus which can set back this exploration of Venus.\r\n\r\nMoving on further the author states \"If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?\" He/She answers this question with the thought that long ago Venus may have been just like the earth we live on now. Covered in stable land and oceans, supporting many lifeforms, and maybe vegetation. Reason for thinking this is even today Venus has some features that are similiar to Earth. The rocky sediment surface, valleys, mountains, craters all show similiarity between Venus and earth. The author seems to want a return to Venus because we may be able to find more clues for this thought.\r\n\r\nThe author sees a return to Venus as indisputable, but questions, \"What are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive.\" They answer this question by proposing an idea by NASA to send humans to Venus. This idea would be a possible solution to avoid the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus. A blimp-like vehicle that hovers over the surface of Venus keeping them from the harsh conditions.",
        "Well, first of all I agree with the new technology called the Facial Action Coding Systyem that enables computers to identify human emotions and I think the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because some students might be having some troubles fixing their emotions, and i'm not sure if the essay is to write about the teachers using it to read the students emotions or it is the students theirselves that are using it to read their own expressions, eitherway i'm going to write about the two topics. About what I said about the students fixing their emotions is that some of the students might be so emotional that any little thing like when someone curses them they start crying, they might want to use this technology to see how their emotions are high or low, so they keep track of it and reduce the emotions till their brave enough to face anyone without having a lot of fear in them. And some of the students might have too much anger and they want to reduce it before it cause trouble for them and they might try it(Facial Action Coding System.)",
        "In the year of 1976, an object was discovered that looked like a human face on the planet Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars and taking pictures of possible places for Viking 2 to land. This 'human head' as they call it stretched two miles from each end of Mars. The passage states, \"It seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.\" NASA believed that there must have been a degree suprise among the mission controlers at the Jet Propulsion Lab when this 'Face' appeared on their monitor screens.\r\n\r\nDays after this what seemed to be 'human face' was released for all to see. The authors say, \"It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" It did! NASA decided to call it \"Face on Mars.\" This 'Face' became a popular icon throughout the world. The text states, \"It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" This object on Mars lead people to think that maybe there really was life on Mars.\r\n\r\nWhen the MGS arrived at the Red Planet in September of 1997, 18 years after the Viking missions ended photogrpahing, Cydonia was still a big priority for NASA. Chief scientist, Jim Garvin says, \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" Jim believed it was important to taxpayers. One year later on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time takig a picture that was ten times sharper and more clear than the photos taken by Viking. Thousands of people were waiting for the picture of the Face to appear on their monitor screens any minute.\r\n\r\nNot everyone was satisfied with the picture of the Face that was taken that day. The author states, \"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.\"",

Even though it will be a struggle to study Venus it would be worth it beacuse it could be a second earth. It would be hard to get on the surface of Venus the average temperature is over 800 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe study of Venus would be hard but NASA has one compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. They would have to hover/float above the fray at about 30 or more miles above the landscape and the air pressure would be close to Earth sea levels it wont be an easy conditons for humans but surviable. However they would have to get close to Venus surface so that they could get rock samples. That's why the author says they would need to make a machine to last a long enough time to cotribute meaningfully on Venus.

In many aspects, not to mention. Landforms, shadows, and shading galore. In pictures, the face seems to contain basic details to give t the \"person\" type of vibe off. However, there is just one problem.\r\n\r\nWith the face being known as looking human, there are details still missing. Such as, the rest of the body.

        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author argues the point that exploring Venus is worth the effort and risks exhibited. The author claims that, despite the harsh conditions and deadly atmosphere, this planet is worth travelling to and observing, due to its being the \"nearest option for a planetary visit\". While the author does list a few good reasons for Venus exploration, it is my belief that they also include many reasons not to explore this dangerous planet. This inclusion of the \"cons\" of exploration hurts the thesis more than it helps it, and damages the authors argument.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of their argument, the author states that \"no spacecraft survived the landing [on Venus] for more than a few hours\" and that \"not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades\". The usage of these statements creates a negative image, which can lead readers to believe that the exploration of Venus is too dangerous to enagage in. Furthermore, the author uses facts intended to continue to convince readers that Venus is dangerous, when this is exactly the opposite of what the author is arguing for. Making statements which invoke fear or apprehension only pushes the reader away from the topic, instead of influencing him or her to gain interest in it. For instance, when the author uses phrases with negative connotations, such as \"thick atmosphere\", \"corosive sulfuric acid\", \"800 degrees Fahrenheit\", and \"extreme\", they influence readers negatively as well.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the author provides little reasoning behind the belief that humanity should explore the planet Venus.",

        "My personal position on this matter is against cars driving themselves. Because with this new techology a person must still have to drive but only in some sitations, if the car drives itself for most the time then when a person is crossing the road the car will do one of two things. If the car sees the person and does not know what to do it will signal the driver, but if the driver is not prepared or not watching the road the driver cannot respond in time to save that persons life. Another outcome can be if the radar is not facing the person the car will not \"see\" the human crossing and when the hits the person who is the murderer? Is it the car or the driver.\r\n\r\nAs shown at the end of paragraph 9, when there is a fight in court about an accident who is liable?

That person could go to jail for not watching the road, when all that driver did was trust the car. I have read the article and never did say anything about a override from the driver. Which means if the driver did see the person crossing the road and he/she wanted to stop they couldn't and then when the person is hit and killed are they now responsable for this crime.\r\n\r\nMost of auto-cars alert the driver to take control if there is roadwork ahead. As shown on paragraph 2, but can the driver be alerted in time to stop a crash? Which causes even more possible problems, as explained in paragraph 7, none of the cars are driverless and there are a few ways been made to alert the driver like vibrating seats and flashing lights.",
        "In World War 2, I was asked if I wanted to join thew UNRRA to become a seagoing cowboy. I believe that you and others should join because you maybe be helping your country and other countries.

I really think you should join because it is a really fun experince.\r\n\r\nI have multiple reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys of the UNRRA. One reason you should join is that you could sightseeing while you are picking up the animals from the country ar in or on the way to other countries. Another reason you should join this program is when you turn 18 you could join other military services and other projects like this one. The thrid reason is the you get work with animals such as young cows, mules ,and horses. Final reason is that when you ngo from country to counrty you will go relaxz and have fun with your mates and you could final read that book you been wanting to read. Those are my reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.\r\n\r\nAfter all of these reasons would you want join the program.",

It is proved that Venus is a challenging place to examine closely because it has a lot of stuff that humans can not experience. Venus is a challenging planet for human to study closely because there are stuff that are extremely dangerous for humans and that humans can not do such as: Venus is not always close to Earth, the temperature and atmosphere is greater than what we experienced in Earth and it's danger to get to Venus.\r\n\r\nVenus moves a lot from us or we move a lot from venus. There are differences from Venus and us what I mean with that is that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. In paragraph 2, the authors said humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and that there is not a single spaceship that has survived the landing for more than a few hours and has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.\r\n\r\nThe temperature and atmosphere in Venus is greater than in Earth.

It could also help a teacher find out how to teach a specific subject the way thsts most beneficial to students. The computer reading emotions could help with that by letting the teacher know a kid is confused about something.

        "In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worth-while task. Although Venus poses many risks to humans and technology, the information and resources that can be taken from Venus are overwhelming.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the article, the author explains the many complications that come along with trying to study Venus. Previously, more than three decades ago, there were numerous attempts to study Venus, but shorty after landing spacecrafts, they were destroyed due to the conditions. This is because of the daunting environment Venus possesses, the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, temperatures can acceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure on Earth. Although these environmental factors seem to be disasterous for almost anything that would dare set foot on the planet, the author decribes two possible ways to get around this delima. First the author describes an idea posed by NASA. NASA says that sending people to Venus is possible, as long as they're above the intense conditions of the planet. They say that hovering at around the height airplains fly in hot airbaloons, humans could uncomfortably survive. Second, simple systems that use mechanical parts, have been proven to last up to three weeks in a simulated recreation of Venus. Theses \"rovers\" could prove useful for grathering test samples that the balloons above the atmosphere would not be able to, also they would be able to take greater quality pictures and study the land more effectively.",
        "The author supports the suggestion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by providing benifits and solutions to exploring Mars.\r\n\r\nIn the text it states 'Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like plantet in our solar system'. This shows that by studying Venus we may learn that Venus was once like Earth.\r\n\r\nIn the text it also states 'recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit'. This shows that Venus is the easiest to get to in terms of speed/time.\r\n\r\nFinally they provide ways that space agencies are working on solutions to exploring Mars. For this, the text states 'NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray'.\r\n\r\nThese support the authors' suggestion by showing reasons as to why we should study Venus and the fact that agencies already are researching solutions to exploring Venus.",

In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author's idea is that \"Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.\" How good is he at explaining it? In his article, the author doesn't do well in supporting his idea.\r\n\r\nTo start, the author mostly provides evidence for the counter agrument. The author states, \"it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.\"\r\n\r\nHe also states, \"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\" The entire third paragraph also talks about the disadvantages of pursuiting Venus. In that paragrph he states, \"These conditions are far more extreme than aything humans encounter on Earth.\" This shows that the author doesn't support his idea well because his evidence supports the counter argument.\r\n\r\nThe author's claim is that it is worthy pursuiting Venus, but they can't take further samples because of the risks. The author states, \"More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\" NASA had an idea for sending humans to study Venus, on a blimp-like vehicle. But the conditions aren't easy. According to the article, \"temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.\"",

        "I support the developement of driverless/autonomous cars. Cars have been driven by human drivers so far and accidents are frequent and often violent. If we had autonomous cars, we could almost completely eliminate human error altogether. Autonomous cars would also be more efficient.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars would replace they human driver, who can be sometimes angered by other drivers, distracted by passengers, or get easily lost in new places, with a more logic minded computer. An autonomous car would be safer than a human driven car because a computer program cannot be distracted by its passengers or get angry at someone's poor driving because a computer doesn't think emotionally, but rather logically, making the computer driver safer. Google has been test driving partial-autonomous cars in certain conditions for 7 years and has so far had no crashes.\r\n\r\nAutonomous cars would not only be a safer alternative to human driving, but a more fuel eficient, and therefore, greener alternative. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, autonomous cars would be twice as fuel efficient as today's taxis and buses. With more fuel efficient cars, pollution due to carbon dioxide emmisions will drastically decrease. Fuel efficient cars also help the American economy because if cars are using half as much gasoline, then we only have to import half as much oil, which will save us money as a country.",

They even mentioned in the artilce how the cameras on board of MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face clearly but skeptics a different thing. That pobably aliens makings were being hidden by the haze. Which were not likely it could of been the air,because the human like face was located in the north martian latitude where it was already winter. It could of been the breeze from the snow.\r\n\r\nWho would think that aliens would do that if they knew we were going to spot it evenutly. The picture that was taken in 2001 was more bigger and more proseize on what we would of been looking at then it was in 1976. The picture that was taken in 2001 made people see that there was nothing to worry about and that it was just a rock looking like a face.",

Here are some reasons why.\r\n\r\nThey thought it would be a good way to engage the public by giving the liiusion of eyes,nose,and mouth. They wanted people to be interested and it worked. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and realized it was no alien monument after all. The picture was ten times clearier than the other ones. Skeptics assumed alien markings were hidden by haze. But that's not true. Just like any other landforms it would be hard to see. It's hard work to target cydonia. Whenever they get a chance tot they try to capture it. In 2001 they captured a even better picture. It was like Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shack. But it was really a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. It looks like the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Most peopel didn't believe or want to beieve it. They thought the aliens created it because you could not really see the face. The 1.56 meters,compared to 43 meters per pixel is the best 1976 Viking photo. So whatever they were seeing was an illusion. There's no alien monument on the face so it has to be a landform.",
        "In the article, \"Driving Cars Are Coming\", there should not be a development of driverless cars. Driverless cars can cause so much stress safety wise and court wise. There should not be driverless cars.\r\n\r\nFirst, Driverless cars can cause alot of stress on people and there safety. There is no proof that these cars can handle the main streets and highways, the author explained that these cars have only been tested on tracks that were specially made for these cars when he said,\"General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track.\" Also the people oppurating these cars may get lazy while the car is in motion from just sitting there and might ending up falling asleep, the author described the fact that these cars only alert you when human assistance is needed but what if the driver falls asleep? The author says, \"This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" That is why the cars are not up to standards for safety.\r\n\r\nSecond, Driverless cars can also become a great dibate in the court house. Everyone has different views on who to blame if the car was to get into an accident and the driver or passengers were to be injured.The author says,\"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" Also new laws would have to be made if these cars were to be made and out on the market, because of liability issues.",
        "Do you remember the first day you got your license? I know I do, and now with all the technology they're trying to make cars that drive themselves. Drivless cars would be fun and all, but how are they going to help us? How are they going to hurt us?\r\n\r\nGetting my licese was the best day of my life. I finally knew that I had freedom to go out and drive and have control of what I wanted to do. They're trying to manufacture driveless cars, and I don't see it doing anything but causing problems. There is a lot of responsibility with driving and if this \"Driveless Car\" crashes, who's fault is it? It shouldn't be the drivers fault, and I don't think manufacturerers are going to take the blame for a malfuncton in the car either.\r\n\r\nDriving has never been a real problem in the past for anyone. Yeah there is an occasional wreck or a tragedy, but the only real problem that driving has had is people driving under the influence. If these driveless cars do become a thing, I can see way more people driving under the influence because they don't have to have complete control of the car, then who is responsible for the wreck? The car that is supposed to drive itself, or the impaired driver?\r\n\r\nCar prices have gone up over the last few years, and not just in a slight change. Cars used to be reasonably cheap and now with all the technology the companies are putting in the cars the prices have sky-rocketed. The only thing that this driveless car is going to do is push the prices of vehicles up even more, and some people as it is already can't afford cars.",
        "Some people believe that The Face on Mars was created by aliens. It's good to use your imaginations, but sadly, that wouldn't be the case. Most to even all evidence proves that The Face is simply a natural landform on Mars, similar to natural landforms on Earth. It's a common happening, and the most logical answer.\r\n\r\nUs scientists at NASA have been researching The Face for years. Sure, the first picture of The Face did resemble that of a human face, or an Egyptian Pharaoh as it says in paragraph 2 of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", but since then we've been able to get better, higher-quality pictures that show that what made The Face look like a face was simply shadows. The Face is a landform on Mars, and that's simply it. It's similar to \"landforms common around the American West\", as it states in paragraph twelve, it's the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" here on Earth.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't convince you that it's not aliens that created The Face, hopefully this will. In paragraph 5 of the article on The Face, it states \"Some people think the Face is 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This isn't true. If NASA were to find life on Mars, it would benefit us. We wouldn't have a reason to hide it. As proof, that's also stated in paragraph 5, \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" Now, if defenders of our budget wish that there were ancient civilizations on Mars, don't you think we wouldn't hide it? This shows that it would benefit us if it were that, proving further that aliens aren't the creators of The Face.",

For example, if the teacher says that the students must choose a story to read, but it had to be online, the computer would be able to give a list of suggested stories, and, based on the students facial expression while reading each title, it could give the article that would be the best for that student. If students are interested in a topic, they are most likely to read more and more about it, thus improving their lexile level and reading comprehension.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it could also distract students from their school work. When the students have free time, they will play games, watch videos, etc., while the computer reads the students face while they are doing so.

This shows how Venus is way more extreme and humans wouldn't handle it. NASA have worked on solutions to makimg a mission safe and scientifically productive. Floating above the fray would allow scientist to study Venus the author used an example of a blimp-like vehicle.",
        "Driverless car`s In my opinion are a pretty smart idea for the people who lke to be on there phone while driving and risk theres and others life . Or a person who drinking and can get home safely cause he dont have to drive because the smart car will drive for him to get home. The smart car`s can lower the rate of deaths because of drunk drivers and people who text and drive . The smart car can also help with drives who slowly fall asleep at the wheel so they can take it easy but not fall asleep while driving because if the smart car is driving, but the human driver still has to be alert at all times because they may come across a road that takes human skill driving to go through like work site`s, accident`s,etc . In a negative way they can be a bad idea because what if there is a mechanical malfunction with the car itself like a problem that the owner of the car couldnt fix by hand because it had to be done by machines or experts then you wouldnt have a car for the time being .",

        "There is diffren't arguments about the Face spotted on Mars. Some believe it is an alien artifact, and some believe it is just rocks. I'm here to tell you it it just rocks. So, there is nothing to worry about. If you don't believe me, just keep reading... and you will soon learn it is just your imagination. But some people probably never will learn. Till then, just read this... Maybe I will change your mind if you really believe it is a face. Or maybe I won't. Let's see what you choose.\r\n\r\nFirst, it just your eyes messing with you! Your eyes can play tricks on you and make you see things that are not really there. This is just rocks oddly placed and the rocks have shadows. That it all your seeing. If it were really a so called \"face\" on Mars, that would mean there would have to be life on Mars before. Have they proven life on Mars? They only found traces of water in the past. So, there could have been life on mars, but we haven't found anything besides this Face. Yes, if we found more ''faces'' we could consider it. But, we haven't, and there isnt enough evidence to support it.\r\n\r\nAlso, over the past 25 years... we've seen the Face everywhere in papers.\r\n\r\nThis could all be a scam, people are just trying to get people intrested in Mars more. There is always false advertisment in commercials, news articles, ect. This is just another one of those! We would have found something out in 25 years. And what do you know? Nothing. All there is, is a picture. They even took a picture a second time and still found nothing,said it was just a natural landform.",
        "Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotion would be great for students in a classroom. I am going to give the most outstanding reasons and examples on why this would be excellent for students. Once, I am done you will be able to fully understand my point of view and how it would be great for students in a classroom. Also, be sure to notice the way I verifiy my answer for you to draw the same conclusion as I do. This technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be great. Well because it'll inform teachers on how a student feel about the work, notify if the students have things going own in personally life, and it would decrease the rate of students dropping out of school.\r\n\r\nFirst, it'll inform teachers on how the student feel about the work. For example, \"if you were to give the student work that they don't understand but wouldn't tell you\". Due to the fact of having the computer reading the student expression you will be able to know and find out what is really going on with the student on the subject they are stuck on. Once, you notice that you will be able to help the student out on the things that they are stuck on. Then, the fact of you knowing things about the student revolve around the computer providing information.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it would notify if the student is going through anything in their personal life because of the facial expressions that is being read. For example, \"a student is getting beat at home very badly but choose not to let anyone know\". Then there is the computer that will tell the teacher what is going on and why they are acting the way they do. The Facial Action Coding System will report that the students is holding something in and is showing fake emotions on how they are really feeling. In a way, this would means this type of technology would become literally a life saver. Well because something bad at home can really come to the light and better the student from the things they are going through.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would decrease the rate of student dropping out of school. For example,\"students that are likely to drop out are the ones who keep quiet about them not understanding something\".",
        "In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile' the author is telling us about the FACS\r\n\r\nwhich stands for facial action coding system that can identify human emotions. This technology will be valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. Teachers and students would be able to use this amazing technology in which ever way needed.\r\n\r\nThe FACS technology is an amazing way to determine the emotions of people by reading their muscles of the face or the way ones mouth is moved. In paragraph 6 the author tells us if the student becomes confused about a lesson on the computer, then the computer could read facial expressions then later on modify the lesson so that it becomes more interesting to the student or whoever maybe working on the assignment. This piece of technology would be helpful in my school or in any school because if the students are working on a assignment or test and they get confused maybe the computer could help the students out. In other words, give the students a hint or re word the problem they were struggling on. This system of technology is beyond amazing\r\n\r\nThe FACS system is an effective and amazing piece of technology. The author lists so many ways it can read your facial expressions it is beyond amazing. The system can be helpful in a classroom especially in circumstances where students need extra help or are behind, ths piece of technology would be beyond useful.",

Also, on April 5, 1998, thousands of web users were anxiously waiting for the very first image on a JPL web site, which seemed to reveal that it was actually a natural landform.\r\n\r\nNext, not everyone was happy with the results of it being a natural landform and not created by a alien.

        "Do you think driverless cars are a good idea? Yes or No? Driverless cars can have positive effects and negative effects. The cars could change the world or they could not end well.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are not a good idea at all.\r\n\r\nThe reason is, because the cars really are not fully driverless. if you are in a constrution zone or near an accident the car has you take over. The car isn't full capable of handling driving in a situation like that. The car lets the driver know when they should take over. So the question is \" If the car is driverless how come you have to take over in certain situations\"? Why can't the car handle it all on its own since the car is smart? For the driverless cars to be very smart they need a bunch of sensors.\r\n\r\nMy postion on driverless cars is I think they are a bad idea. They can't fully handle all situations. Also if the person behind the wheel is drunk or worse and they come upon a bad accident \" What will they do\"? \" How will they act\"? Since the car can't handle itself and the driver is incoherent I dont think the ending result will be very good at all.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the driver of the car must stay alert at all times and be ready to take over if needed. If there is an accident or the wiring or technology fails in the car.\r\n\r\n\"",
        "Having a computer that can tell what you are feeling can and can't be a good thing. Like you could be sad or depressed and not want anyone to know but they computer does. It can send information to people and you didn't want those people knowing how you are feeling. This can cause problems in a family because it may tell them something they didn't want to know.\r\n\r\nFirst off some people would rather keep to themselves because sometimes showing their real self can hurt others. You can always fake being happy or fake being interested in something that you aren't, but the computer can figure out how you are really feeling and let people know that you aren't interested in the thing they are talking about or happy that someone is talking to you. It can ruin everything between people. The article states that \"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\" observes Dr. Huang, \"even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression\" (Paragraph 4). This is saying that sometimes people don't put much effort into emotions like for instance smiling, sometimes people don't smile as broadly as they would like to.\r\n\r\nThis is my opinion on being able to have a computer analyze how you are feeling. I think it would be a bad idea and it would be better off to let people keep their feelings to themselves.",

The car caint since every thing like if you are sleep, if there is ice on the ground, and construction zone. When you are sleep which im sure you would end up doing do to the fact you arent realy driven can have some realy bad effects in the future more accident leading to death, and might even get arrested ffor reckless driving.\r\n\r\nAnother reason I am against driverless cars is that it takes away lots of jobs for people. Some people this effects are car dealers, vallet parkers, airport parking,\r\n\r\nand other people whithin car companies. This is a big thing alot people may be homeless if this happens.\r\n\r\nThe last reason I have is that it is a waste of time and money.

        "Have you ever heard about big faces on Mars, NASA has gone on many space trips but this time they found sothing creepy. They had found big faces made in the dust, NASA said they have never heard about anything like this before So that makes me a little scared on how they got there.\r\n\r\nI think that it is scary having planets have faces on them. these Faces were found in 1976 and it was hard to see and in 1998 and in 2001 the face got covered by sand and dust and you couldnt see it anymore. in 1976 there was a group called the Viking 1 sent by NASA. They had found a 2nd face made and it had shadows in its eyes, and mouth.\r\n\r\nThere was a big time when everyone kept talking about these faces in magazines, in social media, and in abandoned stores. \"The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in holltwood films, appered in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery stores.\"(5)\r\n\r\nSome people say that these faces are awesome and that NASA should go on the planet Mars and explore the faces on Mars. This finding was very important to tax payers. NASA had taken many pictures of these faces they even sent another space ship to go with a better camera to take better pictures.\" we felt this was important to taxpayers\", explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NAS's Mars exploration program.\" we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" (6)\r\n\r\nNASA had sent a 3rd space mission in April 5, 1998 when the space ship had passed over Cydonia the took a picture of the face.",
        "Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.\r\n\r\nStrangley, the author of \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\"\r\n\r\nsuggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was \"a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,\" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, \" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\u0097landforms common around the American West.\" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?\r\n\r\nAll in all, there is no \"true\" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature.",
        "The author supports his idea very well in this article. He has so many evidence in each paragraph. He has so many ways to back it up .

He is right on soon were gone have to find or live on a new planet other then earth. Then i agree on\r\n\r\nparagraph 2 he said venus is the closet planet to earth terms of density and sizeand occasionally the closet in distants too. In paragraph 4 it says that astronomers fascinated by venus because futher vists to its surface most earth-like planet in our solar system.\r\n\r\nWhat thing that good about this article is that has alot facts and things i didn't know about venus.

        "What Does it Look Look Like to You\r\n\r\nThe \"Face on Mars\" is just a landform. Like many other NASA scientist i do not beleive that it was an made by ancient civilazations of aliens. The pictures that we have taken from the planet Mars first indicated a type of face. But now that with our newer technology we've seen that it is just a mesa or butte. NASA has even provided real photos taken on the Mars. But still, many disagree that it is simply just a landform.\r\n\r\nNasa sending out the Viking 1 and bringing back that picture has made a big impact on NASA. Alot of scientist did not beleive that it was a face. But \"the Face on Mars\" has become a pop icon. This \"Face on Mars\" starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout linesfor 25 years. But NASA scientist were still a bit doubtfull.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 NASA felt that it was important to tax payers to see the for sure if the \"the Face on Mars\" was really a face at all. When Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural alndform. So all these people believed that it was a face but it actually turned out, from real pictures taken, to be a landform.\r\n\r\nBut still not evryone was content with that. The \"Face on Mars\" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera that took the last picture of the \"Face on Mars\" had to peer through wispy clouds to see the \"Face\".",
        "Simply think of a future in which a computer program is able to adjust itself to the needs of a student, a home-body, anyone, just by looking at their face. Imagine how powerful and monumental a change like that could be. There would be easier design of virtual lessons to individualize to each student, there's home computer use, such as playing calming music when the computer detects stress, and then there's better facial representation in things such as movies or video games, as our understanding of the expression of emotion and emotion itself grows. Although there are some concerns regarding it, the Facial Action Coding System can be slightly modified at worst if such concerns are not settled, and there are plenty of solution and measures to unwarrant such concerns.\r\n\r\nIn order for the a student to successfully learn through a lecture or a class, the number one way to ensure their overall growth as a student is maintain their engagement in whatever activity they're partaking in. One way virtual classes can become more interactive and individualized from person to person is with the Facial Action Coding System, a system that's capable of reading a person emotion through a complex algorithm and outputting a near exact description of their emotion. This kind of program could create a whole new level of interactivity in lessons by allowing a computer to be able to detect whether the student is engaged or bored, and adjusting the lesson accordingly.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but such a technology would also lead the way into a whole new level of interaction between computers and their users. For example, the Facial Action Coding System could lead the way in paving a path to more support from a computer. For instance, the use of such a program could allow a computer to detect the users emotion and be able to compensate or assist in stabilizing it, such as playing calming music when it detects its user is getting too stressed.",

It sounds pretty cool.\r\n\r\nProf. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe helped developed a way for you to know.

The new technology will help the teacher know how your feeling about the whole situation.\r\n\r\nThe teacher might push the assignment back for you because he/she knows your not feeling the day and they know it will only stress you out. I think the technology is a good advantage to have in classrooms. Teachers can know how the students feel about an activity or a project. The teachers might think its fun but the students might feel like its boring. If a student does not like a project, they dont put in as much effort.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 6 it states,\"a Web ad appears do your screen, a similar ad might follow.

        "Do you believe that Smart Cars are positive or negative to aspects of driverles cars? Some people believe that Smart Cars are a negative because was if something happens to the technology who is going to be responsbile the driver or the manufacturer. Although ,I would have to say Smart Cars are a postive, because the Smart Cars would have sensors, and speeds up to 25 miles per hour, and the Smart Car is controlled by technology so the car can control itself through accidents , break itself, amd through work zones. Adding to that, the Smart Car lets you know when there is a problem accuring and it gets your attention.\r\n\r\nFirst, Smart Cars are a postive aspect to driverless cars because the cars would have sensors. The sensors would monitor the surrounding of the Smart Car. In the aricle its says,\" auto makers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock breakes. With in 10 years, those sensor have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-controll skids or rollovers\". The sensors are placed everywhere aound the car such as:on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, and 4 automatic radar sensors etc. Meanwhile, those are just some of the places.\r\n\r\nNext, the Smart Cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. In the article it says, \" But special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In facts, non of the cars developed so far one completetely driverless. With that being said, the Smart Car isn't completely driverless, the driver is still driving just not the entire time. The driver is needed when pulling in or out of a driveway. Also when there is an accident or a problem.\r\n\r\nThen,since the Smart Cars are controlled by technology, the car can control itself through accidents,break itself, and throught work zones.",

And a car without an alert driver isnt a safe car, at least not in law makers eyes.\r\n\r\nIn states like California, Nevada, Florida, and the district of columbia it is illegal to test computer driven cars. The rest of america should follow suit though the article says, \" manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe.\" For the time being there not safe enough. though there are constant development being made to the driverless car. There are still to many hole in the ideal to make a safe apperance on the road.\r\n\r\none of the advancements is that the cars have \"Traffic Jam Asstancet.\" the article say they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\"",

Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ,\" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.\r\n\r\nSome might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century. Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters, 43 in the 1976 Viking photo. This tells everyone that they did not make their decsion based upon 20th century technology, but they captured thier photo with morden day technology.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I belive that \"The Face\" was a just a natural landform.",
        "People today and years before us have always wandered if there has been life on Mars. With one photo taken of a mysterious figure, people think they have come closer than ever to knowing if there was life long before us on another planet. \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" is a topic commonly talked about. Some say the Face was created by aliens, while others say it is the natural landform that caused it. Pictures were taken, and a conclusion have been made whether or not aliens created it, or if it was caused by a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, Viking 1 was orbiting Mars to find a landing space for their sister ship, Viking 2.\r\n\r\nWhile scouting out Mars, Viking 1 comes across an image that could likely show life on Mars. The pictured appeared to be a face, but was debated for a long time. A couple years later in 1998, the Mars Global surveyor (MGS) took a shot of the \"Face\" which revealied a naural landform.\r\n\r\nThe image shot in 1998 was ten times shaper and more clear than the one taken in 1976. Once the second picture was taken, it was released to the JPL web site showing all, that it was caused by natural landforms and that aliens were not the case. People began to say that the aliens were hidden by a haze since the camera it was taken with had to zoom through the clouds in order to take the shot.",
        "In 1976, NASA was taking pictures of Mars and found what looked like a human face looking at them. When the news got to the public they emediatly jumped to the conclution that it was an alian artifact. I can reasure you that it is nothing more than a natural landform that looks like a face.\r\n\r\nWhen NASA went back to retake pictures on April 5,1998, it showed that there was nothing at all but a nautral landform. The public still were not agreeing on it just being a landform due to them taking the pictures on a cloudy winter day.",

The article said it took about two weeks to get across the pacific ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to China. That's like sitting in vomet for a month.\r\n\r\nWhat would you have to eat every day. You can't keep food on a boat for a month. The boat would only be filled with food.

With driverless cars you never know when your going to have a accident or loose control of the car. I know I would like to have full control of the car that I am driving, not some robot car.

Some electrical difficulties could happen and you have your kid in the car how are you suppose to save the both of you. There is some many things that could go wrong and i think its just a way to big of a risk to take.These experiments on these andvances cars are unnessecary when we have perfectly fine cars today.

        "25 years ago NASA discovered a face on Cydonia, Mars. It was extrodinary looking like an egyptian face! Many people think it was a human face that aliens created, but surely enough it isn't. As a scientist from NASA I know for sure it is definitely not. NASA went into further detail with this \"Face\". We looked further into the face just to show people that this is not a face created by aliens.\r\n\r\nFurther more we found it was just another Martian mesa, common in Cydonia. Since the face was becoming popular, being in movies, magazines, radio shows, and books we had to prove that we are right. As a result in 2001 NASA took a even closer and more clear picture of this face on Cydonia. It showed that it was just illusions making the mesa look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Making this mesa look like a face. This revealed to all people that this face is just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion NASA knows more than just typical average day people. NASA has proved us wrong from thinking it is a face created by aliens.",

I am about to tell a few reasons you should do it. Here are some If you like animals, if you like exploring, if you want money, and even if you like to try new things, this would be a great thing for you.\r\n\r\nthe first reason is if like animals you would love this job. We take care of cattle. You get to feed them, brush them, clean their stall, and even lead them off the boat. You have to take care of almost 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them.\r\n\r\nAlso if you like to explore the world around you this would be a good opportunity to do so. We have visited Europe, China, and other places. I seen the Acropolis in Greece, I took a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the panama Canal on my way to China. There are some other reasons to join the program.",
        "Personally, I think that \"driverless\" cars are and would be extremely dangerous. They can't react to quick events as fast as a human can. They aren't even fully \"driverless\" to begin with, a person in the car would still have to be ready at all times in the occasion that something happens. The company or companies technology operating the car to drive automatically could malfunction and or crash at any given time while a person or people are in the vehicle. The main reasons why I don't support driverless cars are because they create an unsafe area and passengers could get too disracted on phones or devices.\r\n\r\nThe first reason why I don't support driverless cars are because they create an unsafe area for people. I say this because if Google or another company was supporting that over a car, if wouldn't be able to adapt to an area if an accident or something of that nature happpened. Weather might play an important factor on why this system may not be at it's best performance level.",
        "I cant imagine a life or a point in time where in the future people could be driving driverless cars. Can you? I thinks its okay if some people who need help driving uses them or might own one, but for everyone? Not exactly how I see the world becoming better for everyone because of that. The world evolves in many ways with transportation already now in numerous ways. The bike lanes are everywhere, people run, walk, or jog places, theres Uber thats now pretty big. But why a driverless car? So now people can become so lazy they barley have to drive? From the age where your remembering to be in a car you cant wait to be the next person to be able to drive thats somehing I & many others agree shouldnt be taken away.\r\n\r\nA driverless car seems very possible within the next few years but I dont see any reasoning behind the fact that we dont need it. Maybe for older folks who have trouble or someone having so much money for one they just get one for the fact that they want to say that they have it. Also technicaly it's not even a \"driverless\" car. You still have to be awake, aware, & control it through tough spots like a car crash, & road work.\r\n\r\nIf your in a age where your getting a permit or you already have one dont you think when you was younger, before all that, that you couldnt wait to get your car & licaens. You would think of driving somewhere with someone if you prefer that out to eat or to a store littlle things that make you feel like you accomplished something. You'd miss it right? So why have a company tell you dont have that excitment for being a legal driver & showing you can do things, & share thier dream of just being able to sit in the car for however long with who ever your with just to sit there?",
        "The Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, could be useful for school purposes, and may help students and teachers tremendously. On the otherhand, however, it is not perfect and may cause more issues than it solves.\r\n\r\nFor school purposes, the FACS can be used to alter an online course, assessment, or even just a simple knowledge check, using facial expressions to determine if the students are confused, bored, or if they understand it. If they are confused, it may be altered to help them understand whatever it is they're working on. For someone who is bored, it may try to make an online course more interesting to grasp their attention.\r\n\r\nHowever, the FACS is not perfect. It may mistake a facial expression for the wrong emotion. This could result in issues involving altering an online assessment, or course. Some students may feign emotions, and make faces to do the easier course that's meant for students who require additional help. Also, students who take an online course may be confused about something else, not the course they're taking. The FACS will still read that expression as confusion and alter it because of that confusion.",
        "Have you ever wanted to travel or see new places that normally others wouldn't have the opportunity to go see? Me, being in the Seagoing Cowboys program reccomend you to join for three reasons. By participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will be able to see unique places that some people might not have the opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nAnd so to start, I get that some people don't want to go out, or maybe they already travel the world - but, I will promise you, it's worth seeing. Some of the unique places include, well, water! Most of the trips you might be taking is going to be focused on water, and by saying that, I just hope that you may be at least a bit intrested in joining at this point. This will prove, that be joining, you will see new and unique places.\r\n\r\nSecondly, another reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it's loads of fun. Feeding the animals may be a hard task, but it sure frees you form some of the bordom on the boat or ship. Yes, some people don't like animals, and I get that, but it doesn't mean that they won't have even a bit of fun, there's so much more for you to explore if you just look! You can go and kill some time with the animals, and feed them when needed. At night, if you're assigned to the animals, you have to go check on them every hour. It really does seem like alot, but I don't think that anybody would want an animal, or animals, around the ship lurking around, messing up peoples things.",

        "Many people believe technology is becoming too advanced for our own good. Maybe they were right, technology is advancing at a rapid rate and can also invade one's privacy. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author describes a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions such as happy, sad, disgust, surprised, and a few other basic emotions. There is debate whether this software should become avaible in classrooms for students and if it is valuable. It is not very valuable, it is an invasion of privacy to use this software to read a students' emotional responses to their work.\r\n\r\nSchools around the world are becoming more and more advanced everyday. Students, freshman through seniors, at Floyd Central High School along with hundreds of tother high schools have ipads that students carry around and use in their everyday classes. If they were to have this new software it would not change very many things. \"For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different.\" What does web ads have to do with a student's education? This only shows that students will be recorded at all times through their ipads and/or computers while they do their school work. This is a huge invasion of privacy to students everywhere who might have to use this new emotional expression software.\r\n\r\nThe article states, \" \"A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr Huang predicts.\"Then it could modify the lesson, like the effective human instructor.\" \" Though it sounds like a step towards the right direction in technology, students will be just as bored doing random classwork on a computer without emotion software watching their every move through a camera. Also, at least 60% of students do better with a teacher in front of them to help rather than learning things online. If this software acts as a effective human instructor, students will still grow confused because as the article states that \"...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.\".",
        "Some people believed that the \"Face on Mars\" was an alien monument, and still do. This was a conspiracy theory that had been proven wrong many times by us scientists at NASA. When we first discovered this face, there was a degree of surprise among the mission controllers. But they soon figured it was another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Only this one had different shadows that gave the appearance of an Egyption Pharaoh, which caused the theories of it being an extra terrestrial monument.\r\n\r\nWhen we had unveiled the photograph of the rock formation out into the public, it had been captioned that it was a \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" This had been done to attract attention, and it did. People began to think the Face was evidence of life on Mars that NASA would rather hide. But, our NASA budgeters wish there was life on Mars because it would benefit our investigations and bring in more money. NASA would have abosolutely no reason to hide this information from the public.\r\n\r\nYet, theorists are unconvinced. On April 5, 1998, we sent the Mars Global Surveyor to fly over Cydonia and to take photographs that were ten times sharper than the original photos. We first uploaded these images onto a JPL website, explaining that the Face was a natural landform and that it was not a monument built by aliens.\r\n\r\nPeople were still not satisfied with our information at this point. Our mission controllers prepared to inspect the Face again. This time, our controllers used a camera that spanned 1.56 meters on the maximum resolution, which captured a breath-taking image. This image shows that the Face is an equivalent of a butte or mesa. This is a common landform on Earth, and proves that the Face on Mars is just an oddly shaped area of land.\r\n\r\nI do understand why people may have thought that this landform was evidence of life on Mars, but us workers at NASA gave real evidence that it wasn't.",
        "Driverless Cars and Their Risks\r\n\r\nThe concept of driverless cars, does not appeal to me whatsoever. I do not agree with the manufactoring of these cars because I do not find the concept of a driverless car to be safe. Trusting technology with something as important as driving, is nothing short of dangerous. Think of it this way, do you know that feeling of when your computer freezes? Or when your television goes out? T.V.'s and computers are some of the basic essentials of technology. They have their bugs, and they do not run flawlessly 24/7. Driverless cars can be the same way too. They can freeze and have their bugs. Are you willing to risk you and your loved ones lives with a driverless car?\r\n\r\nI certainly wouldn't and by the end of this eassy, I hope you won't risk it either.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars have been fantasized for many years. Google employees such as Sergey Brin and Sebastian Thrun claim that this fantasy is close to becoming a reality. I, for one haven't really heard any news on the matter. Sure, the rumors were there, but I honestly haven't heard of any of these breakthroughs. I don't trust it. I, and many other people want to see true facts and real results. The fantasy of driverless cars clouds people's judgement and so with such little public attention and news coverage, I honestly can see why me and so many others are skeptical of this idea.\r\n\r\nStates like California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia, have outlawed these cars. They believe that having a human driver is the safest and smartest way to drive a car. And their right.\r\n\r\nTechnology is nothing short of unpredictable, as anything can happen. A phone can shut down, a computer can catch a virus, and a T.V. can blow out. Who knows what a driverless car can do? At least if a car breaks down, the human driver has some degree of control over the matter.",
        "My point on driverless cars, I would not like to see them on the road because they can cause accidents or injuries/death. Also, they can cause serious complications on someone's life if they were injured by the driverless car.\r\n\r\nThey don't have the quick response like humans do when they drive, plus if they are on the road when its slick and they don't know to be slow when on slick roads they can cause accidents. The question would be if the driverless cars were to get into an accident, whose fault would it be? If the human driver didn't cause it should the company get fault for it and even get sued? Or should the human driver take the blame since they are human and actually driving a car. The company who manufactured the car should take full responsibily with the accident. The driverless cars could malfunction and cause a serious or life-threatening car crash to the human driver on the other side of the rucus. Many people don't want driverless cars on the road so people won't get hurt first off, and secondly they don't want them on the road so they won't mess up and cause harm. Although the driverless cars have humans on standby, they still shouldn't be made because of all the safety hazards it could cause on the other people and the technology that was built into the car, its essentially a waste of money to make a car thats driverless and it gets wrecked beyond repair.",
        "The \"Evening Star\" or otherwise known as Venus is a very dangerous planet. Despite the planet being close to us, we haven't sent any spacecrafts there in the past 30 years. The reason has alot to do with the fact that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus\u0092s atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOn the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which means that its alot of times hotter than the surface of our planet. The atmospheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, why would we want to go back there.\r\n\r\nThe reason is because Astronomers think that the Venus was once an earth like planet. They believe that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Adding more into this is that today, Venus has some features such as mountains and valleys.\r\n\r\nNASA has come up with an idea on how they would live in\r\n\r\nVenus safely and productive. The idea is to allow scientist to float above ground. About 30 miles to be exact. With them hovering 30 miles above ground they should be safe from the ground conditions. With that, NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus; such as an device that was used in World War 2 that calculates under high pressure of heat and does not require electricity.",

One example of this is that the car could malfuction its self while driving automatically. In the article it nevers explain what the car would do in a car accident or even when damaged.

What if the driverless car so happenes to malfinction? The possiblities are endless when it comes to the things that could go wrong, when it comes to driverless cars.\r\n\r\nIf you think you are prepared for driving then I think you should know all the tasks you have to do and be able to perform them tasks while driving. The person driving should be responsible and be very aware of his surrounding, and they should always be alert. If you think you should be driving then you have to be responsible for yourself and the others around you. Not only is your life on the line so is theirs. You shouldnt have to rely on electronics and computers to help you drive. That may also make you forget about the rules of driving.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I think it would be awesome if we didn't have to drive ourselves around.",
        "Twenty Five years ago, something oddly strange happend on Mars. The NASA spacecraft, Viking 1 had caught a photo on the red planet that had a very strong identical look to a human face. Many scientist thought it was the work of aliens but here are some facts to prove that this theory is incorrect. Through the process of movie films, books and other things people used to explain this phenonmean, and through scientifical evidence.\r\n\r\nWhen the news spread about the strange human face on Mars, many people became interested in the fact that aliens could have been responsibel for this event. To surpise the face on Mars has become a popular icon, with many Hollywoodfilms, books, magazines, and even talk shows. This greatly increased the number people going with the idea that aliens could be the cause of this but this idea is false. In the atricle \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", it talks about on April 5,1998 that the Mars Global Surveyor was launched over Mars to check the so called alien monument. While using the Mars Orbiter Camera, Micheal Malin and his crew used his ten time sharp vision to scan the \"alien monument\" and found out it was just a natural lanform.\r\n\r\nEven though the scince had proved that the strange face on Mars was just a landform, not alot of people were convinced. However, Science once agian came out to prove once and for all that it was indeed a landform.

        "Venus is the second planet from our sun, and it is periodically referred to as earth's twin. Both planets have the same size and density, but the similarities stop there. The atmosphere of Venus consists of 97% carbon doxide, clouds of sulfuric acid, and the hottest surface temperetue of any planet orbitting the sun. Despite this, scientists have tried to send unmanned spacecrafts to the surface of Venus. Scientists think that Venus may have been the most earthlike planet, with the planets surface like valleys and mountains and possible evidence of oceans that may have existed long ago. The author believes that it is worthy to continue trying to explore Venus despite its dangers.\r\n\r\nThe author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining the similarities that Venus has with the Earth and indicating that Venus is the closest planet to the Earth. In the text it states, \"...Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" This quote supports my claim because the author gives some evidence that Venus had some sort of body of water. The author might believe that Veus can be habitable. Another piece of information supporting my claim states, \" ...recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.\"",
        "Driverless cars have both positve and negatives aspects, but I personally do not think that we should have them on our streets. They are too complicated for people. I do not think they will ever actually be on the street because of how dangerous they are. Multiple states have already outlawed the testing of driverless cars. I am siding with those states because, driverless cars are dangerous, they will make people even lazier then what they already are, and a lot of people probably would not be able to afford these cars.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are dangerous because everything is controlled by a computer, the passenger is not in control at all times. Traffic laws state that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. If there is a passenger in a driverless car, and the car begins to malfunction and the passenger gets injured or even dies, whose fault will it be? The passenger or the manufacturer?\r\n\r\nDriverless cars just make things so much more complicated, I think most people would rather drive their own cars anyways, because they will feel as if they are control of everything, rather than having a computer control everything for you.\r\n\r\nAnother reason driverless cars are bad is because they will make America even lazier then it already is today. People in this country do not like doing anything for themselves, driverless cars will just make everything even worse. If people do not have to drive, then they will act as if they do not have to do other things. Not having to drive just leads to more and more lazy actions down the road. I think their are certain things that people will always need to do for themselves, and driving is one of them.\r\n\r\nCars that are controlled manually are already expensive enough. I can only imagine how expensive driverless cars will be.",
        "The author supports this idea by introducing us to the planet and stating key points about Venus early on in the passage. In paragraph one he says, \"In our solar system Venus is the second planet from our sun.\" and that's showing us that the author is intrested in studying Venus. In paragraph two he begins to talk about the different speeds in which Venus, Earth and Mars travel. The author states in the third sentence of paragraph two, \"These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus\".\r\n\r\nAs the author states in the third paragragraph, \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...\" Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author has to be fully intrested in Venus to know this much about the planet. You will learn that Venus is a dangerous planet and not even metal can survive on Venus's surface. The author states in paragraph two, \"Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades\". Venus is so dangerous that in order to visit the planet you can't even land, you would have to float about 30 miles from the ground.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Venus is not impossible to visit in fact NASA is still working on getting astronauts there with different approaches.",
        "\"Unmasking the Face on Mars\"\r\n\r\nThe article On the Face on Mars is very interesting, states facts,and some opinions. When the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling then planet Mars it was takikng photographs forl posiible landing sites for Viking 2 spacecraft. But when doing its job itk discovered something unusaul and different about the red planet. What the spacecraft dikscovered that was so\r\n\r\nmysterious to NASA scientist was an enormous face structure neaerly two miles from end to end. Many of some people who work for NASA say it was just another Martian mesa that was common on Mars. Could this be a natural landform or a sign form of another life form.\r\n\r\nBut this stuctuer or landform had Shadows that made it look like an Eygyptian Phharoah. Days later NASA revealed the photograph and the caption read \"huge rock formation...wich resembles a human head...formed by a shwdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Others say that the face was built or made by another life form. But others are wrong, because there are many ways this landform couldve been built by natural land.",
        "Technology is so amazing nowadays. Imagine a technology that could tell your emotion...well, it is a thing. The technology that can see and detect your emotion, it is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology could be very useful in some situations. Professer Thomas Huang is the inventer behind this magnificent technology, also with the help of Professer Nicu Sebe. Professer Thomas and his colleague are very brilliant and are coming up with better ways for computers to be even more smart. This technology may even be useful in classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe Facial Action Coding system can tell your emotions. It all starts when the computer comes up with a 3-D model of the face it will be indentifying the emotion for, it will look at the 44 biggest, and most useful muscles of the face, any movemnt of any muscle can show how you are feeling and the emotion you have. The muscle called frontalis pars lateralis, is the muscle that moves and does the most when you have an excited or suprised emotion. The muscle called the orbicularis oris is the muscle around your mouth that tightens when you are angered.\r\n\r\nThe Facial Action Coding System can detect all emotions. If you are happy, sad, angry, suprised, disgusted, or in a state of fear, the Facial Action Coding system can detect the emotion. The image may not always show a singe emotion, the model being shown could be happy, but still could be in fear of something, the technology will detect it. The technology can detect a single emotion, yet it can detect weather an image has a mixed emotion.\r\n\r\nThe Mona Lisa picture is a good example to use explaining this technology.",
        "I think that it is good that smart cars are being made because say if someone is paying attention to the road and doing something with there child like giving there baby a toy or something and there eyes are off the road then nothing is there to help stop the car. A smart car is a good thing to have because it will most likely lower the amount of crashes that happen even year and even drop the death rate per year. So i think smart cars are a good idea because say if your having a hard time parking your car then the car can do it for you? If someone is drinking and driving or texting and driving then that car can save someones from causing a death or injury.",
        "The invention of this new device could be helpful in many ways. I believe it could help with studies done on students and how they react to certain activities done online or in class and what emotions are expressed in general. It could also help with preventative measures in children and students that are depressed and can be helped. This new technology is useful and helpful in so many ways. Not only could this new technology be used as a facial decoding system, it could be used to tell what the students emotional status is.\r\n\r\nAs i said before the Facial Action Coding System could not only be used for study on students but on babies and adults. This device could help with disabled children and adults, children with birth defects and syndromes. It could help them with gaining knowlegde in emotions and how to tell when someone is mad, sad, etc. , maybe even how to properly show emotions.\r\n\r\nBack to the idea of reading student's facial expressions, it can be helpful in finding ways to make learning more fun for students and ways to make certain activities easier.

However, advanced technology has caused many problems, as it has also been effective.\r\n\r\nThere are certain things \"man\" should control themselves; automotives is one. Yes, a assemly line is much more easier than carrying heavy things to where they need to be, but completely removing a person from an object that can easily end a life is not only lazy, but abserb. Us as humans were given one specifc thing that seperates us from everything else; a brain.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the prompt, if an accident occurs, who will be held responsible?

The car may have an overide system, but a human will not be able to react quick enough in that split second in the chaos that the robot has created.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain things robots will thrive in that humans don't. For instance, a \"whiskey throttle\". This is when a human panics and gets a heavy foot, which causes an accident that was not intended. Robots do not panic, therefore, they will not rear-end the car ahead of them.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\"\r\n\r\nmay look like an alien has constructed it but the shadows of the bumps make it seem like it is an actual human face. If it were aliens who had built the Face on Mars, wouldn't there be more? The answer to that question would\r\n\r\nbe yes. The pictures from 2001 show that that the artifact was really just a natural creation. Before scientists had found the Face on Mars, the question is...just how old is it?\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the aricle it states,\"New high-resolution images and 3D alimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa\" (UTFONM, 1). Thus meaning that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. Before the pictures in 1976 and 98' were awful quality, the picture in 2001 shows exactly what the Face on Mars is. The article also stated that the Face on Mars,\"...huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by the shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth\" (UTFONM, 1). This is proof of it only being a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIf aliens had created this form, wouldn't there be more of these human looking landforms. There is no evidence in the article that states aliens were the creatures who made the Face on Mars. If the Face on Mars was created by aliens, NASA would have wanted to research it instead of hiding it because they would've gotten paid. According to the article it states, \" Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" (UTFONM, 1). It would have been beneficial to NASA if it were made by aliens.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to infer that it could only be a structure made by aliens because who knows the capabilities of these creatures.",

The man continues to argue with me and say that aliens are real and this alien artifact looks like a human face. I have to keep telling him that this is just a natural landform which is called a butte or mesa. This certain mesa looks like a face only because it shows most of the characteristics that a human has such as; the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth which are all just formed by shadows. The man asked how does NASA know that this rock formation that you \"supposedly\" think, is a mesa? He just thinks that it's a sign of aliens. I tell him that Nasa was able to figure it out because a mesa is a a big rock formation that just has a flat top and thats what the face looked like if you see it up close. He still did not believe me. I told him we will find out and we did.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 2001, our team NASA (including me), got a clear picture of this \"face\". The Mars Global Surveyor went just close enough for a look at the Face which was the perfect cloudless day. NASA was able to get a picture many times more clearer than the 1976 Viking photo.\r\n\r\nMany people who thought that the \"face\" was an alien artifact were waiting to see Nasa release how the picture looks like.",
        "Many companys out there are striving for driverless cars. It's an innovation that has been predicted for decades. There is, however, some problems that can occur with the automated car. Most people would think of this as an argument of if A.I. should drive, or if humans should, but I believe it's more like an argument between the human error or the limited thought capacity of a computer.\r\n\r\nThe thought of automated control has been thrown around in many subjects such as border control turrets to androids. It's also been a popular science fiction subject for movies like The Matrix and iRobot. In both of those movies, the A.I. takes control over humanity. If certain disasters were to happen, the A.I. wouldn't know what to do while a human could.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the automated car could save lifes. Many people each year die in car crashes, and alot of those crashes are drunk/distracted drivers. In an automated car, the human could be drunk and the car's performance wouldn't be affected. If only the human couldn't drive the car, nobody would be able to speed, or get in car chases. Car related deaths would go down for sure.",

And also scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact. I know this because in the article it states, \"The caption noted a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" This shows that there is no alien activity on Mars and that there's just shadows that forms the human shaped head.\r\n\r\nTwenty five years ago NASA found a human shaped head on the planet of Mars.

        "Driverless cars would be a huge problem honestly. if they crash who will pay for the damages done? they also wouldnt be cheap to build.\r\n\r\nFirst off they would be dangerous, because we already have drivers that go above the speed limit. now if we had driverless cars and this person could some how go really fast and he isnt paying attention to the road there will be a car crash. another thing some people still text while driving so their eyes wont be on the road it will be on their phone and then an accident could happen.\r\n\r\nBuilding these driverless cars will obviously take alot of money to build cause of all the extra parts that will be need to keep them on the road. they would also be sold at a really high price as well because who wouldnt want a car that could drive on its own.\r\n\r\nHumans would be more efficent at driving then the car driving alone. maybe the censor that keeps the car on the road goes out or anything could happen to the technoolgy in the car that is keeping the car going could mess up and result in a accident.\r\n\r\nWho would be paying for the accidents?",
        "These driverless cars should not be developed becuase technology can crash, safety concerns and lack of knowledge. These 3 reasons all tie up to each other on why these cars should not be developed.\r\n\r\nFirst reason why driverless cars should not be developed is becuase technology is not one hundred percent reliable. Technology can crash causing these cars to possibly not be functioning well which could lead to various accedents and who will take initiative for those damages? \u00a8If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\u00a8 paragraph 9. With this being said anyone can buy things that make their life easier, thats what everyone wants right? Not just becuase it makes your life easier means its safe.\r\n\r\nSecond, these cars should not be developed becuase of safety concerns. As already mentioned technology can crash leading to serious injuries, the sensors could stop working leaving huge possibilities of many crashes. Does this also mean that if these cars replace actual cars does that mean people will become lazier and or not be requiered to drive or have a liscence if indeed this project becomes successful?\r\n\r\nLastly, these cars should not be developed because of lack of knowledge. Again, if these cars replace driver cars does that mean people will become lazier, and or not be requiered to have a liscence if this porject indeed becomes successful?

Many believe it's an alien monument, many believe it's a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIt has been proven that the Face is a natural landform, but not everyone seems to agree. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equilvalent of a buttle or mesa, which are common landforms around the American West. Also, there are no scientific facts that aliens are real. Conspiracy theories lack credability. They question NASA, and conpiracy theorists believe that NASA is trying to hide something from them. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times shaper than the Viking photos.

It is a photo of small region of mars with a couple of formations. But one formation sticks out like a tall man in an elementary school. This picture was taken at the right angle at the right time. It makes it look a face with the angle and shadows. And many people believed it to be a monument made by extratellestular figures. Another reason why they believe for it to be made from aliens is because, \u00a8What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\u00a8\r\n\r\nTheir is a lot of people that would disagree with belief of this face being real. They would believe this way because they would it\u00b4s childish to believe that a rock formation on a foreign planet could ever possibly be made by aliens. Another reason why is because if it does resemble a earth-like formation that was not man made, that means the face was made by aliens, it was just an act of nature. It is physically challenging to make a formation, the shape of a human face, on a planet way far away from its neighboring planets.",

In paragraph seven where it says all the information it says \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is actually not a face but a natural landform for the following reasons, the facial features are just shadows, there isn't any real proof that aliens created it, and scientists have research that is proof of it not being alien-made.\r\n\r\nThe first reason is the facial features are just shadows. It would be nice if it was actually nad by an alien. Sadly, it isn't true. It is proven that it is actually just a huge rock formation. (Paragraph 3) \"The authors reasoned it would be good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. (Paragraph 3)\r\n\r\nSecondly, there isn't actual proof that aliens created it anyways. There isn't any proof that aliens are even completely real. It is said in the article \"Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" (Paragraph 8). So, they do not have any actual real proof.\r\n\r\nMy last reason is that scientists have done research to prove that aliens did not really creat this face in Mars. Scientists had seen this photeo in the winter of April '98. Someone would have to peer through the camera through wispy clouds. (paragraph 8).\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for believing aliens did it is that people want to believe. They want to believe that another race of people can exsist. Maybe the aliens are jsut sending a message that they are real. Wem will never really know for sure sadly.\r\n\r\nYou can belioeve what you would like to.

If the cars computer was to brake down u cant use it at all but with a normal car you can replace cars and have it working again.\r\n\r\nThe last thing i think it would be alot saffer and have faster moving traffic and going to places faster if we didnt have the driverless cars.",

They also say things like \"Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere,\" and \"the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet,\" basically emphasizing that Venus would be almost impossible to explore because of the extreme harsh conditions on the planet.\r\n\r\nFirst off, in paragraph 3 the author writes \"Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" This is the author suming up how impossible it would be to travel there with the technology scientists have today. They even state \"such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans.\" By saying this they are even supporting the fact that scientists can't get there with the technology they have now.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the only support the author has for even traveling to Venus in the first place, is that it is closely related to the planet Earth having features like valleys and mountains. In paragraph 4 he writes \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" So basically the only reason we should spend the billions of dollars it would take to travel there, is because it is somewhat similar to our planet. The only other support the author has for traveling there is the point that it is the closest planet for planetary visit.

The first thing that you have wrong is that the Face seen on Mars is of alien orgin. The Face that you see in the picture is just an oddly shaped Martian mesa. In fact there are very common on that region of Mars so for all we know there could very well be more oddly shaped mesas in that area.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that you miss read the caption of the picture or didn't even look at it at all. If you would've you should have seen the caption stating that the reason it resembles a human head is because of the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The only reason the let people see that photo is because they wanted more people to be intrested more in Mars.\r\n\r\nPlus on April 5, 1998 NASA reaveled to everyone on their website the Face was mearly an oddly shapped Natural landform.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion there are several ways that we could disprove your statement. The first being that it is just a mesa which dosen't have a distinct form, which means that if another one forms it could very well be a dog or a cat. The second being that you may have just miss read or not have read the caption.",

Landforms such as this exist on Earth and high-quality images have been taken showing a normal landform on the surface of Mars.\r\n\r\nOne reason we know the Face was not created by aliens is because of it's similarities to landforms on earth. The Face is \"the Martian equivalent\" of landforms common to the American West called mesas. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, commented on the similarities. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" The fact that the Face resembles a natural landform here on Earth supports the idea of the Face also being a natural landform.\r\n\r\nNot only does the Face have similarities to natural landforms on Earth, higher quality pictures of it have been taken since 1976. In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia where the Face was located. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team \"snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original image\". The photo was uploaded to a JPL web site where thousands were waiting for a picture. A natural landform was revealed. \"There was no alien monument after all\".\r\n\r\nSome people, however, were not convinced. \"Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by a haze.\" People believed the clouds had blocked the view of \"alien markings\". In 2001, on a \"cloudless summer day\".",
        "In this writing prompt I will be supporting the authors argument. The author belives that Venus should be explored and belives exploring Venus would bring plentiful information that could help the world learn more about other plantes and ours. But for this to be an arguemnt there must be a danger or bad factor, the bad harmful factor is the dangers on Venus. Venus has many dangers that has harmed unmanned spacecrafts. More dangers will be explained further in the prompt.\r\n\r\nVenus is often called Earths twin, Venus is the planet that is most related to earth in terms of density and size. But Venus has many more dangers than Earth. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide wich means humans will not be able to breath the air. Venus's surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than earths pressure. Because of the extremely high amount of pressure that would crush a submarine and melt any metal humans would nto be caple of landing on the surface of Venus without being crushed. And not only does Venus have very high tempertures, pressure and a deadly atmosphere, it also has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.\r\n\r\nSo why would we want to explore Venus if it is so inhospitable? Venus may have once had been like earth, with oceans and lifeforms. Venus does have a rocky surface with valleys, moutains and craters. Venus could be the human races next planet to inhabit if an incident would occur to Earth. Venus is the planet that is most like earth with its terrain and possible past life and water. Although Venus has its deadly dangers to humans, scientists are creating ways for humans to explore Venus and learn about this twin planet.\r\n\r\n\" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\"",
        "Luke had no idea that his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.\r\n\r\nIn 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.\r\n\r\nIt took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.\r\n\r\nBeing a Seagoing cow was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. \"Im grateful for the opportunity,\"he says. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion Luke had the best time of his life being a Seagoing Cowboy he didn't no his life would change so soon after his high school graduation.",

But Venus's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees, it is 90 times greater than what we experience on the Earth. I don't think we could live there.But NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, not easy comditions, but survivale for humans.\r\n\r\nAuthor saids strining to meet challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becaus human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

In 1945 they recieved there orders to New Orleans and they arrived August 14, 1945. Eventually, they headed to Greece with 335 horses also with eniugh hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned the age 18 before arriving to greece which meant he could be ready to participate for military service. When they learned he was on a cattle boat they told me to keep doing what I was doing. Luke had made 9 trips, more than any Seagoing Cowboy ever. It was an amazing opportunity for Luke, he loved visiting ancient things. Luke didn't just have to me stuck in a boat with horses he got to also go out and adventure. It took 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean, from the eastern coast of the United States. Also another month to get china, this seems like hard work.

        "Having driverless cars is a great idea, but it could also be bad. It all depends on the person in the car and what types of decisions they're making. I think the world could work better with these cars. Although I also believe that these types of cars can be dangerous.\r\n\r\nIf businesses and manufacturers really wanted to, they could make these dream cars a reality. The cars that we have now are pretty close to being completly driver independent. All we would need to do is give the cars a few more updated sensors to replace the drivers. The updated sensors would act as the human reflexes; therefore creating better driving conditions. Hopefully this would create less wrecks or accidents.\r\n\r\nAlso these driverless cars should have updated satelites and cameras, so when there is a detour or road construction it will automatically update the cars route. This will help backed up traffic a lot. If these cars could have the best technology that's out there today, they would already be a success. For now that's the only thing that's keeping the cars from success.\r\n\r\nSome people may be worried about the safety of these cars becasue at any moment in time there could be a glitch in the computer software, and that small glitch could cause an accident any second of any day. I, on the other hand, am not worried about that, becasue even if one car has a giltch there will be many other smartcars on the road to help avoid an accident.",
        "I believe driverless cars are coming, because of Technology, safety and the world's view on this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nThe technology we have today is the technology we need for driverless cars. Granted the cost of the technology is not affordable for everyday buys. \"The smart road systems work well\" said by google employers. They believe the upgrade need for the driverless car brings them a step closer to actually putting it on the market. Apparently , the cars needs new starters for it.\r\n\r\nGoogle used the toyota Primus radar sensor, a GPS reciever and an inertial motion sensor to upgrade the starter. They use the combination of all these different materials\r\n\r\nto impersonate a human driving the car.\r\n\r\nThe safety of the car is a big factor leading into the future. The google car has went more than half a million miles without a crash. I do not know too many people who drive now that have went that long without being in some kind of car crash. The safety is also more effecient because it alerts the driver to when they need to take over. The motion sensor\r\n\r\nmakes sure the driver hands never leave the wheel. These features are game changers to how people drive from here forward.\r\n\r\nI believe the world will accept the change to driverless cars . I think the cars would hit the market and sell a trendmendous amount as soon as they release. The technology to these cars are nothing new like the sensors or the radios . They are just used in a different way than before to increase a car technology and safety of others. The cars would say some energy from the engine through the sensors.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion to the topic of driverless cars is they will eventually happen.",
        "We found a face on landforms on Mars. Some think it was an alien life form and others think it was just a shadow. The faces on the landforms are shadows that show an illusion of a face.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the face in the pictures they all look like huge landforms with a face. Most of those pictures with a face shows the eyes, nose, and mouth all look darker than the face itself. Other scientist here proved that the eyes, nose, and mouths on these landforms are shadows. \"The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.'\"",

The diverless cars are smart in many ways that normal cars aren't.\r\n\r\nThey are not completely driverless but the are very close. The diverless cars are a wise choice for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Diverless cars have many cool gadget that makes the car safer. The car comes with a Spinning sensor on the roof which is laser beams constantly updating 3D model of the car surroundings. The diverless car also has a video camera on the rear view mirror that is always watching the diver, to insure that they are always paying attention. The car also has 4 atomotive sensors, and a GPS recevier. As you can see all of these things make the car safe and easy.\r\n\r\nThese cars are not completley driverless, they do need human skills in some senarios, such as when the car approches a car accedent it would need the driver to drive through it. If this were to happen then the car would vibrte the drivers seat to warn them that there is a dangerous situation and they need to intervine. Other than that the car can do many things it can steeer its self, accelerate, and brake with no human help required.\r\n\r\nThe diverless cars are not legal everywhere yet.",

        "I vow against the value of using technology to read student's emotional expressions. My reasoning is big data companies will configure this to their advantage and bordeom in a classroom can guide someone toward something higher.\r\n\r\nTo begin,\"Big Brother\" will exploit this in order to make money off of it unsuspectedly. The text gives an example of what the technology can do in terms of personalizing ads. It does not matter who someone is big data companies, will find clever ways of gathering anyones data in exchange making life more simple no matter if that person is student or not. Once the data is stockpiled, it is on the internet and avaliable to anyone that pays for it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, bordeom as terrible as it sounds is good for the brain. Bordeom in the text is mentioned as something that looms in the learning environment and this new technology can help create a more effective lesson. The second society lets such algorithms coexist with AI that is when the people lose control of their lives; because, it will let robotic minds make decisions for society.

        "I believe that driverless cars are pointless. They aren't really driverless, there are laws in some states against testing driverless cars, the traffic laws are written assuming that it is most safe to have a human driving the car & you don't know who will be to blame if an accident or something goes wrong.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars aren't fully driverless. The driver still has to take over when pulling in and out of driveways & dealing with complicated traffic issues. For example, navigating through roadwork or an accident. What's the point of having a driverless car, when you still have to be alert and paying attention? People want a driverless car so they don't have to do any work.Many people don't pay attention sometimes or get distracted while driving. This a dangerous disadvantage. The driver could be distracted and get into an accident because they weren't paying attention and didn't take over the car when they needed to.\r\n\r\nThe laws for driving rely on an alert driver to achieve safety while driving. Today, traffic laws are written assuming that the only way a car is safe is if it has a human driver in control at all times. In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars.Manufacturers hope that more states will allow them if they are proven to be more safe. However, if there is an accident involving a driverless car who will be to blame the manufacturer or the driver?\r\n\r\nDriverless cars also require a lot of sensors to mimic the controls of a human driver.Google's modified Toyota Prius uses sensors on the left rear wheel. on the roof, a video camera near the rear view mirror, four radar sensors, GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor.",
        "My agrument for this passage is that although theses cars seem to be really nice and might help save people from accidients and save money they may not be the best option. Driving is a very serious thing and in this agrument I'm going to tell why i think that they shouldn't be made. Driving can always need improvement why not keep the cars we have and help them out and keep people driving what they own. Plus money is a very important aspect in this agrument, having a driveless car can cost lots of money.\r\n\r\nPeople who drive can say that they don't like driving all the time but most can say that they enjoy getting to drive if we have cars that are driveless that takes away the fun that people have. If we make these driveless cars that means that the newer generations with not know how to drive cars. People will not want ot get put as much if we have driveless cars. I don't think that people have the money to spend on these cars to drive them so we may have lots of people walking if we were to switch to these cars.\r\n\r\nIf driveless cars are made they is a very big possibility that people will not want to pay attention to the roads and that will cause more accidents than what there already is. Even though the drive is suppose to watch the road when in the car still doesn't mean that people wont think that the car can do it all on its own. They will not watch the road as much as what they do now and it can cause wrecks that are not needed.\r\n\r\nHaving drivers have a driveless car is not a good idea because they willl think it is okay to play on their phones and mess around in the car. The car may have antilock brakes but that does not mean that the car is completely save for being accident free. If we have teenagers that are driving in these cars they might think that it is expectable to play around even more than what they do now. Maybe adding things to cra sthat we have now and giving them some newer safety assets might be the solution to our problem.",
        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. As driverless cars are becoming a new deveoping technology, it's best to ask yourself, \"Are driverless cars really a necessity?\" The answer is, no, they are not a necessity for many reasons. We should not continue to develope driverless cars mainly because; driverless cars are not completely driverless, the car would need a new built-in entertainment system to put inside of the car, and if something were to go wrong with the car, who is to blame for this?\r\n\r\nWhen you hear the words, \"driverless car\" what comes to mind? Perhaps, you think of a car that can take you anywhere, and young teens the age of thirteen not needing an adult to drive them to a desired destination. However, driverless cars are not 100% driverless. In the article, the cars are said to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, because of this an alert driver is said to still be required. People are still needed to be able to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Manufacturers are still working on creating new ways to alert the driver when human skills are needed, but it is no secret that this will continue to cost money.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why we should not have driverless cars, is because to have them, companies think a built-in entertainment system should be created, installed and required inside of all driverless vehicals. Today, we already have vehicals that contain a television inside for the passengers who occupy the back seats, to help keeped them entertained. This new entertainment system is said to shut off when the car needs the driver to take over and will not be available to a driver who is texting or using their phone in any way.",
        "When we use facial expressions it lets the person you are directing the expressions to know how we are feeling. We smile because we are happy, we frown because we are sad, we raise our eyebrows because we are shocked or surprised. We use usually identify those pretty well, but a computer can identify them better. I am for the value of using techology to read student's emotional expressions because teachers need to know what bores them or what excites them.\r\n\r\nWhen I first began to read this, I thought how can technology read our emotions? Then it states in paragraph 3 that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. With all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like human muscles. This computer can identify 6 basic emotion: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. With that type of skill, teachers can know what students like and don't like.\r\n\r\nStudents get easily bored when it comes to school. When they come into the classroom, they don't want to do the homework or the classwork that was given to them.",

The author did a very good job of explaining the reasons on why Venus is the closest planet to Earth , however he did leave out a few important ideas. The author failed to mention cost, reason, and a plan to actually get to Venus. A trip to Venus has a lot of reprecussions that the author didn't explain.\r\n\r\nThe author failed to bring up cost on why we should explore Venus. He did so purposely because the astrinomical cost of making a trip to Venus is far greater than our need of another planet. The obstacles scientists and astronauts have to overcome sound very expensive. In the text it states that Venus's average surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and that atmospheric pressure on Venus is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These 2 obstacles, around a 700 degree temperature increase and 90 times greater pressure than on Earth would require a lot of funds to overcome these problems.",
        "\"Are driverless cars coming?\" I'm against driverless cars because of saftey, cost, and law.\r\n\r\nTo begin, i'm against the driverless car because of the saftey issues. In the article it says that \"if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture\". Also in the article it points out, driverless cars have light signals to indicate traffic jams and other saftey issues.(What if a person is on a phone or is not paying attention and a car comes out in front of them and the signals dont show in time and someone is hurt).Another saftey problem is the antilock breaks. As you can see their are many things that can go wrong with this car showing that it's not yet saftey to be on the road.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the driverless car is a long way from being perfect because of the cost. The cars need smart roads to function. So the cost will fly up because of the updates to support the car. An supporting detail from the article is, \"These smart roads systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\" People that is less fortunate that wants to by the \"eco saving\" car would have to pay a enormous amount of money to get this brain car. Another detail from the passage is, Without the option of smarter roads, manufactures turned to smarter cars...\" If the manufactures didn't upgrade the roads they had to upgrade the car but it's still a major amount of money going in these cars. So this means what they paid to upgrade the car is going to double when someone wnats to buy it. The expens of this so called smart car is not worth buying.",

        "I believe that driverless cars should not be built. They seem like a good idea at the first look but imagine there would be so many downsides to owning one of these vehicles. First of all they would be extremely expensive to build and buy and the delicate snesors used in these vehicles could easly be broken or damaged. Also people would have the ability to hack into the servers that would run these vehicles and essentially make them do whatever they wanted, whether it be to wreck or cause an accident. And what would happen if one of these vehicles were to malfunction and cause the death of a driver, passenger, or pedestrian. I feel there are too many risks and downsides to be producing these vehicles.\r\n\r\nEven if we were to make these vehicles mainstream and sell them people would find something wrong with them like they always do. And if not that they would find ways around safety measures added to the vehicles. For example preasure sensors could be added to the steering wheel to only allow the cars to drive if someone has there hands on it, but someone could just tightly wrap tape or something else around the wheel instead and cause an accident.",

        "Have you ever been really bored of something, but your teacher in class can't tell? The Facial Action Coding system can be enabled on computers that can identify human emotions. There have been many scientists and researchers that are working on this so it can detect your emotions by the muscles in your body. It is kind of like when you are trying to detect a friends emotion because you can tell how they are feeling.\r\n\r\nImagine this a system that can read your emotions based on your facial expressions that is based off of facial muscles. This is something we already kind of do when we try to tell a friends facial expressions. This is something that we humans should be happy to have we hate being bored and a computer would be able to tell that we are, so it would never play that video or ad again which would make it would modify the lesson for each person according to Huang. Also if you really liked that video or ad that was just played they would play simliar ones to it.\r\n\r\nDr. Huang also explains that most communication is non verbal in fact most of our communication is non verbal.\r\n\r\nSo, what is the Facial Action Coding System you might be thinking. Well the facial action coding system is a computer that constructs a 3d model of each persons face. This must take a while since we do have 44 major muscles in our face. This computer is basically supposed to be able to detect at least the 6 main basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The machine can do so by it can tell the characteristic movements of each facial muscle. The article describes like when you raise your eyebrows you show surpise and when the muscles around your lips it shows anger. This can be benificial in a lot of ways especially when it can tell that you don't like something. Also humans might try to guess facial traits, but we can't describe each facial trait someone has.\r\n\r\nSurely you are thinking that a machine can't detect somebodies emotions, but it could detect that the Mona Lisa she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted,6% fearful, and\r\n\r\n2% angry.",

        "In the article ''Driverless Cars Are Coming,'' they talk about how there is a new invention coming. As you can tell by the title of the article, they give some pros and cons about the new invention. Some thing's the author of the article mentions is how the car works and what kind of details will be in it.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things they mentioned was how the car works. It tell's how the car would run on half the fuel we use today. Google has already made a car that is ''driverless' and it has not crashed yet. These cars would run on a track that has an electrical cable that sends radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car.\r\n\r\nFurther on, they also explained some details they might add to the car. One of the details is that the car can handle functions up to twenty-five miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Not all of the cars are completely driverless. In fact, the only main things they can do are steer,accelerate, and brake. All are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. Another detail they have is that the drivers seat vibrates when the vehicle is in dangerof backing into something. One last detail they mention is having cameras watch the driver to make sure that the drivers a remaining focused on the road.\r\n\r\nWith both of those topics being mentioned, I honestly do not think they should make the cars for public use.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. For example the author states ''A classroom computer could recognize when a studeny is becoming confused or bored,''Dr Huang predicts.''Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor''(Making Mona Lisan smile).\r\n\r\nThis new system is also really smart in detecting oneself emotions for example,the author also states that''But in a false smile,the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie;these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ''smiling''politician or celebrity isn't being truthful''(Making Mona lisa Smile).\r\n\r\nThis is important because this new technology system can help a lot with kids education.\r\n\r\nSometimes kids are afraid of asking their teachers for help because they feel embarrased but with this new technology system it will actually make students feel not afraid or embarrased.\r\n\r\nStudents are actually going to get help without having to ask a teacher because the Facial Action Coding System will be able to recognize if a student is confused or bored and then it's going to come in with help.\r\n\r\nAlso this new system can help teachers know how students are feeling towards a subject and how they are doing on a certain subject. The new system will make it easier for teachers and will also save them a huge time rather than asking or doing tests to show results on how well they know the lesson.",
        "Can you picture a life without human in control of driving? Yes, it might sound like a good idea but its more realistic then you think. In the article Driverless Cars Are Coming it states \" Telsa has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of dring on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes- Benz, Audi and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020\". Humans have always been driving cars since say cars have been invented. The idea of drivless car is new since humans have always been in control manually. Driverless cars is a idea that is inot logical. There no point in making driverless cars for people to use.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to a car there are so many parts that could go wrong. Imagine what could go on with a car that is driverless. A driverless car would have more technology parts then a normal car does. If a part goes damage you don't know what the damage could be. This idea is new and so many people will not be able to fix a part on their driverless car. Technology is still a very new idea and their people who don't know how to use it.\r\n\r\nWho really need a driverless\r\n\r\ncar in life. This idea will just increase the laziness people will have. People would depend on this car and forget how to drive a car. Life today is just fiding new ideas to make humans life easier. This car will increase the laziness in humans and make their life harder then they think. In the article is say\" Why would would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?\". This idea takes out the fun in driving a car and makes it extremely boring.\r\n\r\nThis would affect finacially people. Not everyone would be able to afford a car that is driverless. Some people can barely afford a 2002 car let alone a new driverless car.",

        "I beleive that the use of the 'Facial Action Coding System' to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is valuable and nearly detremental to a student that's learning online. In a classrom with an instructure leacturing, if the student becomes confused, he or she can raise their hand and ask a question. A teacher may even notice when a student is confused by the facial expression they make. Though, learning online is an independent task and most of the time, you don't have anyone to truly explain and fill you in on what you're just simply not grasping on to.\r\n\r\nUsing this new form of technology can be helpful to not only the student, but the website or app they are learning from. For example, if a student is reading an article, the website owner or app designer will know if most students find the article interesting or are able to see if the article provided is truly at grade level. The Facial Action Coding System could also be used in grade school type settings. There are plenty of websites now for the education of children, like ABCmouse.com. The program can possibly give the feedback of the child's emotions and sense of awareness to their parents while using the program. With that, it proves my point that the use of this technology is beneficial to all ages.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in paragraph 5, the author stated \"In fact we humans perform this same impressive \"calculation\" every day.\" then later gave an example of the ability that we have to tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look or her face. As human beings, this most likely began as an instict in order to tell how one another may react, attack, ect. Although now, we are much more than that. Some are striving to be heart surgeons or rocket scientists. We need to have the technology to explain the question in a different way if the student doesn't understand.\r\n\r\nA kid may get a bad grade on something simply because of the way the question was stated. That kid could be a genious but just learns in a differnet way.",
        "I have mixed feelings about driverless cars for many reasons even though it does have its positive effects. Can these cars be the next step of evolution in the manufacturing industry or can it be hazardous?\r\n\r\nDriverless cars do seem like a futuristic idea that does sound very amazing and can possibly happen, lets talk about some of the positves of these cars. Driverless cars are very efficient in the fact of not wasting fuels and or saving fuel as stated in paragraph one. Driverless cars will always be very aware of its own surroundings, they are equiped with sensors to stop the car, alert the drivers, or shall I say \"Passangers\" of any danger, etc. Google has had these cars go around the country and they have gone more than half a million miles without a single crash, in my own opinion, a car with a driver would have most likely crashed within those miles. Although these cars have their positives, they are also negative because they are not completely \"driverless\".\r\n\r\nThese cars are not independent for the most part. They require a driver to be in the car, but stay nuetral until the car needs help moving around an obstacle, for example a traffic jam or car crash. I do not like the fact that this is not a fully independant car, the passanger of the car is supposed to be fully aware of the vehicle and its surroundings while it is moving, but lets be honest, being in a car and not having to drive for once will make the passanger not pay attention to their surroundings, they can fall asleep and or be on their phones, etc, that is a problem. What if the car has an engineering problem and nearly drives off the road or causes an accident, is it the drivers fault or the cars fault?",
        "The future is coming at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are not just ideas anymore.\r\n\r\nThey are being manufactured and tested at this very moment.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars can be seen as both good and bad, but I do not think they are good for society just yet.\r\n\r\nFor cars to be driverless, they would have to be able to respond quickly to anything, at anytime.\r\n\r\nThey would also need to possess a faster reaction time than humans.\r\n\r\nIf all of these features were put into a car, then it is no longer a car; it is a robotic machine, capable of making decisions that could mean life or death of the passengers and nearby pedestrians.\r\n\r\nHowever, as of now, cars are still not entirely driverless.\r\n\r\nWe do not yet have the technology to manufacture cars that have the human qualities that are necessary in driving, such as natural reflexes to avoid obstacles blocking the path.\r\n\r\nThe world we live in today is not the same world we lived in yesterday, or the world we will live in tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe technology we currenetly have is progressing at an alarming speed.\r\n\r\nToday it's smart cars, tomorrow it's smart houses, and the next day it's smart people.\r\n\r\nTechnology is a good thing, but humans are so fixated on making everything bigger and better that they forget how good it is now.\r\n\r\nWhat will come of the human population if we solely rely on techonolgy and not each other?\r\n\r\nIf driverless cars become the sole transportation for short distances over land, then humans will not find a need to work on their hand- eye coordination and reflexes.\r\n\r\nIf that were to happen, then people will start to lose those motor functions.\r\n\r\nWith the speedy progression of technology, humans are slowly beginning to devolve.\r\n\r\nWith the production of smart phones and other tablets, humans have shorter attention spans than their ancestors.",
        "I think that if we ever did find aliens on Mars or even a civilazation we should stay away from it. The reason why is because if we ever did find a other planet we never really be called the only planet in the universe. In the article we found out that we have a new way to find people. We never really thought that their was ever a civilazation on Mars.\r\n\r\nAs we found out that we may have found a way to a other civilazation. I just recently told you that we should never go near Mars. The reason why I told you that is because we don't now their lifes, their ways, or even if they were freindly. When NASA told us that we have a way to find people we should never talk to them. Yes it does show that we had images of planet Mars or even that their might have been a culture.",
        "Think about the time you felt extremely tired. That time where you could barely keep your eyes open, everything you heard was a blob, because you were simply zoned out. You were feeling tired. For me this time would be sitting in my english class learning about Shakespeare. I felt as if the time were never ending in that class. Students all around me had the same facial expression on them. Facial expressions are a huge key of communication. When you are out in public you see many faces around, and you can easily assume their emotions and what they are feeling. With technology being a huge factor in tody's society, we can now use it to determine someone's emotion. I believe that using technology to read emotional expressions on students could really bring forth value in classrooms.\r\n\r\nStudents all over the school have different things going on. They show and deplict off different emotions at an instant. Sometimes these emotions make it hard for students to concentrate in class during instructions or new lessons given by the teachers. Referring back to the article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", Nick D'Alto, the writer, writes about a new software called the Facial Action Coding System. The new sytem was developed to determine the accuracy of emotions of people around us. If this software were to be implemented in our school, then this could be an advantage in shaping a better society. The software will help teachers determine the emotions students are feeling at the time of lecture. D'Alto quotes Dr. Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicting that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". Once recognizing the emotions of the student, Dr. Huang continues predicting that the software can \"Then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"",
        "They have many things that show that the landform is natrual. One reason that the landform could be real is by pointing out that back then the cameras were not as good with quality so the camera could make it look like that. Another reason could also br the weather in that time the weather could have a big part in the way it looks.\r\n\r\nThe angel of the camera could also make a big diffrence in the look of it. the angel of the light that was ln it also could mae the changed because it was the shadow that made the landform look like a human head. Back then the pixels of the photo were 43 meters compared to now which is 1.56 meters. The clouds could also change the look.\r\n\r\nMany things could of changed it those are many reasons why it is real but people think diffrent ly and also have diffrent things formed in there head.",
        "Reading someones facial expression may be effective sometimes but that does not mean that they are actually feeling a certain emotion like anger and confusion for example, but they could be feeling extremely happy. In the article, the author stated that Dr. Huang used a picture of Mona Lisa to test the new emotion-recognition software but the software may not be effective because they tested it on a painted photo and not a real living person. Also, da Vinci could have exagerrated Mona Lisas facial expression for the sake of the painting so they may not be accurate.\r\n\r\nUsing this software in a classroom may not be effective because if a student is making a certain face that does not mean that they are bored or confused, it could just be how their face naturally looks. The software can also mis read their face and even glitch. The use of this program would require the use of a camera through the computer and that is not always safe. Hackers could be trying to hack their computer and steal personal information from the person or even their identity.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this software is not valuable for classroom use because students have other things that they need other then a facial coding system. If the student knows that the camera is active then that could even become a distraction to them so they use of this software is not needed.",

To what the passage tells I think the Face was created by something other than an alien.

Throughout the years of the world, many landforms be been formed due to the weather and nothing else. The text tells of how scientists flew over to where the Face is located and clearly stated that this Face was a natural landform and that there was no monument made be aliens after all.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have read and heard about mars, there is no such thing as life on that planet. Many may argue that there is such thing as aliens on mars and that they did create or form this landform. The text states that due to the time of season, skeptics may believe that alien markings were hidden by the haze. Little do they realize that with the technology the scientists could make the photo bigger to see closer in to what the face looked like up close and the markings or anything that surround the area of the Face.\r\n\r\nIn the last paragraph of the passage, the text states that this picture show the equivalence to a butte or mesa.\r\n\r\nAlso according to the text that there are landforms common to this one in the American West.",

        "Luke is a boy signing up with his friend Don,here's some reason's why you should also sign up like Luke did himself. My first reason is you can help people while you travel like how Luke did when he went to europe to help people restock on supplies,food,and animals. You can also go because,while you're shipping animals across seas you can spend time with somepretty amazing animals. Another good one is you can go sightseeing while shipping or going on the land you shipped something to like how Luke did when he went to Europe. These are all great in my point of view because even its some hard work it can still be enjoyable because there is just so much to see like how I mentioned the animals before,and of course the sightslike ruins,structures,and much more. Another point of fun you could have while being a seagoing cowboy is after you shp the animals off of the boat or ship when the animals are gone it can clear up some room for you and any friends you may or may not have made. What I mean is after the animals are gone you can use the extra room for games,messing around,and even spending time with friends you may have made. THis is a good idea because even thogh its hard work and a little bit dangerous Luke stayed positive because of him stating \"The cattle boat trps were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy\" meaning he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy. Now even though its still fun to be a seagoing cowboy there is still dangers. The ocean is a pretty dangerous place so it'll still be a hard job especially when it comes to storms. If a serious storm hits while on a boat trip it could still be pretty devastating someone could get knocked off and go into the ocean,one of the animals could fall off,and someone cold slide and break something when they have a hard fall.",
        "It's Not An Alien\r\n\r\nIn my opinion I don't think this is a face created by aliens becuase there are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. Maybe scientists have found unusaul things and claim aliens have created them but there is no proof that aliens are real.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think it is not a face is because in \"Unmasking the ace of Mars\" it said,\"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this onbe had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egytian Pharoah.

        "The role of driverless cars have become bigger and more accessable to the public and companies. There are pros and cons to these new developments but ultimately I believe they are for the best.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are downsides to having driverless cars at the moment, such as not being comletely automatic, that will probably change in the future. The problem now is that the cars only automate themselves in certain situations so the driver has to be alert and ready to take over the wheel. So what's the\r\n\r\npoint of having a driverless car where you have to be alert at every moment? That is only a problem of the present. If more time and research is put into this project than eventually we will get cars that can drive automaticaly on the road full time without the need of being alert at all times. Human drivers make mistakes and that can cause harm to themselves and to others. Without the variable to human mistake, and if we could perfect the driverless car, there would be virtually no car crashes or car related injuries. Driverless cars have sensors and that let them take the right course of action or brake at the right time which could otherwise lead to accidents.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are getting smarter.",

        "I do not agree with the whole driverless car thing. To start off it is dangerous. The idea that the person has to always be alert defeats the purpose of it being driverless. Also the alerts to get the drivers attention should not be needed. I mean if someone creates a driverless car they should actually make it so it is, in fact, driverless.\r\n\r\nOn long road trips I get that one person has to drive the whole time, and yes the driver could get tired and want to take a nap. This would be good for them but even if the driver were to go to sleep and be awaken to an accident in front of them. You cannot expect a human that has been sleeping to be completely in control of what is going on at the time. Who knows, they might freak out and run into something else. There are so many possibilities that something could go horribly wrong with driverless car.\r\n\r\nYes, I know almost everyone expects to have all this new technology in the future.

In paragraph 7, the text clearly states, \" There was no alien monument after all.\"\r\n\r\nThis means that aliens could not have created the Face as a signification or monument to proof thier existance.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Face is a landform.

        "The way that a detective can identify lying, or truthfulness is impressive to people, while decoding emotions is definitely a little more complicated. Even if it may seem like its easy to tell how someone's feeling, and you can see your friend is simply upset, or excited, like the article said, explaining them and reading more complicated emotions, most likely isnt as easy. Technology to read our emotions is definitely a sign that software is getting more advanced, but not neccecarily more helpful. This software of course can be benfited from in ways of entertainment and efficiencey in technology, but in classrooms, I think that it's a different debate. And my thoughts of this in classrooms are that it's pretty much the opposite of helpful.\r\n\r\nIn this article, the example they use to show how it could be efficient in schools is '\"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" and then goes on to say how the software could change the lesson for them, or give some help. What would an average student (saying this software isnt yet in classrooms) do\r\n\r\nin the same situation? Raise their hand, ask for help from a teacher, and get personal help just the same way the technology would solve the problem. To be fair though, not all students have an available teacher, or some work at home, what could those students do? Contact someone else (like a teacher for example in online school), figure it out, and eventually understand the problem all the same. With this technology of course, the idea is that the student doesnt have to put in any effort of asking for help, and could identify the eventual solution by just showing emotion. Worded differently, this entire example of how classroom\r\n\r\ncomputers are beneficial, could become a statement of flaws in this idea.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the software could most likely be easily tricked, and for the evidence of students easily being able to get help & manipulate the lesson by emotions, the student could also manipulate the lesson purposefully, using the softwares features to easily get ahead in problems, or simply not put much effort into understanding it. For the point of ease becuse of the software with students who are simply confused is a good point, but what about the lessons that communicating teaches them? The future of their life isnt going to be only technology-based, and what happens when people rely too much on the ease of simply getting their emotions read, and start to not as easily communicate with actual people.

We should believe Scientist at NASA,because they have facts and pictures that look like faces made of landforms. Scientist claim they know the facts of what looks like a landform and they think this is a posibility that this is one of them. Also, We should believe its landforms because nobody has ever seen aliens before they just think that they look like on what they have on social media etc. Even if they look like what we have in pictures that still would NOT be an aliens face!! If you look at the picture it might actually look like a formed face but its not .We should also believe NASA because .. they are scientificly trained to look at these and study things to see and know what they are .. Why would you really believe and think you know whats on the internet instead of believing things that you see! Use research!\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,I think the face is a landform because if so , aliens do not look like humans and the faces on mars looks like a human face and i think we should stop assuming and go with the facts from NASA.",
        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author has a very optimisstic look on the chances of touching ground and exploring Venus someday. The author includes the risk that humans would be taking by touching ground on Venus and why humans can not withstand the conditions of the surface of the planet. But, the author counteracts the risks with new ideas of technology that we can use and some alternative ways to get closer to Venus. The article is told in a professional type way by stating the pros and cons of why we haven't been on Venus yet. But, the article also gives evidence of why humans shouldn't let the cons hold humans back from someday making it to Venus's surface safely.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 2, the author begins by creating the illusion that Venus is quite simply, \"...right around the corner...\". He also states that \"...Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too.\" These two statements alone start the paragraph off with the sense that Venus is a \"simple\" planet we could explore and that is easier to access distance wise. The author then goes on to tell us in paragraph 3 the dangers of Venus and the reason why humans haven't explored this \"simple\" plant yet. He then transitions back into an optimisstic tone by curiously explaining the past on Venus and comparing Venus to our home planet of Earth. For example, in paragraph 4, he states that \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\"",

These cars can also \"steer, accelerate, and brake themselves,\" but still are designed to tell the driver when they are needed to do tasks only the drivers can do. The information coming from the sensors can cause the car to apply \"brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control,\" than a driver can manage alone.

        "Can Cars really be driverless? This article gives us information on the science beneath the production of the driverless car. The car has some ups and downs to it, however, the technology is becoming more and more advanced and understood as we go throughout the years.\r\n\r\nThe driverless car has some great advantages to it. In the 1950s General Motors created what they call a concept car that only ran on a special test track. The track had embedded eletrical cable which sent radio signals to the car. The technology put into a car has a dubbed LIDAR, which uses and constantly updates a 3-D mode of the cars surroundings. The combination allows the driverless car to be able to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. The car manufacturers are considering putting cameras in the car to watch and make sure the drivers are still aware of what is going on on the road.\r\n\r\nHowever there are still some downfalls to the driverless cars. Although they have figured out how to make it to where the car can drive on the freeway hands free and be able to park hands free, you are never really not driving the car. A comon question asked is \"Wouldn't the driver get board wating for their turn to drive?\" Well you have to be in full alert even if you are just sitting in the car. They have created technlology to where the person sitting in the car will get alerts when they need to take over. Say the car is on the freeway and it comes to a work zone. The car will send an alert telling the driver to take over.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are on a great road to becoming something great.",
        "I'm against these cars 100 percent just for the simple fact that computers are trying to take over this world. They take jobs from people everday and it really sad, and now they are trying to take driving away from us, like one thing where we can still actually control.\r\n\r\nThat is really funny in my opinion, if it madders? Well, anyways I feel that this is not the way to get around it will eventually have wrecks which will have bad rep if they start wrecking a lot, and they will if you get enough on the road. What I do not like is that you have to stay alert while driving it I could see if you could sleep on the way while it drives. This is crazy you have to stay alert to drive a driverless car why not just drive a real car youself what do you not stay alert driveing a real car? I know I am a good alert defensive drive like everyone should this driverless car idea just comes down to being lazy honestly. On to the gas well this might use half as a real car, but if the goverment was not so messed up then maybe we'd get paid decent money and gas could be a fair price that way we can find a happy medium for everyone. you just need to stay safe do not use your phone in the car if you have to pull over to see where you are going or to make a call/text. Just get a map they still have those you know that would be better to pull over and use in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this new \"car\" is dangerous I think it should not make it on the road we do not need it just drive why are we so lazy. If you cannot be an alert driver in a real car what makes you think you will be in this car.",
        "The author in this story has a totally different persepective on studying Venus than most people probably would. He tries not to focus on the negatives since we all know that it's humanly impossible to step foot on Venus. He feels that hummanity shouldn't just give up on the mission forvever becasue it's dangerous and we have doubts on the mission. He looks at it as motivation and a challenge, rather than impossible. You never know what we could discover there so it's always good to have a strong imagination even if people think you're crazy, because those people change the world.\r\n\r\nNASA is still looking into this research. They understand that they can't send humans to the planet, but they have a plan to send scientists in space to float above Venus and do their research from up there. Obviously their information wouldn't be as valid from being up above the planet rather than being on the planet, but it's the closest they can get to this day. In the future they hope to be able to create technology and machinery that is strong enough to withstand the preasure and heat from the burning planet. Resaerchers believe that long ago Venus was a lot like Earth, and was covered with a lot of similar features like valleys, mountains, and craters.

Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. In \"The Challange of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursit despite the danger it presents. Three reasons that supports author idea is Venus has dangerous geology and weather , the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, and the surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe fisrt reason is Venus present dangerous geology and weather. In Venus, the climate and weather are worst and danger which make nothing to survive. in a paragraph, it said \" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting vocanoes, powerful earthquake, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface.\" This show why it's danger for anything that land on Venus.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is venus has the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. In a paragraph, it said \" The cloud conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth; scuh as enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\" this show how it is dangerous to humans and enviroments.\r\n\r\nThe third reason is the surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fehrenheit. Also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our planet.",
        "When someone hears the words \"driverless cars\", they get excited at the thought of something so futuristic at one time that it seems like something out of a science fiction novel. However, now that dream is becoming a reality. Large companies such as Google or BMW are advancing in this highly experimental field, and Google has been since as early as 2009. But is letting the machine take over most of the time really the best option? Could it lead to even more problems than it hopes to fix? These questions have yet to be answered and need to be.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, BMW began developing a project they dubbed the \"Traffic Jam Assistant\", allowing a car to handle all possible functions up to the speed of 25 mph. But even though the car drove itself, the driver still had to remain alert and keep both hands on the wheel where sensors were located. And in such situations as work zones or accidents, the driver had to take over. Moments like these should always be handled by the driver, because the only thing a vehicle needs is one single driver. If a pedestrian ever makes the mistake of crossing too late on a crosswalk in the middle of the street, the car is not going to be ablle to know if it is coming or not or whether the car can steer clear of causing an accident because of human error.\r\n\r\nThere is also the consideration of laws. In our current era, whoever hits someone initially in a traffic collision, is the one to blame, and the one who helps pay off the other driver's bill. Human error is a natural thing, and we all make mistakes, but if there is ever an accident in which an autonomous car is made and is involved in an accident, who is responsible in the end? Is it the driver, or is it the car which is supposed to be incapable of making mistakes? Allowing a car to be responsible for one person's life is not the best decision, and should be thought out more accordingly, than just seeing it as a fun toy because our laziness is growing so much, that we can't even drive for ourselves.\r\n\r\nThen there is the cost, both on our wealth and our experience. If we allow cars to drive us around and take us anywhere we like, what will happen when it's our turn to drive. We will be less alert, paying attention to our surroundings instead of focusing on the road. Some may argue that cars come with warning signals that the driver must take control soon, but will they have enough time to completely survey the area and assess the situation?",

All the new idea flooding out of our minds dayley are deffinatly changing our tomorrow, but one in particular that could change us forever are driverless cars.\r\n\r\nScientist are slowly creating cars that will no longer need a driver. They are creating sensors all around the car that detect anything comming twoards them. They have yet to perfect these cars because they can't get the computer to understand the skills of driving in traffic, or anything unusual about the road like road blocks. Also many states will not agree to even let them test these vehicles there because the law states \"the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.\" (P9 L4/5)\r\n\r\nPersonally I do not think this creation is one of our better ideas. I do not like this idea because I love driving. I love being able to take control of my car and make it go as fast or slow as I want. Driving is a great responsiblity to have. I just don't see how letting a machine do everything for us is fun. Also these driverless cars are \"something that was simply too expensive to be practical\" (P3 L11/12) All the money put into these cars would make them nearly impossible to buy to about anyone who is not rich.\r\n\r\nMany other people will deffinatly disagree with me, and they might say that this will be a much safer alternative. Yes, it could be much safer because we would not have to worry about texting and driving, drunk driving, or any type of reckless driving.

The author of \"The Challenge of Exporing Venus\" explains by listing the reasons why we should, listing the challenges, and saying possible solutions to those challenges.\r\n\r\nSo, why should we explore one of the solar systems most hostile planet? Well, the author explains that, at times, Venus is the closest planet to Earth. It is considered to be Earth's twin, because both planets have similar density and size. It also could have been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. It has similar features geography such as valleys, mountains, and craters; scientists believe that, long ago, Venus was covered in huge oceans and could possibly support life.\r\n\r\nThis planet, that used to support life, is now hostile. The author tells the reader that the atmosphere of Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide, has sulfiric acid, and has an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's.

        "Our facial expressions can tell someone a lot about how we feel about something or situations in our lives, sometimes even better than verbal communication. Being able to read these expressions and change the environment around us could help the human race acheive the goal of becoming monumentally more happy people. Throughout the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author mentions many studies and facts relating to the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions. This would be very useful in the classroom because the studies shown have very intelligent figures present, the article includes a thourough explanation about how the FACS operates and succeeds, and how the technology could improve the willingness to learn and the ultimate goal of maintaining happiness.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in paragraph 6, the diction in the paragraph and the implementation of an interview with an intelligent figure relating to the product prove that this machine could make a vital difference in a classroom-style learning environment. For exmaple, author Nick D'Alto interviews Dr. and Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang works with other professors such as Nicu Sebe on the FACS, and in this pragraph he states many important facts about how computers could alter the learning environment based on how the student feels. Dr. Huang says, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"\r\n\r\nBeing able to modify a lesson for a single student rather than an entire group could make a huge difference. Rather than the teacher having to chage the whole lesson for the entire class, the computer could \"read\" and individual student's face and effectively personalize the lesson for that student alone. This technology could supply a much needed change to the sometimes ineffective teaching of an instructor.\r\n\r\nAlso, in paragraphs 7 and 8, detailed instructions are given on how the machine works and how it can detect fake emotions from real emotions. For example, at the end of paragraph 7, the author states the difference between the muscle movements in a real and fake smile. He then states how the machine looks for the muscle movements and formations of a real smile rather than those of a fake one. Also, in paragraph 8, even more examples of differences in muscle formation are used to show how the technology will in fact work in a classroom environment.",
        "Students go to school everyday,and throughtout\r\n\r\ntheir day their mood and emotions can change. Ever wondered what their emotions was? No need to worry anymore there is a new technology that has just came upon us. Its called a Facial Action Coding System which allows computers to identify human emotions. Which is a stupid tool to be used in a classroom.\r\n\r\nThe FACS or readers reading this know it the Facial Action Coding System in my opinion is a not a tool that should be used in classroom for many reasons why. One of those reasons is that students go through various amounts of emotions in a day. One minute they can be happy then the next minute they can be upset. I feel as if it would be too time consuming for teachers to stop class and run a students face through a computer program to get how they are feeling. That would take away learning time not just for the child that is getting his face scan but the other kids in the classroom who would have to wait while the teacher runs the childs face.In paragraph three we can see that the process might take some time to do when the author says,\" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscless this in the model must move like human muscles.\" This shows that before you can even run the test the computer must be a model of your face which will add on to time.\r\n\r\nAlso another reason that the Facial Action Coding System shouldn't be used in classrooms is because its not gonna change the emotion of the kid. The teachers spends all of that time scanning a student face to get his emotion for no reason at all.",
        "The \"Evening Star\" as the author from \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" is another name for venus.

The author debates that the value of going to venus is worthy despite the dangers and obsticles we face.\r\n\r\nA point that the author provides is that Earth is similar to Venus and that we should conduct further studies on the planet. A point that the author makes quite often to show that we can learn about our planet based off learning from Venus, \"Today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters\" (Exploring Venus). from this peice of evidence it is clear that the author is trying to establish a link between earth and venus, That venus is very similar to us so it is worth exploring. Another example of the author connecting earth and Venus is when the author writes about what could of been on Venus \"Long ago, Venus was Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth\" (Exploring Venus). The wrtitter of this story specifically said \"just like Earth\" because his goal is to establish the scientific evidence that could be gained from going to Venus because it is similar to Earth.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the another reason that NASA should send a manned mission to Venus is that it may be the only chance at a expodition to another planet. The author provides information on how close Venus is and how this can be crucial \"occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimnes we are closer to mars and other times Venus\" (Exploring Venus).

Driverless car would make a huge change in our world today. There would be alot less bad things happening if they were driverless. People wouldnt have to go through the trouble to push the gas to make the care go or anything.\r\n\r\nThe postitive effects of turing to driveless cars are very high. People want this to happen so they are going to try to find all the positive thing about it and let other people know. The cars that Sergey Brin are creating would use half of the fuek that todays taxes and offer more flexibility than a bus. The cars have been driven more than half a million miles without crashing but the thing about that is that google care arent truly driverless. The cars still alret the driver when they are pullin gin and out of driveways or dealing with traffic suchas getting aroung roadwork and accidents.\r\n\r\nThe good thing right now is the cars are not completely driveless becuase you can steer, accelerate, and brake themseleves, but they are still designed to tell the driver that the road ahead requires them to something like get through work zones and around accidents.\r\n\r\nThere are many negitive thing to having driveless cars as well such as making sure that the automatic will happen at all times.

        "Driverless cars are definitly an advancement in society today. Although there are slightly independent cars today, it is projected that by 2020 Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan plan to have self driven automotives. In the article, \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" a decent amount of benifits were listed. One of those benifits are safety features, such as the inability to use a telocommunication device while in the vehicle.\r\n\r\nEach of the self driven automotives will have regulations. While the car is in the self driving mode the opperator must be alert. By doing this the driver must have both hands on the steering wheel. The steering wheels have a sensor built in; made to ensure that when road conditions ahead need human capabilities they can take over quickly and safely. Another restriction included in the driverless cars are the ability to shut off all systems instantly. For example in-car entertainment is a privlage but may be turned off when neccessary.\r\n\r\nThese self driven cars include many other features as well. GPS, Tire, motion, and radar sensors are installed in these vehicles. When in reverse newer cars have the ability to have a camera in there dash to see the surroundings behind them. Vibrating seats are a feature used to alert the driver when they are close to hitting an object around them. With these advancements in the self driving automotives the opporation system can be a copy cat of a human driver.\r\n\r\nNot only do the driverless cars have safety features but save on gas.",

If the driverless cars are responsive to crashes and quick breaking like they say the cars will be, then yeah i think the driverless cars are a great idea.\r\n\r\nThe movie industry has been showing us these kind of things such as driverless cars for decades. In the movies you will see flying cars or even driverless cars, so to see Google cofounder Sergey Brin taking a pledge and trying to create such a thing is really incredible. If manufactured right and having the right electronics and gadgets on it, these driverless cars could take over the future when it come to driving or selecting a car.\r\n\r\nBack in the 1950's, General Motors created a car that could run on a test track but with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the vehicle. Engineers at Barkley done something like that but with magnets that will \"self\" drive the car around the track. The only problem with that is the amount of money it would costs to supply the roads with these magnets they are wanting to put in the roads to control these cars. Also having these sensors and so much technology in the car it would not take much for something to go wrong, have the sensors in the car fail and you lose the front end of your car and causes a tramatic accident. So it is just little things that like that can put such a big downfall on a project like this.\r\n\r\nParagraph 9 talks about the laws that are directed to the regular gas, electrical and diesel vehicles, but what about the new driverless cars, won't you need new laws? Of course we will, that is one of the biggest things made in this case about the new cars, because new laws will need to be made in order to cover liability in the case of an accident.",
        "May 24, 2001 was the date it all started. When the \"Face on Mars\" conspiracy began. NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling a region of Mars called Cydonia. The Viking 1 was taking snapshots of the Cydonia when it spoted a shadowy figure close of a human face. This snapshot was sent to the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2. After careful review at the mission controllers at the Jet Propulision Lab they found out that it wasn't a human face. It turned out to be Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Although this one had an unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of the finding of the \"Face\" NASA unveiled the image for all the public to see. They added a capition to the image that quoted \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" The authors used the photo as a propaganda to get the publics attention to Mars, and it rsulted on good high notes. The \"Face of Mars\" became an pop icon from starring in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkut lines for 25years! Then to clear up that the \"Face\" didn't show signs of life Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped the same image ten times sharper and it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien momument after all. They tried another picture after people wouldn't believe the landform idea and the Martian came equivalent of a butte or mesa. Jim Garvin said it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the image of the \"Face On Mars\" sparked contrivsory in if it was a face or a natural landfrom.",
        "Many scientists and astronomers might ask \" Is exploring Venus worth the risk? This might be a question that is asked all around the world. Some people may find visiting Venus is too dangerous. Others really don't mind the challenge. The real question is, is NASA really going to conduct this unnecessary experiment?\r\n\r\nThe author seems like he or she is for exploring Venus. In paragraph 4, the author gives exceptional reasons on why Venus is a worthy pursuit. Also, the narrator seems like he or she is for sending humans to explore Venus. Throughout the whole article, the author is in favor of this idea. Well, an old friend of mine always said everything is not what it seems.\r\n\r\nThe author's idea of visiting Venus is valued but too risky. Paragraph 4 states \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.\" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because its most Earth like planet in the solar system. In paragraph 5, the article says \" NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.\" Additionally, all of this evidence supports my claim.",
        "The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He supports this idea by sharing that Venus once has been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. It expands human knowledge about the planet and enhances technology to be more capable of traveling to Venus.\r\n\r\nLong ago, Venus may have been an Earth-like planet. The planet brings danger but this won't stop scientist from disccusing how it may have been a sister planet to Earth. In the text it states \" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.\" This indicates that there were very common features about Venus long ago and even now that can relate to earth. The scientist are fascinated by these findings and are willing venture off to Venus and find out more.\r\n\r\nGoing to Venus is a tough job and can be quite dangerous. So technology is going to need to be upgraded to be able to fit Venus' harsh temperatures and atmosphere. Enhancing technology is whats going to keep people learning and wanting to improve. With these improvements travel to harsher planet will be easier. The text states \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out the way.\"",
        "The use of driveless cars can be defined as a statement of stupidity in your world today. They are not the way to the future as what this article say it is. All people need to have complete contorl of the wheel at all times. We learned that at a very young age and it needs to stick with us.\r\n\r\nMy position on this blanketed idea is that we in America should not have this type of car. There are many reasons for this ordeal. In the use of a drivelss car, many people would think to not even have to worry about driving the car since it can do it by themselves. So what happens if the car malfuncitons and the driver is asleep, then what happens, a crash, a death. That is a one reason on why we should not have these cars.\r\n\r\nAnother reason would be, the income and cost on these cars. The article doesn't state this material, but in order to make these cars so that they are drivelss, it would cost a lot more money than making an ordinary car. And the manufature has to sell it, so people are going to spend a lot more money than they have to on a car that they can drive by themselves. The money is not worth the risk.\r\n\r\nAlso google has stated that the car is not in complete control, a driver in needed. So, by this statement if a driver is needed then why do we need drivless cars if a driver is needed. Do we need them so people can text and call when they please, we have bluetooth cars for those situations. Also GM has pointed that, that in order for a car to be in complete control of the wheel, it needs roads that can read it's binary code.",

Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers.''",

This Facial Action Coding System could be incredibly valuable by reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.\r\n\r\nIn the article D'Alto states, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson..\" With this technology students may be able to understand lessons more quickly and easily. This coding system could also help more troubling students excel in the classroom while saving the teachers time. By modifying the lesson, the Facial Coding System would also keep the attention of learners. This could train students to become exception learners as they grow.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph eight of \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author describes how the muscles in the face change according to your mood.",
        "Wow! Did you know that Venus have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system? It was the second planet from our sun. Venus is very similar to earth. it was often called earth's rwin. It was one of the brighest points of light in the night sky. Scienctist tried to study Venus but they could not because they don't have devices that can stay longer than a week on Venus. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.\r\n\r\nNext, Venus is very similar to Earth. The Venus was often called Earth's twin because if you look at the Venus the color was blue and they believed taht Venus was probably covered largely with oceans. Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size and the distance are closest too. Just like in earth the Venus has a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. It was our nearest option for a planetary visit. It was one of their challenge to get to Venus and study about it. \"The Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\r\n\r\nSecond, photography and videography, and researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, Scienctist tried to study the Venus but they couldn't because they don't have any techonology that can be sent to Venus. Sometime they thought that sending people to Venus but since it was dangerous. They made electronics made of silicon carbide and they tested it. At first, it was work but it only last for onw week. Now, they are looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. This devices doesn't electronics it was faster, faster, and flexible.

        "Venus, a very powerful, interesting, planet that needs to be explored more indepth to ease our minds, to let the curiosity subdue. Venus is absolutely a planet that deserves a our attention. Why does it deserve our attention though; is it worth our time and money? If it was not worth all these risks, why would it be a topic of matter?\r\n\r\nIn the passage it states,\" Venus, sometimes called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.\" Many wondering minds think about all the possibilities of what could be on Venus and if it could be similar to Earth. Venus is our neighbor, or as paragraph 2 states,\" Earth's twin.\" \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\" If you had a brother or sister that close to you yet so far away wouldn't you want to find out about them?\r\n\r\nVenus should be worth the exploration because there are so many possibilies of what could be on Venus. The passage states,\" Venus still has some features that are analogous to those close to Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sedient and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" As crazy as it sounds, there is a chance that the sediments from Venus, and other objects like rocks, are here on Earth too. I believe that we have scientists already working on the break down of what is in these objects and how they got here.\r\n\r\nNASA workers have come up with the idea to send a hovering ship into orbit above Venus. Though the conditions are hard to work with, NASA has the capability to think of a way to let us receive information, pictures, and other objects from Venus. Towards the end of paragraph 5 it says, \" Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\"\r\n\r\nNASA should first send a demo rover out to Venus,before you send our people out. We have already discovered the conditions, like the air, and surface, of Venus.",
        "Have you ever been so confused when it comes to reading and understanding a person that you just ultimately cannot? A new technology system has been released to give exact percentages of a persons emotions just by looking into a camera. The Facial Action Coding System was designed to decode by using \"some new computer software that can recognize human emotions\" (1). The test subject, the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da VInci, has answered many questions when it comes to what she is expressing. The FACS can be valuable in classrooms because it can help with the studies of human anatomy or psychology, and it can help others understand each other.\r\n\r\nCalculating another persons emotions can help with understanding human anatomy and psychology classes at schools. For this software, human anatomy has a major role and \"stores similar anatomical informtaion as electronic code\" (5). The research going along with this system shows there are \"action units\" within facial structure that signifies the movement of one or more muscles. Each of the six basic emotions that Dr. Paul Eckman has classified are all associated with the facial muscles. It is important for students to know these muscles and learn how they work. According to Eckman, \"your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises eyebrows when you're surprised\" and the \"orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger\" (3). This up-to-speed technology comes up with information that no human could, but helps students become knowledgable of how it works. Society is based on technology as of right now, and is the forefront of the younger generations, so this software should partake in a students learning.\r\n\r\nEmotions are something that are unbelievably hard to understand when coming from other people. One typically cannot tell how a person is feeling just by the way they are looking, unless they are close with them personally. Being able to understand someone's emotions will benefit them and their surroundings, as they can get help if they are down or can have reassurance if they think someone is mad at them.",
        "Do you belive in the supernatural or in acient civilizations, like aliens? Well I don't. In the passage \"Unmasking the Face of Mars\" there are two major opinoins on if there once was a civilization on Mars or if it was a natural landform. Based on text and factual evidence I belive that the \"face\" on Mars is a natural land form.\r\n\r\nFirst, \"on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.\" (10) \"Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoulotion.\" (10) Which Means they got the best picure they could.\r\n\r\nIn addition, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digitial image 3 times bigger than you the pixel size. (11) \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see what they were!\" (11) This proves that if it was a civilization, then it would have other structure too, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\nMy last peice of evidence comes from (paragraph 12), \"The picture acutally shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa0landforms common around the American West.\" \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Gavin.\" \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" (12)\r\n\r\nFinally, to oppose my argument the article also stated that, \"The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.

        "Driverless cars are coming and are closer than we think. Driverless cars are a phenomenal idea becauase they're innovative,all major car compaines are moving toward the driverless way and they're safe. This essay will disscuss these three reasons on why driverless cars are a phenomenal idea.\r\n\r\nFirst driverless cars are overwhelmingly innovative. It states in the passage \"Originally,many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads\". This is putting into perspective that even futurists didn't believe it was possible but Google has achieved this monument to perfection. Also in the ariticle it says \"founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream\". As the original founder of this project he has even reached the level of innovation that he has been striving and working for since 2009.\r\n\r\nSecondly alot of major car companies are striving for making their product driveless. For example in the passage it conveys \"Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time\". This is shownig how a major car company as innovative as Tesla is going to release a self driving car of their own. In that same paragraph it informs \"Mercendes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020\". Showing that even some of the luxury brands and the major car compaines are releasing a driverless car. Showing how they agreee with where the future is going and how much of a phenomenal idea it is.",
        "In this article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", the author talks about the aspects of driverless cars. To me driverless cars can be a bad thing. Just think about a car running on its own without a driver. That's basically impossible and also scary. I feel like cars should always have a driver inside them.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars can sometimes be a danger to people. If the car was completly driverless then it wouldn't need human skills. A driverless car shouldn't be able to use human skill. It should be able to do everything when needed to. The driver must remain alert when in a driverless car. They must keep their hands near the steering wheeling at all times to be ready to take control.\r\n\r\nDrivers would get bored just sitting around waiting for the car to alert them. Why would anyone want to buy a driverless car isn't in full control? People shouldn't make driverless cars becasue it could probably hurt someone. What happens if the technology fails? Whose fault would it be if it does fail? In case of an accident, there should be laws. Where would they sell these cars.\r\n\r\nIf the technology ever fails I feel like it would be the drivers fault. It would be their fault simply because they were so eager to try out the driverless car. They thought it would be so perfect to try it out. But then it would the inventor's fault because they were the ones that invented it.",
        "In the article \"Driveless Cars Are Coming\" the author talks a lot about how driveless cars could be a good thing and a bad thing. My thoughts on driveless cars are negitive. My thoughts are only negitive because anything could go wrong.\r\n\r\nOne of my thoughts on driveless cars are what if you have to suddenly stop in an unknown place how whould the car know it has to stop. A driveless car could be or maybe would be the cause of most car accidents. Everyone wouldnt even know how to work it because we wernt born with it. It would maybe be a great technology but most people wouldnt be confortable doing or not doing something they havent did all their lifes.\r\n\r\nAnother one of my thoughts on driveless cars is when i think about a driveless car i think about all technology and there isnt a 100% chance that there wont be a malfunction. Most technology makes mistakes of has some type of glitch, so why would you put your life in the hands of a driveless car.\r\n\r\nOn earth, people are becoming lazier as the day goes by all the technology we have barely makes us want to move off of our couches. Which would also be another negitive thought about driveless cars.",

Be you and if you want to try something new like studying Venus because if its a worthy persuit it can be good for you because you may learn new things you have never been able to learn. What if one day they send you into space or Venus to check out you can not be scared because there are times when you get scared and that messes all your plans up and you back out.

        "With all of the advances that car companys are making there is no doubt that driverless cars are on their way to Americas roadways. The author of this article makes some good points supporting driverless cars, but they also makes some good points that lead me to be against them. I have not seen enough evidence to prove them safe.\r\n\r\nRight now we get some comfort when we see a large SUV barreling down the road, at least there is a human in charge of the vehicle that is hopfully paying attention to the driving task ahead of them. I just don't believe that a computer would be able to make all of the logical descisions neccasary for safe travel. Lets take interstate driving for example. When driving on the interstate you have to be able to quickly make decisions when someone darts in front of you, or when to pass somebody. Computers wouldn't be able to make these decisions on thier own.\r\n\r\nNow lets look at it from a legal view. The author covers some of the legal issues in paragraph nine. In the very last sentence of paragraph nine the author asks \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- The driver or the manufacturer?\" Thinking logically I have arrived at the conclusion that it would be the manufacturers fault. The driver isn't the one driving, it's the manufacturors system that is in control. This can only lead me to believe that if the manufacturer is the one that made the system, if it fails the manufacturer is to be held responsible for the failure.",
        "While it is incredible that Prof. Thomas Huang has developed this mechanism to read anyone's emotions, it should not be implemented in the classroom. As humans, we have the basic right to freedom of speech which allows us to speak our opinions, but it also allows us to keep some things to ourself, and that includes our emotions.\r\n\r\nSome peole are better at reading emotions and body language than others, and nobody can do anything about that. But sometimes students conceal emotions from teachers for reasons, and sometimes kids just want to figure out how to perform tasks on their own. If a student is taking an online course and appears confused, it's best to let them decide whether or not they need to be taught more about the subject or it they are jsut struggling with a certain aspect of it. Also, if a student's face is 45% concentrated and 55% confused, they may not want the computer to bombard them with a lesson and break their concentration, which would end up frustrating the student. In paragraph 6, the author says, \"Imagine a computer that knows when you\u2019re happy or sad.\" While it could be beneficial for a computer to know what emotions the students in the lesson are feeling, what would it do if the student was overwhelmed by emotions that weren't related to the lesson at hand? Woult the computer be able to decipher what emotions were related to the lesson and which were just carried over from their home life or other things?\r\n\r\nIn paragaph 6, the author says, \"Imagine a computer that knows when you\u2019re happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" there are already many people who are against the idea of personalized ads, and think they are an invasion of privacy.",
        "Driverless cars are too expensive, trivial, and dangerous to be developed for public use. The development of these cars would require extensive funding, and this money could be much better spent. Some of these cars would only be partially automated and would still require a capable driver at all times, so what would be the point? Finally, driverless cars would be concerning from a safety standpoint - would these cars really be able to safely maneuver out of dangerous situations?\r\n\r\nFirst, the development of driverless cars would be expensive. Automated cars require many sensors and cameras that regular cars do not need, and even with these sensors, the cars are not capaple of completely driving themselves. In order to achieve a reliable driverless system, all of our roads would have to have electricity or magnets installed, which even the article admits would be \"too expensive to be practical\". Furthermore, the money spent on developing these cars could be spent to help those who are less fortunate rather than creating new things for ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with driverless cars is the idea of cars that only assist the driver. These cars would drive most of the time, but they would, \"notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents\". These cars would certainly be helpful, but what would be the point of having a self-driving car if you still have to watch the road as if you were driving yourself? Some manufacturers talk of adding, \"in-car entertainment and information systems,\" but if the driver were focused on these systems, would they be able to react quickly enough if the car approached a dangerous situation?",
        "If you could buy a car that could drive you around, with you not having to do anything, would you buy it? Personally, I would not. There are to many things that could go wrong. We all know that technology can break down at times. Even our computers break down for no reason at times. So why let a car, that could end your life in a split second, drive you around? I wouldn't want to take that risk.\r\n\r\nIn the passage \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" they explain that even at times the driver has to take over. They said, \"the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" What if, one time, the car did not notify the driver or the driver falls asleep? This could end the drivers life and someone else's. Yes, in the passage they state \"the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.\" But, I know plenty of people, mostly teenagers, that would disconnect the wheel sensor. So again, why take this chance to end peoples life for some Driverless Car?\r\n\r\nIf we are going to have Driverless Cars then, they need to be a little safer before anyone can drive them. If we can't get our computers to work correctly sometimes, then why are we inventing Driverless Cars?",
        "The Face on Mars\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen the face on Mars? If so do you think it was a natural landform or alien made? So let's assume you think it is made by aliens and i think it wasnt. I think it wasnt because there have been things like this on earth but obviously not as big of a dent on earth. I personally think it was a natural thing like when clouds look like faces or random objects. People dont say clouds like that are made by aliens.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think it isnt alien made is because there are things on Earth comparable to the face on Mars. We don't think those are alien made. We also see clouds everday that look like faces or random objects so therefore there isnt a diffrence between the two. The only difference being clouds are in the sky and the face on Mars is on Mars.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you could also compare is the face on Mars to it the easter island heads. They are gigantic statues that kinda look like the face on Mars. A lot of people also say that those are alien made but other people could also argue they arent because they have an opinion. Most likely they will express there opinion too but it is a matter of opinion and no facts because there isnt way to tell if the face on Mars was made by aliens or not.",

I believe this because now and days you see that a lot of car accidents happen with texting and driving and also with drinking and driving. Now imagine how great it would be if those types of accidents would stop happening, well driverless cars are the answer. Now and days people can be very irresponsible and hurt others by their actions but these cars can help save lives and a lot of them. This can help keep pedestrians safe and even the drivers. Many deaths happen every year because of drivers not being able to be alert when driving, well with this type technology we can prevent this from happening. These cars will most likely be programmed to follow the law, as in mainting the speed limit and not doing illegal things on the road as in skipping a stop sign or a red light. These cars will also be able to help those who aren't able to drive like blind people, short people, and handicaped people these cars will be able to take them to their destination safely. These cars will be a great help to a lot of people who are irresponsible and to those with disadvantages. In conclusion I do believe they should develop these cars because it would be a great help to people.",

        "New software has been created to determine the facial expressions of students. It uses technology to give data as to what emotions someone is feeling such as happiness, sadness, and boredom. These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning. However, the use of software to determine the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is not valuable to the students learning experience.\r\n\r\nTo start, in order for this new technology to work, students woukld have to constantly be watched by cameras that read their expressions. This is said in the text when it says, \"Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements,\" (D'Alto 4). One can see from this that the students would always have to be watched and their facial movements would all be recorded. This could be an issue of privacy for some students if they do not want to constantly be recorded. It also makes it easy for outside threats to hack this system and watch students or get personal information from the videos. Emotion-recognition software can also be expensive for schools, especially since it doesnt work on normal PC computers. The text states, \" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" (D'Alto 7). This shows that normal computers that students would typically use cannot support this technology, making the school buy the technology that can support it. This would be a costly job and if the school cannot pay for it then the students would have to and some families may not be able to afford it. Lastly, students facial expressions may not directly correlate with the emotion they are feeling towards the lesson that they are learning.",
        "I see that you believe that the Face could mean that there are or were a sort of life form on Mars. This is easy to belive at first glance, but we decided to look further. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over this red planet. The MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed a natural landform. This concluded that there was no alien monument on Mars.\r\n\r\nBut many theorists, like yourself, stayed unconvinced. Again on April 8, 2001 another photo was taken. This time the photo was taken by Malin's team, and they used the camera's maximum resloution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This means that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. The image taken actually portrays a Martian version of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the American West.",
        "The technology emotional expression is helpful because now that we have that we can look back at old pictures and wonder. What was Abraham so mad about? Or why was George Washington so happy but sad about? This experiment can change the way we look at history.\r\n\r\nThis experiment can help us more understand the past. Like the Mona Lisa nobody knew she had all that emotion in her when she took that picture. Because her smile was so big it stood out. When really she was happy but had all these other emotions in her that we didn't know she had.\r\n\r\nThis can help students by doing projects on the person they picked and they can research a pciture and then use the experiment to discover their emotions at the time. This new experiment can change alot of wrong discovers that were made in the past. Now we can know more with the new emotional expressions.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to tell if some one is lying or telling the truth. It's so many celebrities that put on a fake smile to the press when really there's something going on behind closed doors. This new thing can help people that have problems because we can see how they really feel. Say if we used this in the school year book and we use it on a student that does abd in school or is always in trouble.",
        "I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it a really good program. You will see lots of different things that you probabaly have never seen before. Wouldn't that be cool? I was one and it was a lot of fun. You get to meet new people and see new things.\r\n\r\nSome things that are a downside are when you are on the ship and a storm comes you have to make sure everything is latched shut and close everything. You also have to make sure that no one or nothing gets thrown overboard. It almost happened to me once, I was a watchman on my second trip. My job was to check on all of the animals every hour. Well, one night I was doing just that and I slid down a slippery ladder. I thought that I was going to go overboard, my heart was racing as I shot feet first toward a big opening in the side of the ship. I thought I was going to die, but I didn't obviously cause I'm still here talking to you. Well, a small metal strip stopped my slide, keeping me from going overboard. It was the best moment of my life when that metal strip saved me.\r\n\r\nNow that that is over with I am goign to tell you some amazing places you might be able to go. These trips where amazing for a small town boy like me. I would have so much fun in the places that we would go.",
        "I think that using the Facial Action Coding System could be a valuable tool in the classroom. This technology could help teachers teach efficiently in a classroom. It could tailor the learning experience so that each student's feelings are interpreted and addressed properly. This could also help online learning systems by giving easier questions or explaining things with more depth when certain faces are made.\r\n\r\nThe facial expression for each emotion is universal. Different muscles make different faces to show different emotions. Facial muscle movement can even show mixed emotions. With the new technology a person's face is compared to and judged by neutral faces. This can help identify and distinguish specific emotions, and make it easier to get inside a student's head.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of using computers to determine feeling is being able to tailor learning to an individual's feelings. The computers can recognize feelings like disgust, confusion, and boredom. This way it can be known if a teacher's lesson becomes too cumbersome, or if the teacher doesn't explain things quite right. Then they can know when they need to slow down and take a little more time with the topic, and therefore teach students more effectively.\r\n\r\nOnline learning or learning from a computer would benefit as well. Teachers can identify different emotions in different students. Humans can sort of \"calculate\" different emotions ourselves. If a student is learning from a computer it can be difficult to adjust the lesson to the student's needs. If the computer can recognize different emotions then it could try to present the information in different preset ways. If the student is bored the computer could give a humorous example to explain the problem or make it more interesting so that the learning process is easier. If the student appears confused the computer could slow down and go over the past few things it just taught.",

In 2009, Google had already created a car that was almost completely independent and, many other companies such as General Motors had created similar cars. These cars have many unknown variables that still need to be worked out but, driverless cars will be a positive change towards the future.\r\n\r\nScientist have been working on creating a driverless car for years. As of 2009, Google created an almost independent car. The car could do almost anything. the downfall was that the car still relied on driver control in situations such as traffic construction zones. These cars have alert systems to alert the driver when human assistance is needed. Therefor these cars are still safe to operate but not completely independant.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the driverless cars being invented today have a great deal of sensors.\r\n\r\nThese sensors allow the cars to distinguish thier surroundings, giving the most amount of safety possible. These cars are also more fuel efficient and eco friendly. They will use less fuel and will be equipped with many safety features. These new features allow the car to see 360 degrees around the vehicle and keep the passenger as safe and comfortable as posible.\r\n\r\nAs of now, many of these cars still need human attention when driving. They are equipped with vibrating seats and sensors on the wheel to monitor that the human is alert.",

        "Twenty five years ago something very uncommon happened on our planet Mars. NASA sent a shuttle taht can take pictures of anything, NASA sent the shuttle out into space. The shuttle NASA sent out was called \"Viking 1\". Viking 1 was a shuttle that took (past tence) pictures of plantes. NASA sent the shuttle out to look for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. As the shuttle taking pictures it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. The Human face had a enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. Threw the cameras it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Those are some little details about the \"Human Face\".\r\n\r\nEven though i'm a scientist at NASA, some of my friends who were also scientist we all agreed it was probably it was just another Martian mesa, they were common around Cydonia, but this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. I was dissusing the \"Face\" with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. I was telling him (John) we unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" But now that the word got out people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. He was also saying \"Its evidence that evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" Me personally believed the Face was an alien artifact.\r\n\r\nAnd so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, so friends Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera which we called (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos.",
        "Driverless cars have always been a big idea for the future. However, there are some really important pros and cons for driverless cars. Driverless cars can be very dangerous to not only the individual driving, but also to everyone around. Perhaps driverless cars isn't such a good idea. Your biggest concerns would be the technology failing and the safety of everyone around it.\r\n\r\nSafety is the MAIN key to a driverless car. Since a driverless car would be driverless, not only the driver would need to be alert but everyone around it would need to be, which is common sense for any type of vehicle or transportation. Considering the fact that the human being is always in charge of an accident with a regular car. That woudn't be the case for a \"driverless car\". Now even though the driverless car have sensors and other types of monitoring to prevent accidents and disfunctions, who's to say the driver isn't paying attention when they need to be and something goes wrong. In paragraph 9 it talks about how traffic laws are wriiten to assume that the human is in control at all times. That's completely understandable, if the human doesn't do what he needs to do to make sure his manufacturer is working correctly, it would be his fault for not taking care of it.\r\n\r\nFor everyone else around a driverless car, would always be in great danger. No matter how well the car itself is functioning, you dont know if everyone else is paying attention to their own vehicle. Pedestrians around the driverless cars have no control over what it does. If something happens to a pedestrian, who's responsibility is that? If a sensor on the car isn't working properly, which it should be, there would be more deaths and injuries to people around the vehicle and to the person inside of the vehicle. The minor issues of a driverless vehicle could cause a huge problem.\r\n\r\nEven though having a driverless car seems like such a good idea, there could be many things to go wrong.",
        "Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is one of the brightest points of light in the sky... That is a good point to start an investigation.\r\n\r\nIt is called ''The Earth Twin'' because Venus is the most closest in density, size and distance too. Humans have sent a lot of spacecrafts to study a phenomenom related with the speed of the planets that are in our solar system, all of the times that humans have sent spacecrafts trying to stdy Venus they just got the destruction of them, that could be the reason of why Venus have not being touched in the past thirty years, that is why humans want to know new qualities, more than the ones that we already know.\r\n\r\nOne of the factors that makes Venus one of the most challenging planets to study is its thick atmosphere, which is composed of almost 100 percent of a kind of ''blankets'', under those ''blankets'' are clouds containing sulfuric acid. Humans just cannot go and walk in Venus as we did in the Moon, and that is because Venus has a lot of extreme environments, which are too different to any environment we can find in the Earth, these conditions are the insane temperatures, Venus has the hottest surface than any other planet in our solar system, not even Mercury has a surface like that. The temperature in Venus could reach a level of 800 degrees Fahrenheit which is a totaly unknown temperature for humans. Another extreme fact of Venus's environment is its atmospheric pressure which is more than 90 times greater that the pressure we experience in the Earth. But that is not all about Venus, the geology and weather that Venus presents include erupting volcanoes, earthquakes and sometimes it gets some lightning strikes.\r\n\r\nHumans are completly surprised by Venus and its environment today, because there are astronomers who could be totally sure about Venus having oceans and a few forms of life a long time ago, those who can be sure about it say that Venus still has some features similar to the Earth, some of them are valleys, mountains and craters.\r\n\r\nNASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus, it will be so complicated to do, but the astronomers say that is the only way to get more information of Venus, having humans in the surface of Venus they could take samples of rock, gas, or anything else. Astronomers say that if they really want to know more about Venus they have to be there and experience all its difficulties despite the risks. They take all of its difficulties as challenges. Many others astronomers are working in machines that could be send to Venus, maybe that is because they think that step the surface of Venus is completly impossible.",

It was a unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, (He mentioned in paragraph 4) not only did I help people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe,China, and Acropolis in Greece which was special. I also got to care for animals (as mentioned in paragraph 6). Helping out at aunt Katie's farm prepared me for hard work but not for the dangers of the sea (as mentioned in paragraph 7).\r\n\r\nWhen I was serving as a nightman on my second trip, I still checked on the animals every hour (as mentioned in paragraph 7). One rainy night I injured my ribs but didn't fly off the ship and though I still couldn't work for a few days I was happy to be alive (as mentioned in paragraph 7). I had a fun time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The other cowboys and I played baseball and Volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been housed (as mentioned in paragaph 8). I'm grateful for the opportunity and I t made me more aware of other people of other countries and their needs (as mentioned in paragraph 9).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion should join this program because of the sight seeing and fun you'll have.",

A good exapmle of a question that most readers will thnk of would be \"Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?\"(Paragraph 4). This question not only supports his claim but also gains the readers trust knowing that the author is very informed about what he/she is talking about and knows what the readers want to know about.

Driverless cars may in fact reduce collisions with other cars due to human error, but computer errors can just as likely occur.

Drivers that use driverless cars would not have enough experiance behind the wheel to fix, or take over the car if needed.

This creation can help our world have safer roads, better environment, and could actually help our environment in many ways. With the correct technology and great intention, we could eventually live in a futuristic type of world like we have always seen in movies.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars aren't actually driverless quite yet, but they still need assitance in different occassions.

The conditions where it can't perform by itself is pulling out of drive ways or driving around complex traffic. These cars still allow one to drive but it also is a way for people to sit back and just enjoy the ride. So although we might not have complete driverless cars, we have already been proven that it is possible top have a car that drives safely by itself.\r\n\r\nSince we have seen that these cars can perform safely without an accident occurring, think of how many less accidents would occur. Many lives have been lost due to drunk driving, reckless driving, and even texting while driving. With these cars that perform on their own, people will no longer have to drive under the influence. People will now have the chance to text or call while in the car, and it will eliminate more accidents from occurring by this type of reckless driving.",

While these conspiracy theorist go with the common opinion about it floating around, and do no reasearch at all. The conspiracy theorists think that may NASA is hiding the fact that aliens have made this from the public because it may harm their budget. Taking this to 1976, camera resolution wasn't high enough to take good high quality photos yet because the technology was behind. The picture was blurry and it was one of those, \"you've got to see it to believe it\" moments because nothing could be made out from it. This is probably where that \"aliens made this\" conspiracy came from, the photo is so blurry looks as though some sort of alien space craft had landed here or the doing of aliens for artwork.

        "I think there should be driverless cars in the development and hope there is a legitiment product for one. For one it may be safer than actual drivers driving a car. It can save alot of natural resources for gas.\r\n\r\nThe big concern for the whole article is that if the automated car can be safe and I can tell you that the manufacturer's are working on it. According to the text: \"some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Sush displayscan be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to drivers to text aith a cell hpone.\"",
        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author claims that studying Venus is worth the possible risks and dangers, because as science evolves technology and experiments should evolve too. Venus, also called Earths's \"twin\", could be a planet that was actually visited by humans and make the innovation of technology even greater.\r\n\r\nThe author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers, because Venus could have been at one point our most Earth-like planet and may eventually become a planet that is able to sustain life. Venus had at one point contained similar characteristics like that of Earth, and could possibly be an opportunity for sending a human to another planet which could advance technology enough to sustain life there. The author states, \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit\". The fact that Venus could have possibly sustained life in the past means that there is a slight window of opportunity for it to sustain humans and be \"our nearest option for a planetary visit\" again.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System created by Dr. Paul Eckman, it is a man-made computer, in which it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Many would say that this new break in technology is useless, but there is more that meets the eye when it comes to the Facial Action Coding System. This coding system can read the emotional expressions of any student in a classroom! This is extreamly useful as it can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, it will then modify the lesson to fit the needs of that student, and human communication is nonverbal so therfore the computers are trained to react like a human in any situation.\r\n\r\nWhen a child is sitting in a classroom with many other students while the teacher is explaining a lesson plan, they might fall to boredom or simply be confused. Many students could say, that they have at one point or another felt overwhelmed by a certain lesson in their classroom. The Action Coding System can, as said by Dr. Huang, \"..recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" Imagine having a computer that would allow you to read into the emotion of a student. This device could be the greatest asset to any teacher. Many students will subside their emotion for the thought of being cast out by their peers for not understanding a lesson, now with the Action Coding System created a student will not feel the pressure of being discriminated against, and teachers have a reliable source of technology to make sure their classrooms are being used to the best of their ability.\r\n\r\nAs well, the Action Coding System not only can scan a student's emotions, but when it finds a student confused or bored, it will modify the lesson for the child. As said by Dr, Huang, \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This piece of technology can even modify a lesson plan for a child struggeling to understand the curriculum or a student who struggles with ADHD. A teacher with this device could always know what is happeing in her class and how his/her students are feeling.",

The author has different details and has found them.\r\n\r\nThe author talks about different stuff how our sister plant is so inhospitable\". Scientists also see and search what's going on in the world and in the planets. I think it's good that we know some of these stuff so we know in the future that can happen. If you don't know none of these details you can search stuff online.\r\n\r\nIt's also good knowing these stuff because it's better to know them. Scientists do a lot of researching that's going around the world and earth. Also Venus is worthy to know what dangercan happen. It can get to 170 degrees Fahrenheit the air will be close to the area.\r\n\r\nThe solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels.

        "In this article Driverless Cars are coming i agree with them. It would be nice to have cars that can help us drive or even drive for us. First that would be really good for peoplewho drink and drive. Then it would be the same for\r\n\r\npeople who are tired from work or an type of activity and cant drive because there just so tired.Plus i feel its a good investment in our country, instead of getting a taxi.\r\n\r\nFirst i think its a good idea because the people who drink and drive now have this driverless car to take them home. There friends dont have to worry if he or she made it home safetly cause there is this car that is\r\n\r\nkeeeping them safe from driving. They wont hurt anybody or themselves. Also if they do try to drive and put there hand on the wheel maybe they should have the car sense there is too much alchahol in there system.Like how paragraph 4 said that \"they will needed a\r\n\r\nwhole lot of sensors\" for the car so maybe then can put a sensor like that put in the car.\r\n\r\nThen the people who are tired from work and from doing something very tiring or the people who cant see even at night\r\n\r\nand they suufer from driving and they end up up a car crash so the car can help\r\n\r\nthem out a lot because many people suffer from not seeing in the dark when they drive. Or when you\r\n\r\ngo grocery shopping and your reallly tired and cant really much for yourself the car is there for you to take you home.\r\n\r\nLast, its a good investment for our country in paragraph 1 they mention that\r\n\r\n\"the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibllity than a bus.\" so i feel why not take up that offer when there is so many companies out there that offer a taxie system, so we can replace all of that and save more money in this counry and possibly other contries.",
        "Why do you think the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit disregarding the danger that is being presented.\r\n\r\nVenus is the closest planet to Earth which is why it is referred to as the Earths ''twin''. Most people study geography which is all around the world such as Earth. Meanwhile, others are studying or learning more about venus . Such as , venus is more dangerous because of how close it is to the sun and carbon dioxide that revolves around it.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is also an effect on how dangerous it is .\r\n\r\nEven though mercury is closer to the sun venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet . This can result in erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes .Others on the other hand are fascinated by Venus because it has been the most Earth - like planet in our solar system . Earth is covered of different bodies of water and that could support different forms of life. Venus a very long time ago ,was also covered in large oceans which help others to adapt to . Planetary visiters put the option of venus out there because of its physical features such as valleys,mountains and craters. The NASA is sending people who are intrested in studying space and planets to visit Venus.\r\n\r\nThe people who are going to traveling on ship will not see as much due to the dense atmosphere .You aren't going to be able to take sample of things from a distance because of the risk that will be taken . Risk like taking resources from the planet can harm you . They are making different ways to travel to venus so it would be worth the time period and not limited.\r\n\r\nThe authors has used a good choice of words by saying ''that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presesnt . The trip would be very observative and informational .",

Do you think that the face is actually a face?\r\n\r\nA few days after NASA sent Viking 1 to Mars to take pictures, they got back photos of a face. Not just any face, it was a human face. Not only is this crazy, it's impossible. It's impossible because we spent a lot of time and money reaserching if humans can go live on Mars. And it has been scientifcally proven by us that no human can live on Mars, so for that reason I don't know how that human face got there in the first place.\r\n\r\nI know that some people think that maybe aliens are the ones who made the face, and you may be right. In some cases though, while we we'er reaserching, we would have noticed already. What we think it is is a natural landform. I know that it sounds crazy, but it is a possibility. It would make more sense if it was a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIf you can't decide if it's a face, aliens, or just a natural landform, then let me take some details from the article to support my idea.",

        "We humans have been trying to discover aliens for more than a million years. Why have we not found them yet? We have been up in space multiple times and we have had yet another more multipe times sent space robots that went into orbital. So ask your self this question why have we not found aliens yet?\r\n\r\nI think due to evidence that it is a natural landform. I think it is a natural landform because in paragraph one it states that \"...when it spotted the shadowly likeness of a human face.\" When I read this I then concluded that it only really looked like a human because of the shadows that make up the \"eyes, nose and mouth\" in which makes this rock figure looking as if it has a face. I do think that is a natural rock landform because God created the earth so that only people would live on earth. Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible. Another example of why that the \"face\" on Mars is a natural landform is because it states in the text on paragraph seven that \"There was no alien monument after all.\" This is poroving that even scienctists have conculuded that there was no landform on mars. Then on April 8, 2001 the space station found to \"face landform\".",

It would probably say how they feel out loud, and maybe someone doesnt want to be pointed out. \"You can tell how someone feels by their actions and look on their face\", I don't think they'd need a \"robot\" to understand how someone feels in that exact moment. I think teachers or whoever themselves should go up to that person and have a proivate conversation, some teachers see the facial expressions on some students and wont bother to ask. I feel like the technology would be expensive as well and they would need a lot of them. It would just be a waste of money. Plus, it goes by your facial expressions. I don't believe it would actually tell you how you feel.",
        "For someone who does not believe in aliens, this is only but a mere coincidence. We have no facts to prove that it WAS made by aliens, furthermore there being a whole civilization of aliens living on mars. There are many landforms as this one on Mars, and even on Earth, that happen to show some type of face, or object that would rather look man-made or even \"alien\" made. Just because there is a landform that has a shape, and look of a face, doesn't neccessarily mean that there is a life-form living on Mars. For there to be some type of life-for on Mars, yes, it would most benefit NASA, by finding out what is that life-form, how its living, and so on. But for someone to think that alien life-forms made this landform of a face, you can't really say that aliens have done so without having the proper information that shows, \"aliens\" have done so.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, from the photograph, we can say that yes, it does look like a face. But at this time, technology wasn't at it's highest. Since technology hadn't been as high tech as it is now, we could assume that, of the photo were taken now, yes, it'd be much more different, more defined. More so, there had been more photos taken on April 5th, 1998, with photos sharper than the original, being said that there had been no alien monument after all.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this argument, you could still go on saying how aliens are real, and how they created this landform.

        "Driverless cars being brought into the world sounds like a dream come true, no more worrying about horrible car accidents, or having the urge to text and drive at the same time, right? Wrong. Having driverless cars may sound like a good idea, but to me they're not. Especially when a persons' fate in being messed with.Plus bringing driverless cars into mind would also bring an even lazier world, and people that work as driving instructors would be out of a job. Having driverless cars will lead to humans becoming lazier than they already are, twice as many car accidents as there were before, and some lots of people around the world wouldn't have a job.\r\n\r\nCar accidents can happen anywhere at anytime, and they are not a pretty sight to look at. Most car accidents happen during \" work traffic\" and on the highway. Now think of how many more car accidents would happen if we have \"smart\" cars driving by themselves. The damge would be horrific. In the passage, paragraphs 7-8, they talk mainly about how even though these are computer engineered cars, they still would need human assistance if nessecary. A line from paragraph 7 says \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselevs, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" This sentence showed that even though these are smart cars, humans still have to be alert at all time. But what if the technology in the smart car refuses to provide smart alerts and warnings to the human? This would lead to a huge accident. And since the law doesn't know wheather to blame it on the manufracturer or the driver, its completely pointless to take the risk of putting these cars on the road.",
        "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" was a interesting factual article to read. My opion on driverless cars is they're not a good idea. I am against driverless cars. My reasons for this are an increasing rate of accidents, technology failing, and the cost. In the following paragraphs are reasons why I am against the ideal of driverless cars.\r\n\r\nStarting off, my first reason for being against driverless cars was the increasing rate of accidents. Not all drivers pay attention to the road while driving (especially teens) and riding in a driverless car, coming into a situation that requires a human being to take control of the wheel can lead to accidents if they're not paying attention. The rates of car accidents are already high till this day, just imagine how high the rate would be having driverless cars. It may not even be the drivers fault, a glitch can happen with the car causing it to get into a accident injuring somebody, as said in passage 9; who's fault would it be then? The person or the manufacturers fault? That is my first reasoning opposing driverless cars.\r\n\r\nNext, my second reason was the technology failing. We live in a society where technology advances EVERYDAY, but there is always a complications with technology. Updated technology isn't always perfect. For instence the computer system in the car could crash, shutting off the whole car, there might be a hay wire causing the car to spin out of control, causing an accident, and even a more dangerous situation the car could explode or catch on fire due to the technology. An example of today's most updated piece of technology that went bad is the \"Hoover Board,\" many people could just be riding on it, and it could burst into flames. The same thing could happen with driverless cars.",

So this is a not a good option to used in a clasroom because if you fells happy, or sad, the teacher can ask you if yor are mad because acording with the computer you are.\r\n\r\nOr your friends see the program that says you are happy, but yourself is sad, your friend will be start to joke with you and, you do not liked, maybe they will be have problems.",
        "Venus is possibly the closest to Earth in size and density then and other planet. Which, makes you belive that just maybe, us humans can live on Venus just as we do live on Earth. Even tho Venus is very similar to our Earth it is very different. For example, Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Even the surface is affected and can average 800 degrees Farenheit. Even though these conditons are too extreme for our human kind. We can possibly create something or discover something greater that can withstand all of those extreme enviorments.\r\n\r\nEarth has an abundant of shapes and sizes of clouds. Not only do we have clouds that not only look beautiful, we also tend to have clouds that can harm us. Between a mixture of fog and rain it creates smog,which, can harm our skin. Not only does Earth have clouds, Venus does too. But Venus has clouds that can potentially kill all of human kind or melt through many types of metal. Venus has these very high corrosive sulfuric acid clouds in the atmosphere that would be a big problem for us humans to explore Venus.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, all of these conditions on Venus doesnt have to be as problem as long as we can create or discover something to counteract the conditions.",
        "Driverless cars have both a postive and negative side. It can help people or it can harm them. Those who invented driverless cars had a vision on making it easier for people, but are they really making it easier? My position on driverless cars is neutral. I think it can benefit us but also take us down.\r\n\r\nMany people may be confused on what driverless cars means, in my point of view they're cars that drive you to your destination without you having to do anything but getting in the car. Google confounder Sergey Brin's definition is different. Driverless cars to him are those who still need human assistance. Paragraph 7 states \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills...\". The Google car tells the driver when it's time to take over.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 2 it says \"Their cars have driven up to half a million miles without a crash...\" it may be safe but also dangerous if you don't know how to control it. Humans can take over if needed to and the way these cars are invented they need a lot of sensor for it to work, but sensors aren't anything new. In paragraph 7 it says \" While the driver watches the road, the car watches\r\n\r\nthe driver.\" saying the driver stills need to be on alert if anything is needed. The car and the driver are basically friends helping each other make it to the destination safely.\r\n\r\nThe thing to question is if an accident occured with a driverless car who's fault would it be? The drivers or the manufacturer? The manufacturer wouldn't want any problems and neither would the individual. They even quetioned who's fault it would be in paragraph 9 because they don't know the answer.If it affects the individual and they are the ones that got hurt it wouldn't even cross my mind to get one of these cas.",

        "I am against driverless cars being made. I think it will be too dangerous. It's cool that they are being made, but it will not end well. There are too many things to worry about with them. I think it's a bad thing because there are dangerous drivers out there, there are many road hazards, and weather conditions can make it even more dangerous.\r\n\r\nSome drivers are already making the roads more hazardous. They do things like speed, illegal turns, and do not use blinkers. With a human driver behind the wheel, if they see this they will most likely avoid the person the best they can, but what will a driverless car do. It might not be able to detect them so if it makes a turn, not knowing about the wreckless driver, it can cause an accident. The car can follow the rules of the road, but without human instincts, it's just waiting to get hit. This can very bad and effect a lot of people's thought about purchasing one of these vehicles.\r\n\r\nIt says in paragraph 7 that the driver must be ready to drive, just in case the car approaches a work zone, but what about small hazards. While the feature alerts them about work zones, it doesn't say anything about alerting the driver about a pot hole or dangerous material in the road. If it's driving in a small city, there could be some kind of hazard that needs a human to know how to avoid it. How would the car know to alert them if it hasn't seen anything like it before? It can alert for simple things, but for things like pot holes, it's better just to have someone behind the wheel instead of risking falling into the hole because the car didn't alert you to take over.\r\n\r\nDriving in bad weather can still be a problem. In paragraph 5, it states how it could react better than a human, stopping individual wheels and making it a lot less likely to skid out, but its not fullproof.",
        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. These cars have been thought of in 2009 and have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash. The negative way is that most people will still have to be alert and this will cost more money, and depending on the crash of both veichle and drive we will not be able to fiigure out who has done it.\r\n\r\nMost people are having a hard time focusing on the road just because of texting or being on the phone with others. There were positive ways of the driverless cars,but there are limits these cars can face.\r\n\r\nThere are some positive ways of the driverless cars. In 2009, google cars has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions. These cars read the positive and negative polarity as messgae in the binary code.There were also sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes, they have become more advanced in the pass ten years. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer. Driverless cars will give the driver more time to text and finish phone calls with others.

They decided that it was another Martian mesa which were common around Cydonia.\r\n\r\nA few days after, NASA unveiled the image for all people to see. When they released the photo, the caption was \"huge rock formation.\" Some of the scientists say that the rock formation looks like a face. They said \"formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" An author later decided that the Face would be a great way to get the public's attention and attract them to Mars.\r\n\r\nAfter the Face was released to the public, it became a pop icon around the world. the Face appeared in Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. In the passage it says, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" This is evidence that NASA wanted to hide from the public. Some say that the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look.

        "I am for the development of smart/driverless cars. I have chosen to support these cars because they will use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus, they can sense the road and dangers better, and the cars require little human attention.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the cars will potentially replace taxi services. I think this will be a great idea because while you would still have to pay for the service, there is no human element of error. If there is an element of error, however, you will be the one at fault because you are the only passenger and driver. I believe the replacement of the traditional taxi service is a good thing.\r\n\r\nThe smart cars are good at sensing dangers on the road ahead. Because the cars have technology that can even start to turn on the brakes before the driver can, the driver will be safer and does not have to respond as quickly. The \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" is a good development because the driver must still remain alert but the car does most of the work.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think the smart cars are a good idea to develop because they allow the driver to be safe in a vehicle that they are not in full control of.",

        "Is the face on Mars the face of a new discovery in our universe? When a face was discovered on Mars, the idea of it was quite controversial. Generally speaking, the face on Mars was just a pop icon, not a sign of life. The face on Mars was proven to be a simple landform because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to determine, there were no signs of any civilization, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. The Face on Mars was just a pop icon and a skeptic's thought, not a sign of martian life or civilization.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to find evidence, when all they found was a natural landform.\r\n\r\nThe Red Planet was very cloudy that time of year, and theorists believed that the haze was hiding any martian evidence or civilization. However, it is not easy to target Cydonia, because of Mars' natural orbit and the fog and haze Mars receives every so often. So, in 2001, NASA sent the Surveyor back up to Mars to take pictures and investigate.\r\n\r\nWhen the photos were taken, the photos were discerned three times bigger than the pixel size, and no signs of civilization appeared.",

This from of technology is unpresidented their is nothing else out there like it. This Facial Action system have many uses that can be aplied to schools, art, and law enforecment. This would help teachers to be able to see what emotions that this person is having because it is important what your students are trying to learn.\r\n\r\nIn a school where you are teaching math you would like to know what a student was thinking Dr. Huang said that \"when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" you would be able to tell with the Facial Action Coding System.

These classroom computers will be able to tell us what we fell about the subject so lets say we are confused and the teacher knows that he could explain what is being taught to you in a different way so that you get it. The instruct can also see if you are bored so he can tell you to snap back into it or let the class take a little break.

        "I am personally against the idea of driverless cars. Some people are already dangerous behind the wheel as it is. I don't think a computer would do any better behind the wheel. Dirverless cars can be very dangerous and I think people would be better off not being lazy and driving themselves where ever they needed to go.\r\n\r\nOne reason that I am against driverless cars is that they are not 100% driverless. There are still issues that the car can't handle on it's own and will require the driver to take over. Driverless cars can be very dangerous because if the car would ever require the driver, and it fails to alert the driver in time, there could be fatal consequences. Drunk drivers could also try to take advantage of the fact that the car would be driverless and have the car drive itself. But if he driver were to be too drunk to take over, it could casue a very bad accident.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that I am against driverless cars is that they would be compter dependent and would run on it's own. And every skilled programmer or hacker would know that you would be able to hack the computer driven car to do what ever they wanted it to. Hackers can already hack a lot of vehicles as it is, they can send codes to a smart vehicle to unlock and even start the car without owning or having the key to the car. There are way too many dangerous things that could possibly happen with that to list. Hackers could change the course of the vehicle to any given location, they could make the car crash itslef, and they could make the car failt to alert the driver and every one would blame either the driver or the car.",

Not all teacher or staff can tell, but just looking at the students mouth or orbicularis tighten around their lips should show that they are angry or happy.

        "For many years, researchers have stared at the Mona Lisa. They have made countless observations and have even created this new technology that detects her emotions through facial recognition. Creator Prof. Thomas Huang has named this the Facial Action Coding System. This may not seem very important in the outside world, but the use of Facial Action Coding could be very beneficial in classrooms because it could understand the student's frustration and confusion and would modify the lesson to better fit the student, counselors could use it ot help determine how a student is truly feeling, and it would help teachers better understand the students who rarely talk in their class.\r\n\r\nFacial Action Coding could be benificial in classrooms because the technology could understand the student's frustration and confusion and modify the lesson to better fit the student. In schools all around, students are starting to give up. They get too angry at their homework and decide that they don't want to work on it anymore. The problems don't change--but with the Facial Action Coding System, the problems and even the lesson itself could change and become easier for the student. This would allow for the student to wrap their mind around the concept that was given to them. In the article, Dr. Huang states in paragraph 6, \"'A classroom computer could recognize when astudent is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'\" This quote tells its readers that that is what Dr. Huang wants this new technology to do. Teachers have to follow a guideline and a lesson plan; they have to be on track as to what the students are learning. Dealing with almost fifteen to twenty students a class, the teacher cannot physically help a student one-on-one all of the time. The Facial Action Coding System, however, would be able to.",
        "A computer reading your emotions? In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smila\" the author talks about how Facial Action Coding System is able to read emotions and how it may help students in the classroom. This technology in a classroom will not be beneficial because it is costly, may distract students, invades privacy, and may lead to ineffective learning.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 7 the author states \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile\". The average home PC's price ranges from about $200 USD to $500 USD. Since the average home computers can not handle these algorithms then the school must purchase higher end computers which will be very costly since every student will need one. Also every student travels throughout the school so the school must be able to purchase laptops with this advanced hardware and software so that the students will be able to use them in every class they attend.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 6 of the article the author states \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" and \"then it could modify the lesson\". When in a lesson at school not every student will enjoy the lesson, which will cause them to have a bored or even tiresome expression. Having this expression will cause the computer to attempt and make the lesson more intresting; but what if the student is still bored? The computer will keep trying to modify the lesson which could cause it to lead away from the original goal of the lesson so much that the student is no longer focused on the original topic.\r\n\r\nHaving a computer constantly reading your emotions will invade on your privacy. Paragraph 6 states \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" \"Then it could modify the lesson\". When detecting the student is bored or confused it will have to relay this information to the teacher letting them know that due to the student's emotion that it will be modifying the lesson to accomodate them. This means that when a student may be having a bad day or may just be in a bad mood that it will recognize that and store that information so that the teacher can know.",
        "Driverless cars should not be allowed in today's day and age because they are a safety hazard to not only the driver, but also to passengers and pedestrians. They are too much of an invitation to look at a cell phone or to get distracted by something else, such as a child in the back seat. They can cause wrecks and fatalities to skyrocket. Driving a vehicle is something that should be monitored at all times. When operating a vehicle, you must always be alert for not onlt your safety, but everyone else's.\r\n\r\nThe media has long been fascinated with vehicles that can drive themselves, but have they thougth out the idea entirely? Since 2009, Google has made cars that can drive independently under certain conditions. However, these cars are not totally driverless. They alert the driver when pulling in and out of driveways, driving through construction, traffic issues, and accidents. This can lead to distraction and not knowing what is going on around you. Adding to this, it can cause a leap in accidents and fatalities caused by these death machines.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, BMW announced their development of \"Traffic Jam Assisstant\". This is a vehicle that can drive on its own at speeds of up to 25 mph but has touch sensors to make sure the driver has his or her hands on the wheel. This shows that this car is only good for certain residential areas, and not highways or interstates where speed limits can reach up to 70 mph. Also, a driver can fall asleep at the wheel and not even realize it when it's time to be alert. This can cause major accidents in which legal battles can occur against manufacturers and individuals.\r\n\r\nAdding to issues above, some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. These diplays can be turned off when the driver takes the wheel, but this also allows drivers to get distracted and television instead of driving.",
        "Personally i am for driverless cars because with these cars if a accident were to ever occur the car would prevent it from happening which would prevent lots of deaths from texting and driveing from hit an runs. It would also keep the driver protected and also other drivers on the road protected. And also the sensors on the car modify when you are to close to a object or are going to hit a object before it is going to happen. And also the dubbed LIDAR use laser beams to form a constant updateing 3-D model of the car's surroundings with this combination the input is necessary for the driverless to mimic the real skill of a human at the wheel. And with the assistance and help of google the GPS his able to connect to google maps to navigate the driverless car to it's destination. With the sensors on and in the car drivers assistance isnt a problem, with the antilock brakes the is willing to stop when something is blocking it or is comeing at it with a equal speed. With more roadside assistance from google you can connect your cell phone to the car and answer the phone as you please and still be able to safely drive on the road.\r\n\r\nWith some of the assistance there is another added one its called \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but the special touch sensors makes sure the driver keeps hold of wheel. But not any of the cars made today so far has not accomplished makeing cars competely driverless they can break themselves, steer and also accelerate and all this tecnology keeps driver notified when on the road.\r\n\r\nThe car cant do all this on its on it needs human skill and assistance at the wheel along with it.",
        "Technology to read students emootions.\r\n\r\nI think that being able to read someone that way is really not okay. it sorta takes to personal space because there are reason these emmotions are not shown towards others and that normaly because nobody wants their feelings hurt or hurting sombody else. it doesnt feel good inside, being able to help sombody and help them keep there head up high and keep them walking tall.\r\n\r\nThe technology would be very interesting but i think it shoud only be used at certain times not to read what a student is feeling, use it on criminals and watch there change in mood threw there facial movements almost like a lie detector test. there is nothing in the article stateing the cons of this item its all about the pro's\r\n\r\nso i cannot really find much except to type what i think it should be used for. it would be some really great stuff if it ends up being used for the right thing t the right time so hope fully when somthings likes this happens they will use it wisely.",
        "Join the Seagoing program! The Seagoing Cowboys will be a great opportunity to have fun on the seas. You could go to different country's. I went to China and Europe. UURRA hired Seagoing cowboys to take care of young cattle,horses,and mules.\r\n\r\nI went on gondola in Italy and I took nine trips. That was the highest than any other Seagoing Cowboy. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you could beat my highscore. It might take long to go place to place but it is worth having fun on the boat so it doesn't get boring like that and this ain't where it ends. the fun doesn't stop here.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have fun going to different countrys. Then, have fun on board.\r\n\r\nMake up tournaments while you are going to a different place play different games like baseball, volleyball, and much more to do on board. Then, relax and read a book and sleep or take a nap and feed the animals and keep them clean so they don't be stinky and filfty. Keep yourself occupied and do something so you don't get bored and quit.\r\n\r\nThere are so many reasons to become a Cowboy. For starters, if you don't know how to do what a Cowboy does watch from other Cowboys or ask for help.",
        "Imagine what it would be like to drive past a car with no driver. The thought of driverless cars is really something to think about. But after reading the article, its clear that even though it shows some good qualities, driverless cars should not be an invention we soon incopperate into our daily lives.\r\n\r\nIn the article, the author makes some good points about some of the cons of driverless cars. Such as, the need for new traffic laws, accidents and the safety of the pedestrians and drivers of other vehicles. As of right now, the traffic laws are written under the assumption that a car is only a safe car if it has a human driver controlling it at all times, which makes it illegal in most states to even test cars that are run by computers.\r\n\r\nThe safety of these driverless cars is concerning as well. They do have many cameras and sensors as the article points out, but technology has not be perfected yet, so the sensors or cameras failing is a possible outcome of these cars. Then, a failed system in these cars could cause an accident. This comprimises the safety of other drivers and even pedestrians. Then, if a person is harmed in an accident with a driverless car, who is to blame? We have to make new laws just for the purpose of having driverless cars when we could just drive our own cars.\r\n\r\nAlso, a downfall of driverless cars is that people lose jobs. Driving services would no longer need human drivers to control the cars. This puts thousands of people out of jobs which raises the unemployment rate. Which then causes the government to need to give more money to support families becasue now someone from the family isnt bringing in money because they lost their job due to the driverless cars now transporting people instead of driving services using humans.",
        "I think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think you should becuase you get to visit places that you might never get to go to in life or to see things that you may no get a chance to witness.\r\n\r\nFor example in text, Luke found as much time as he can to have as much fun. Him and his cowboy friends played baseball, vollyball games, etc. They also had some tournaments, like fencing, boxing, reading whatever they can think of to pass time.\r\n\r\nSome more infomation from the article is The boat ride was fun and they had chances of seeing countrys like Europe and China and Greece. They took gondala rides in Venice, Italy, In the streets with water. If I was there i would enjoy myself more than other. Even in after the war in Europe was over left in ash and all they still went to the cities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion this shows that you should participate in alot of things, Because you will never kniw what will come your way.

        "I would have to say that I am in favor of moving forward and progressing towards driverless cars. There are quite a few reasons why I believe it's a great idea. After the idea is perfected, roads will be much safer, The cost of transportation will go down and also it could possibly make transporting on roads much faster.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this \"driverless car\" is quite astonishing, but once it is perfected it will open up doors to new oppurtunities in transporting on roads. For example, the car would be able to sense cars that a human could possibly not see. This would make the amount of car accidents go down.\r\n\r\nAlso, some states have already allowed computer driven cars on the road, as it says in the passage. This demonstates that these driverless cars are becoming safer everyday. It also says in the article that manufacturers believe the number of states to allow driverless cars is only going to continue rising as they advance there search for safer and possibly cheaper cars or solutions.\r\n\r\nOne other reason that i believe that these cars are a great idea is because it says that the cars can make for cheaper transportation. For example, it states in the article that Sergey Brin, cofounder of google, believes that the fuel amount needed in these futuristic cars will be half of what we use today. We would be able to do less harm to the environment by using less fuel. Also, Sergey Brin states that taxis would be more flexible and safe.",

        "Some people believe that this landform is an alien signal. Sure, it might look like one. That still doesent that it is one.\r\n\r\nThis object in space is just another accidental landform that happened to form there. There are not any alien landforms. There is no actual proof that the aliens have built this structure. Many strange occurances happen. This just happened to be one of them.\r\n\r\nThis is a common thing that occurs on mars. This is just a coincidence that it happened to look like it was an egyptian person. Up close this big rock is just a plain rock. It is just the sun shining on it that makes it look like it is a face. Thats all that it is.\r\n\r\nWithin our article on passage 9 it says that it was super hard to find this one. So that means that there is not that many of this oddly shaped landform. If you really think about it if there were really aliens there they would build more than just one.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be more proof that the aliens built that. This is also common on earth. Some people say that they can see a celebritty in there food. Really it is just some bad shaped food item.\r\n\r\nWe just need some cold hard proof of it. For us it just looks like a big rock that has been there forever.",
        "This Facial Action Coding System is weird. Why would anyone want to know what someone else is feeling or how their emotions are? To me that is personal information that I would want to myself. Plus I doubt that there would be a whoe lot a people who would put money into this to just see what emotion they are. That is just me though. What do you think about this idea? Would you spend time and money on it to just see your emotions and what mood you were in? I wouldn't.\r\n\r\nIf you keep reading from now on I am going to argue why this is a bad idea, because it is. I mean who would spend any type of time, effort, or money on this just to see what your emotions are or how you are feeling. Honestly who wants to know what facial expressions to use to show that you are happy, I think we already know how to be happy. We dont need a machine to tell us how to look happy. Obviously when someone is happy something great has happened to them or in their lives and they have a great big smile on their face. We also know when someone is mad, obviously when someone is mad they don't like to talk very much, and usually look like they are about to punch you in the face. For example in the text it shows you step by step what expression on your face we need to use to make us look happy, like no I know how to look happy or sad or mad, I don't need a machine to tell me how to do that.\r\n\r\nSo why do we need a machine to tell us these things when we already know them.

        "Students can feel various different types of emotions throughout the school day. School can be very stressful and overwhelming yet so enjoyable at the same time. When students are feeling a certain way, it may affect their ablity to learn. By incorporating the use of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom, teachers or even the computers themsleves could alter the learning style of the information being taught, making it customized and fitting for a specific student based on their emotions.\r\n\r\nEveryone is different when it comes to learning. Some students may be visual learners where as some students may be auditory learners. There are numerous, unique differences spanning from individual to indivdual which makes it hard on teachers when trying to teach a group of students the same material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System would make the job easier on teachers and prove helpful for students. For example, if a teacher could not visually recognize that one of thier students was tired, they may continue on with the way they are teaching the information, and that particular student may not grasp the concept being taught. With the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher would be able to recognize the students emotions and would have the opprotunity to alter her teaching method to somehting more engaging for the student. This would also prove helpful for the student that was feeling tired becasue they would now be able to become engaged with a modified style of learning.\r\n\r\nIf the Facial Action Coding System recognized that the students appeared to be happy and engaged, this could guide the teacher to continue teaching in that particular style and it would benefit the students trying to learn. Another way that this new technology could prove valuble in the classroom is if students were doing work on their computer or other elctronic device. If the Facial Action Coding System was installed into the learning devices that the students are using, the device itself could alter the learning style of the information given to fit the students needs.",

        "So you believe that the face on Mars was alien made. There are very many people that belive it is alien made to. There are also many people that believe it is not alien made. I believe that it is not alien made. I believe that the \"face\" is actually a natural landform.\r\n\r\nI believe that it is a natural landform because it is said that it looks like another landform on Earth. It is also shown on the pictures that NASA astronuats have taking that it is not alien made. The shadows have made the landforms craters look like facial features. There wasn't any proof of alien life on the face just theories made by consumers.\r\n\r\nPeople who believe it was made by aliens say that for many reason. The first reason is that hte first picture showed what look like a face staring back at you. Sencond reason is because they believe that we are trying to hide something from them. Also people want something to believe even if it doesn't have any realistic evidence. Last but not least the theory that aliens are out there has been around for ages so it wouldn't be wrong for them to believe that aliens did it.\r\n\r\nIt may look that way in the past but only because the images we captured then were not as inhansed as the ones now. The first photograph, made from the Viking 1, may have give the illusion that it was a face. Now that our technology is now modified we can see that is was just a landform.",
        "Using the same technology configured using the Facial Action Coding System into school technology would be a valuable tool in the classroom because the often hidden signals or vibes students show can often give teachers mixed feelings about the effectiveness of their lessons or how student are being treated emotionally by others, but this is still something that we must not make this something that interfears or plays with the personal feelings of the students. It would be a valuable addition to any classroom for its in-depth look into how the information is reaching the students, how they are reacting, and what the teacher can do differently to get the most out of thier lesson plans.\r\n\r\nEspecially in the mornings and end of the day, students' laziness, tiredness, or anticipation to get home can often disturb with how teachers percieve how their lesson plans are effecting the child. With the same Facial Action Coding System in our own school computers, online activities and assignments can track the emotional responses of the students while they work such as their attentiveness. Since this technology is, \"compared against a neutral face\", teachers will be able to witness firsthand their student's reactions. Oftentimes, early morning weariness or late school day excitement can fool the teacher's perception of the situation, but with the analyzing of the six basic emotions using \"video imagery\" of the, \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\", this technology would be able to offer to give an accurate conclusion to the student's reactions to each lesson.\r\n\r\nAnother commonly addressed situation is when students become \"confused or board\" with an assignment; both of these natural reactions show that the challenge level is not suited to the student's level. Teachers often want to offer help to the confused and challenge or entice board students, but these emotions are often not shown to the human eye. Especially with confused students, they hide this sense of confusion from the teacher to avoid embarassment. However, with this new technology, students who need more attention can be noticed. With the software's facial recogntion using minor muscle movements, it can make a conclusion without the student fully showing the emotion. With this in depth look, teachers are able to provide tutoring for those who need extra explaination and modify of their lessons for individuals who are not finding interest or challenge in the current lesson. With this technology, teachers will be able to realize how challenged each student needs to be even when they put up a ficade.",

We would like you to be our newest Seagoing Cowboy. After your first trip you might even want to invite your friends to become a Cowboy too.\r\n\r\nSeagoing Cowboys see new places, because of the work that they do. They must take food, animals, and supplies to countries who can not grow and thrive after tragic accidents. In the passage Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist become Seagoing Cowboys and work together on a boat traveling to Europe. In Europe the people had just fought in World War II and had no food or supplies, not even animals. So the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration sent supplies and animals on a ship to help the people in Europe.\r\n\r\nSeagoing Cowboys learn responsiblity by taking care of the animals and crew members on board their ship. In the article Luke must take care of horses, young cows, and mules by giving them water and food, cleaning the pens, and pulling hay and supplies from the lower decks. Seagoing Cowboys not only take care of animals they have to watch out for one another. In the passage Luke was almost knocked overvoard but thankfully a strip of metal caught him and his crewmates pulled him back aboard.\r\n\r\nThe people who do sign up to become Seagoing Cowboys get to travel around the world and learn about new cultures, eat new and interesting foods, and even get to see amazing landscapes and structures.

        "Have you seen the \"Face on Mars\"? If so, do you believe it is natural or created by alien activity? Many people believe the face is evidence of alien life however this is probably not the case. The Mars Global Surveyor ,a mapping spacecraft, has passed over the area few times. However the few times it has passed over there has been no evidence of any form of alien civilization. This led us to believe it is just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nThis all began when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting Mars. Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible landing sites for his sibling Viking 2. In the midst of doing so Viking 1 spotted what looked like a human face. This was extraordinary because it was on planet Mars! When the images were leaked it led the public to believe that this is evidence of life outside of Earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis might not be the case however. NASA believes that the face is just a natural landform similiar to a butte or mesa on that of Earth. There was a lot more evidence pointing towards the side of NASA but that didn't put peoples hopes down. Some of the public hoped and believed this was in some shape or form, evidence of extraterrestriel life.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of the \"Face on Mars\" that NASA had were actually kind of foggy. They were foggy because the Mars Global Surveyor had to get the photos through clouds. This then led people to believe that NASA was hiding something in the fog. They thought they were hiding the evidence of life. NASA, however wanted to show them this was not the case.\r\n\r\nNASA then ,a few years later, passed over the face on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, and rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. NASA eventually captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. This photo cleared up a lot of confusion.\r\n\r\nAs NASA studied the photograph, they came to realize that the Face was in fact caused by natural means. They then leaked the image to the public and cleared up confusion there too.",

The FACS would also help understand how the student is feeling in the classroom. It could aslo help in many ways by understanding how the students feel about like a lesson that is given or feel throughout the whole classroom time.

        "My years a Seagoing Cowboy was a great time. Not only did I do it with one of my best friends, I got to experince something that comes once in a life time. Also, I had many different experinces out of the United States. Finally, I was kept from going to serve in the military. I for one was a little excited about that.\r\n\r\nLike I said, for a small town boy like me, sailing around the world is an opprotunity of a life time. There was no way I was going to turn down something like that. On my first trip I turned 18 years old and as you probably know, I would have had to join the military. But, they made an exeption due to the fact that I was already involved with the Seagoing Cowboys. Again, there was know way I would take serving in the military over sailing around the world. Another reason why I think that anyone should tryout the Seagoing Cowboys program is because, I had the opprotunity to see many different cultures or ways of life. Once, I got to go on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece. Finally, I got to see many parts of China.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Seagoing Cowboys program, I have gained knowledge about Europe and China. Now, I hope that you will go and enjoy it too.",
        "After reading the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" I have been asked to tell weather or not i think the author did a good job supporting and evaluating his ideas. As i read through the text i looked for key moments that stood out. This author beleives it is right and just to continue our missions to try and explore our neighboring planet. I feel that he does a very good job backing up his statement because he has an interesting introduction, middle and end. The author also does a very good job explaining his theory through lots of detail and background. Finally, the author doesnt just use his knowledge but he goes out there and finds information from experts. To me, those are three componets that will really prove what you believe in.\r\n\r\nThe article starts out with some basic background information to get you hooked onto the topic. It reads, \"IN our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point from earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.\" those few sentences hook the reader on their claim and make you want the author to prove him self. therefore, the author does exactly that throughout the body of the text. He gives detail, background and outside sources but, we'll get into that later. In the end, he raps up the text with his claim once a again and that final kicker that get any strageling readers that dont quite believe him. It states, \"Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the body the author illustrates textbook detailing and informing.",
        "I beileve the tecnology of \"Driverless\" cars is necessary in todays society, and should be used for its worth. One of the few big ideas i saw in the article was the newer use of sensors in the vehicles we use today. Many of the sensors today are used to warn and stop the driver from any collisions or accidents that may accure, at any moment. I beileve that this technology is needed now more than ever for everyone, and not just unexperienced or handicaped drivers. I am currently still learning how to drive and will get my license very, and i am very cautious of my peers driving too. I would feel more comfortable that the car could stop itself wiith out the drivers noticing, and possibly stoping to stop a collision or save my very own life. I would very much like to see this technology come to fruition, and let the world harness it's abilities to further mankind towards a safer and better future.\r\n\r\nThe laws aginst the use of these \"Driverless\" cars are very reasonable too, and need to adjust for further research towards the safety of the people they aim to protect with these laws. I beileve they dont realize that testing and researching these new methods is a step foward, for safety, and not for just the sake of testing variables on somethings. They don't seem to understand that these technologies are being invented to help save people today. If you searched on the internet for just one second you could find all sorts of stories, about their own cars saving the drivers from creating a terrible mistake and saving their lives. These laws make me question us, as a society, more than ever, and as a society how are we allowed to grow in knowledge and sciences, if we cannot test our ideas? We must further sucome to the new technologies we have available, at this time, but we must not lose ourselves in context. We have to push towards breaking these laws aginst testing and accept the new technology, for the future.\r\n\r\nAs a child i watched cartoons with flying cars and cities in space, and in todays age we have the ability to strive for this dream of the future. One day I hope to be sitting in a cab that s driving itself perfectly fine and not releasing large amounts of toxins into the air that we all breath, to survive. This is yet another thing to admire of these \"driverless\" cars, and that is the ability to use much less amounts of fuel, rather than traditional vehicles.",
        "I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. Another big reason is that we really don't know just how much computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad.\r\n\r\nPerforming this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions. New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code. Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units. We really don't know how much the computer can do, it can detect if you're happy or sad, and make computer-animated faces.\r\n\r\nIn a whole, this is a lot to disagree with, since computers are taking over our world now so I believe this is a great idea.",

And if we never took those last photos what would of happen to this research project.\r\n\r\nAs they told us in the story that this as probably just a huge rock formation with shadow giving it the facial feautures to make it look like a person. Some people stil dont belive NASA that that is what it is, they think alliens created that.

        "There are positive and negative aspects of a driverless car. Some people might love the idea on the other hand other people might not. I believe driverless cars are the future, and there going to come up with some very smart cars in the near future.\r\n\r\nI believe that driverles cars are a genius idea because you can do anything while the car is driving. Well of course not everything you don't want to be sleeping and the car crashes onto something because it doesn't detect it. Many people run late in the morning on there way to work or school or wherever they might go and maybe didn't have time for breakfest or didn't finish getting ready\r\n\r\nI believe that you can do that stuff while the car is in motion. Even though you need a driver there in the car \"Tesla is going to release a car capable of driving on autopilot ninety percent of the time\" which means you'll only be driving that ten percent which isn't alot. Yes I do believe the safety of one another is very important but I think the manufactures wouldn't release a car if they knew it wasn't capable of doing the things that the manufactures promised.",
        "People have been debating if the use of new technology should be used in the classroom; however, people have yet to decide. There are two sides to this arugment the pro side. The people who want the use of new technology and then there are them who think newer technology is not needed to learn. These people are the con side. The author Nick D'Alto made great points on how new facal technology could be helpful in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe first way, new facal technology could help in the classroom is by showing when a student is confused and not sure whats going on. In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states \" A classroom computer can recognoze when a student is becoming confused or cored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" As for example, of this when doing math homework online or english the computor could recoginize when the student is confused and then send the student step-by-step insturction. Also the teacher could request this imfomation on which problem the students are confused on and go over them into more detailed.\r\n\r\nThe second reason, as to why we should use facial technology is for students who are intrested into coding and computer-animations. Students can learn how to make video games charactaers more expressive. As in paragraph 6, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video suregery\" This could help when student is taking and computer-animation class and is very intrested into becoming an coder. When making these games the more detail and expresstion the animators can put into these games the more infomation they need. This program can help provide that kind of knowleage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, yes this new facial technology is not nessary. People often say teacher can read their students facial expersstions just fine without technology; however, an teacher might just over look it or not be able to tell what the student is feeling.",

        "A new computer software designed by Thomas Huang can detect emotions just by scanning the face. Everyday, many people hide their emotions, but with this new software, even the slightest bit of discomfort or anguish can be recognized. In classrooms, this innovation will be useful for many reasons.\r\n\r\nFor many years, students have been confused in the classroom or too afraid to ask questions about a particular subject. However, this new software can detect when a student is confused,thus making the lesson easier for the student to understand. The text states that the classroom computer can also recognize when a student is becoming bored, also modifying the lesson to become more entertaining.\r\n\r\nAlthough this new software is groundbreaking, it may have some negative effects. For instance, teachers and professors may lose their jobs as students will no longer feel the need to ask questions. Schools may start to replace teachers with more computers with this software, therefore causing a lesser demand for teachers. Although this may not happen for a while, this concept should still be worrisome and also brought forward.\r\n\r\nThis new innovation, however, should be used more and more everyday for the results are truly remarkeable. Students will no longer be confused or bored in class, and certain ads can be changed to a preference. Video games and other media can also be more enjoyable.",

Some of you would like to pay attention to the streets or what not. It does not matter if you dont like space or planets but if you thinking about it, then now is the time to learn about the planet Venus. In the excerpt, the author explains that Venus is sometimes called the \u00a8Evening Star.\u00a8 This something that you will be shocked about because I wouldve never known. He also explains that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He explains the idea very well because want to welcome many people to study the world to see whats its like to know when something is gonna happen or how its gonna happen.\r\n\r\nSometimes studying things can be real helpful because you can learn so many things about it. The article states, \u00a8These differences in the speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times we are closer to\r\n\r\nVenus.\u00a8 This indicate that anything could happen if we touch one of those planets. He addresses the speed in the planets when it orbits the sun. Anything can go wrong if its always going like that. Its like having something spinning around everyday. Eventually, something is gonna go wrong and its gonna mess everything up. On the other hand, People who study space would know the answer to what will happen if they was to touch.

Would you feel like your privacy was invaded? Would you feel judged? I know I personally would feel threatened and exposed. I beleive that the\r\n\r\nFacial Action Coding System, a computer program that can identify human emotions, would have no value in a classrom because, it has no practical use in a learning enviorment such as a classroom, it would be an invasion of students privacy, and while it may not be of use in a calssroom, it could be put to use in other fields of work.\r\n\r\nI think that this emotion identifing technology would have no practical use in a learning classroom enviorment becasuse teachers have to ensure the material is digested by students no matter what emotinal state they are in. While recogonizing a students emotions could expalin why they may be uninterested in the material it does not change the fact that they still must learn it if they want to further their own education. Therfore, I beleive that this technology would be of no use to both the student and the teacher.\r\n\r\nI also beleive that this technology would have no practical use or value in a classroom due to its nature, its a blatant invasion of privacy.

        "Driverless cars are somethign that has become athign in the last couple of years. This brought great contorversy on whether it is neccessary or if it is plain idiotic. Some people belive that there is no point in a driverless car because it's not technically driverless at this point, it still needs a driver to drive for certain things. I however believe driverless cars is a great idea here is why.\r\n\r\nA driverless car cuts back on gas nearly by half and this is great al around. Gas fumes cause pollution especially with nearly everyone beign a motorist in this day and age; more cars are on the street whihc adds up to more fumes. The gas fumes cut throught the ozone which is very important to the biosphere. Without the ozone layer the air quality will plummit. So if there is a small chance that a driverless car can cut back n gas that;s a great idea. Not only will this cut back on pollution it will cut back on gas prices. Gas prices have steadily increasing over the years and this had put a dent in your pocket. Many people work hard for their money, and a fraction of that goes to your car for gas. So driverless cars are beginning to sound a lot better in these aspects, but how about the overall effect of them.\r\n\r\nIs a driverless car actually driving or assisting you? I believe it is assisting you, which isn't entirely bad. Especillay if you are a new driver it takes some of the pressure off of you as you try adn advance your driving skills. Driverless cars can,\" Steer, accelerate,and brake themselves, but notify thre driver when the road ahead requires human skills.\" If the driver's attention is needed, GM has developed seat that vibrate when the vehicle is\r\n\r\nin danger of backing into an object. Google has a car that announces when the driver is needed.\r\n\r\nThe people and comapnies that develop these cars are keeping safety in mind which leads to a happier consimer.",

It read Mona Lisa smile symply from a computer software and tells what percentage of their emotion she is in. According to the article this can give you any details of a person in paragraph 6 \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confured or bored.\" I actually think that is smart because any you cant see when a person is sad but they have a smile in their face. It tells you how they are feeling that exact time.\r\n\r\nFor instance humans perform the same emotion everyday either if you are happy or sad. In the article it says that they are \"44 muscles just like human muscles\" that can tell your emotion and the percentage of ur emotion. Sometimes they compared it to a real a nuetral face to see the difference.",

Dr. Huang predicts. \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"\r\n\r\nYou can't\r\n\r\nprobably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

        "Driverless cars seem like they would take over the future in about the next twenty years. When in reality technology is not pregressing as quickly as you think.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars would cause chaos in the world. Causing problems the car salesman would not even mention to you. Heres why they would be bad for society.\r\n\r\nWhen people think of this idea of driverless cars they think finally the future has come upon us for once and for all. As stated in the article driverless cars could malfunction and legally the manufacturer would be to blame.All drivers would have to take caution and be aware of there surroundings everywhere they went. Drivers everywhere would have to be alert and furthermore, know that everytime they get into there driverless vehichle that there are risks. The accidents are just one factor there are many others.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are said to have a feature where the human or driver is alerted to know when to take over. This feature on the car could not be as safe as we are blinded to believe. What if the car does not alert the person fast enough.In that case that would cause lots of problems for everyone who has a driverless cars. I learned from the article that the car does not know how to avoid traffic stops or work zones. That would mean the driver would have to step up and take over for the time being. The article states that they are still working on the type of signaling that it would want to include. I'm sure they would try to find the safest one possible. On a 55 mph freeway would the driver be alerted fast enough to take over ? This question troubles me because what if the vehicle does not stop and the person ignores the signaling.",
        "For many people, including myself, we have days when we are happy, optomistic, and just in a good mood for whatever reason. Then we have days where are sad, pesemistic and overall just in a bad mood.\r\n\r\nOn paragraph eight of this paasage it states that faces don't lie. while I do think that is true I do not think we are at a point where this technology can be accurate enough for us to be able to determine our emotions. Although I do not think it is accurate right now I do believe that in the future technology will able to accurately read our faces and find our emotions and this article shows why and how it is possible.\r\n\r\nThe first way that this passage shows us how emotion reading is possible is by bringing us an example in paragraph one of the Mona Lisa. The paragraph says that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This example right here is meant to show us how the technology can work but brings us more questions that we hopfully get answers for. In paragraph three lots of backround information is given to us so that we can get an idea on how they were able to determine what the emotions of the girl in painting are. the author talks about the main emotions humans show and how technology can now allow us to mimick the muscles that humans have in their face and the movments they can make. In paragraph four the author elaborates a bit more on the technology and how it can be used to search for those mixed emotions. The author cites quotes from Dr. Huang, one of the main people behind the project, in order to give insight to the readers who may not fully belive that reading emotions through technology is possible.",
        "There is a new technology called Facial Action Coding System. This Coding System can identify your emotions. Dr. Paul Eckamn has been classifiying six emotions.\" Eckamn has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.\" \"-Then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\"\r\n\r\nThey have started useing this technology in schools now. \"A classroom computer could recognize when a studen is becoming confused or bored.\" \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" After reading this information from the article, I think we should have this type of technology in school. It could really help the kids who do not talk to their teacher at all. But there is also a downfall of useing this type of technology.\r\n\r\nSome of the bad things that could happen is the computer misreading the kid wrong. Therefore, giving him wrong information about what ever he is learning about. It is also very expensive. The worst thing that could happen is the teachers who went to school their whole life trying to become a teacher, they are now jobless. What is the point of paying somebody to teach a student when there is now a computer in their school to do it. That is one of the major negative things from this technology.\r\n\r\nSome of the good things that could happen is the student actually learning. There are many students who just sit in the back of the class not talking, but when a computer can do it for them they will probably learn a lot more. They don't have to say one word because when the computer feels that you are sad/happy it would change the subject.\"For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.",
        "There are many people that love driving for the fun of it or for family bonding or even friendly bonding. There are companies that want to start making driverless cars so that we don't have to drive and I don't think that should happen because obesity and laziness is a huge problem in america already, these cars I believe are unsafe, and I don't think the laws will even allow this. Driverless cars should'nt be made and in these paragraphs I will tell you why.\r\n\r\nThe first reason I have is that obesity and laziness is already a huge problem in America. I have read many articles and heard many stories on the news about America being obese. If these cars are made this will only add to the problem and I say that because if people don't have to drive anymore then most will go home and sit on the couch to watch some tv. And when doing that they usually have a bite to eat while doing it. When driving you have to walk out to the car, move your foot when your driving, move your hands to steer, and also get out the car and walk to where your going. These are all ways of getting some type of excercise. The world needs it's excercise.\r\n\r\nThe second reason I have is that it appears to be unsafe. In the article it states that, \" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--- the driver or the manufaturer?\". This is why I think it is unsafe if the car as some type of disfunction or mishap while on the road with other human controlled cars it could hurt someone really bad or maybe even kill a person.",

The author describes the similarities of Venus and Earth, provides solutions to living on Venus, and expresses how researching Venus would be an advancement of the human mind.\r\n\r\nThe author supports their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit despite its dangers, by suggesting that Venus may have once been similar to Earth. The author wrote in paragraph 4, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" By suggesting that Venus could have some answers to Earth's climate, the author provides strong support to their claim. The text also states in paragraph 4, \"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" The author goes on to describe how Earth and Venus may have been closely related long ago. It is also mentioned that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit, which is beneficial considering the how long space travel takes. The author's claim is supported through this evidence of Venus being Earth-like at one point in time.\r\n\r\nAnother way that the author suppprts their claim is by providing some solutions to studying Venus, despite the dangers it possesses. The author writes in paragraph 5, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.\" In paragraph 5, the author continues to explain how the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not go over the radiation levels on Earth. The solution that the author suggests helps support their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit by giving direct evidence as to how researchers may go about doing this.",

It tell you about tells you about all the grater thing that they can do and even the not so greater outcomes that can come from a driverless car.\r\n\r\nMy position with driverless cars is that I think they will be a great idea because it gives humans a better chance at looking out for thing that might potically can get them into a car accident. \" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on idividual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better repsonse and control than a human driver could manage alone.\" The driverless cars can protect you than you can protect yourself and anyone else in the car with you. The driverless car can even handle any driving functions up to the speeds of 25mph. The cars are designed to let the driver know when there is accident ahead of when there is road constrution going on so it tells the humans to take control because the car knows that it can't do it by itself. \" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves,but all are esigned to notify the driver when the road ahead requries human skills,... navigating through work zones and aroung accidents.\" The car can a geart thing that happens to the world.\r\n\r\nThe driveless car has been around for as couple of years.

It is a good idea because in the article it says that the drivers will get an alert to when they have to take control over the wheel. In paragraph 5 it states \"Special touch sensors make sure the drivers keep hold of the wheel.\" The car isnt dangerous or anything. The car will be safe and smart. In paragraph 2 it says that \"Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.\" maybe we could reduce the amount of car crashes per year.\r\n\r\nYes , there is some negative results but what are the chances? People want a safer car and about half of the world will accept the Driverless Cars. It has more positives results than negative. \"Sensing the World\"? the cars have sensors that detect a problem around the car. In this article it said that sensors arent new. Sensors should be a problem to the people since they have been out. Also in the article it says \" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\"",
        "In 1976, a Mars Global Surveyor snapped pictures of what is known as the \"Face on Mars.\" It is a natural landformation and is visible becuase of the pictures shown, the internet, and the area the landform is located.\r\n\r\nFirst, the pictures show the \"face.\" In 1976, the pixels were 43m (meters) per pixel. In 2001, the pixels were only 1.56m per pixel. The quality is worse the bigger the pixels.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, the quality of the pixels were clear enough to show that the \"face\" was only a lanform. In the picture of 1976, it is visible that the picture is blurry. In the picture of 1998, the picture is less blurry, but still hard to see. In the 2001 picturer, the picture is very visible and well seen. At the bottom of the mesa, it is also visible to see the lanform has a rounded, smooth, almost non man-made surface that buried the landform into the planet side.\r\n\r\nNext, the Internet, showed what the scientists and the picters showed. A landform.\r\n\r\nIn the text, it states that when the picture was taken in 1998, it was the cloudy time of theyear on the red planet.\r\n\r\nFinally, where the \"face\" is located. The face is located in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.\r\n\r\nIn the article, it states that \"The sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah.\" Although the NASA researchers have concluded the \"face\" to be a natural landform, many are not satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nMany people claim that it was built by aliens, however, pictures do not lie.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the \"Face on Mars\" is really a mystery.",

Venus is the closest planet to Earth and people can not land on its surface for long because it is very different, as in the way it orbits the sun or how the clouds are corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" suggest that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is so close to earth and share similar traits with each other, the author wants this challenge to be conquered, and for the experience to be a learning insight.\r\n\r\nFirst, the author states that Venus is referred to as Earth's \"twin\" because of their close proximity, density and size. This is a way that the author supports the idea because it should be a way that humans can reach this planet and study it. Also, because Venus is thought to be the most Earth like planet in the solar system. Ideas should be created in order to reach the limits of Venus.\r\n\r\nThen, the author supports the idea with the statistic of how spaceships has not been able to touch Venus in more than three decades. As said in the article, \"the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?\"(paragraph 4) If the challenge can be conquered of landing on Venus safely, Astronomers can gather so much insight that could also lead to other big things being conquered.\r\n\r\nLastly, the author supports the idea with the knowledge that can be gained from the experience. There has already been an idea of how humans will get to Venus, \" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.",

Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, would agree. \"He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world.\" With such new and brilliant technology, drivers will be able to sit back and watch as the car drives them. Some new cars have cameras and multiple different types of sensors. This gives drivers a full car body view of what is going on around the car. This technology will bring a new sense of safeness to passengers.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Google had already started inventing and testing a car that was able to drive independently \"under specific conditions.\" It has been said that this and other models of the car were able to drive over half a million miles without getting into a car accident. However, these cars are not yet completely driver-free. Certain situations such as pulling in and out of a driveway, and dealing with complicated road traffic require human assistance. The Toyota Prius was modified by Google, and on the car, sensors and cameras were implanted. The \"dubbed LIDAR\" \"uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.\" This allows drivers to get a 360 view of what is around them, and the feel of being more safe will be implemented.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" produced by BMW, was able to withstand speeds of 25 mph and below, but required human touch on the steereing wheel.",

Having a computer read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom can be both effective, and ineffective for several different reasons. Some of these reasons may include: emotional state, lesson planning, facial structure, critical thinking, puberty, and more.\r\n\r\nThe emotional state of most kids in school can vary on a day to day basis. Not every kid is always happy, and not every kid is always sad. By having a computer that can read and detect emotions, people might not feel the need to try and read each other's emotion. This would lessen their contact with their peers and lessen their ability to comprehending and understand other people's emotions and situations. Teachers might also worry if they detect that a student is sad, or angry.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, having a machine that can detect emotions may be helpful to some students. As stated in the article, If most, or all, of the class is confused, this machine would help the teacher detect the confusion and help him or her explain in a way that the student's can understand. \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" In this quote, we see how this computer could help adapt a better lesson plan for confused or uninterested students. If a student is depressed, anxious, or something of the like; the teacher can pull them off to the side and send them to a counselor to talk about it and help them feel better. However, we may wonder if the student is actually feeling this way.\r\n\r\nIf a technology like this is used, it will obviously have loads of coding in it. Sometimes there can be flaws in coding, or someone that can hack into it and change it. To have such a sensitive thing in a classroom may be dangerous for some students. Another point is that not everyone has the same facial structure. Some people even have deformities or problems that make their appearance different than other people's.",
        "There is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. It can be used to capture images of a person's face and decide if that person is happy, sad, etc. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the autor talks about how \"A classroom computer could reconginze when a student is becomeing confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This could be valuable in some cases, but in most, it won't be of any help.\r\n\r\nThe main reason that this new technoogy won't work is that there are multiple people in a class. Different students can have different emotions about a certain topic in school. For example, if a teacher is teaching math, 5 kids might think that what they are learing is really cool and interesting but, 10 other kids might think that math is dull and irritating.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may be times where there is only one kid in a classroom, like explained in paragraph 6. In this case you can change the lesson. When there is 30 to 50 kids in a class, how can you change a whole lesson just because a fraction of the students thinks it's boring? It would be really unfair to the majority of the kids who currently like the lesson plan. You also can't teach some kids one lesson, then the other kids a different lesson. It won't be the same and this can put a lot of stress on the teachers that have to teach and grade the lessons.\r\n\r\nThere is a way that the FACS could work.",
        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The text states many facts and statistics; therefore, the author supports this idea well, for he/she describes why astronomers are amazed by Venus, what NASA is planning on approaching the planet, and explaining the type of challenge it is to explore this dangerous \"Evening Star.\" Reading the passage, the author is convincing about the subject that he/she has chosen.\r\n\r\nThe planet, Venus, is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, as the author suggests. Supporting this idea, the author shows many examples, facts, and ideas why he/she thinks Venus is a worthy planet to keep studying, for the text states, \"Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.\" The writer describes that important studies come out of exploring Venus's reputation, even though it is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author supports the claim that Venus has many thrilling factors in Paragraph 3. Paragraph 3, Line 6 states, \"Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface.\" The author demonstrates his knowledge telling the readers that Venus cause many disasterous events that happen all around the world.\r\n\r\nAs the author claims that Venus is worth studying for, Paragraphs 4 through 7 shows evidence about scientists still studying Venus as of today and why geologists and atronomers are so fascinated with the blazing planet. In Paragraph 4, Line 2 states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" Scientists state that even today, Venus has features that look like mountains, as read in the passage. Testing his knowledge in the prompt, the author demonstrates that NASA wants to make visiting Venus possible. Throughout Paragraphs 5 through 7, it states what NASA's (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) plan is to successfully observing Venus from a up-close point of view. In Paragraph 5, Line 2 and 3 state, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.\" As being stated as a \"possible solution,\" the author shows NASA's solution is not an effecient plan, for Paragraph 6, Lines 1 through 4 state, \"However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.",
        "This article for me is kind of hard to believe. These people have never been up there to see this face on the red planet. Instead of sending a person up there to actually see it they send a machine to Mars to capture pictures of this face.\r\n\r\nScientist believe that this face is remains of alien structure but, do they have proof that aliens even exist? If they could get a picture of the face then why could they not get a picture of the aliens that were up there to die and have this face on face of Mars. This photo could just be a regular bump on the surface and the way the lighting is might make it look kind of like a face but, they have not yet to send anyone up there so they do not know for sure. If they really think that this is a face then they should send someone up there to capture a legit photo that is close up to prve that this face is really there. The face does not even look like a deformed creature it looks like a humans face and that is another thing that makes me not believe it. The scientist said that this face is a remain of an alien artifact but, if this is an alien than people might as well just start calling themselves aliens and aliens humans. If you look on the right side of the face you can not see anything but the shadow.",
        "The Facial Action Coding Sytem is not valuable in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the the introduction say, \"New sofware has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others.\" I say this because techology can make mistskes such as a computer that can read your emotions through your face and can have an accurate result. For example you might think an person who is happy by showing a smile but is the person really happy behind that smile with hidden emotions. It's not only one person there are others too who hide their emotions.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 5 says, \"For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actuallly describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convry specific emotions.\" I can somewhat agree because he is right about the fact that it's hard describing a facial expreesion that includes surprised or sad.\r\n\r\nThis shows that we dont need this type technology to show other people how we feel if they accurate.",
        "Do you think that the \"Face on Mars\" is not a real face but just a natural landform? Well, we think it is just a naural landform because when the first image appeared on JPL web site, it rereal that it's just a natural landform. Also, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground you would be able to see what they were. In addition, what the picture actually shows is a landform common around the American West.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surefers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing that it's just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nNext, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" Garvin added. \"So, If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people might say that the Mars Orbiter Camera team didn't take the photo cleary than the original Viking photos or they could think that the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars but, on April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" said Garvin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\r\n\r\nLast, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a landforms common aroung the American West.",
        "The computer used to reccognisze peoples emotions uses muscle but the computer is not smart enough to recognize their emotions within their heart and hypocracy,which is the opposite of an emotion,the computer also forgets that there\r\n\r\na talented paople and there are some some people that have mental problems,\r\n\r\nand lastly people that get fraustrated when suprised.Sometimes when a comedian makes up a joke,he expects the audience to laugh,but in most cases 30% of the\r\n\r\naudience find it funny out of the 100%,but if the remaiming 70% finds out that other people are laughing,they just have to follow the crowd and reduce tension\r\n\r\nto the comedian.\r\n\r\nFrom the passage,in paragraph 4,the author says that it's \"unversal\",but again forgets that there are unique people,just like the left handed people and people\r\n\r\nwith high IQ.This doesn't make the computer to recognize everyones emotion,\r\n\r\nunless being forced to make an emotion,but by this,it makes the unique feel left\r\n\r\nout which is a contributing factor to commiting suicide.And in paragraph 8,if faces of paople doesn't lie,what about people with down syndrome and thieves that escapes trials for murder,because there are some murderers that calls the emergency themselves as an acs of deceiving.And as for student,they happily\r\n\r\ncheat in the examination,but when the teacher asks\"how was it\",the student will reply in a sad tone saying that \"it was too hard\".",
        "This is not created by aliens, it was created by landforms and only landforms because aliens are not smart. What would they do with a face, just make a rock out of it? Scientists agree that is was created by natural landforms.\r\n\r\nThe only way it could have been created is by natural landform that happen way longer than when they dicovered the face. In paragraph 7 it says \"Revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien minument after all\". That states that there was no aliens involved with the face. What would aliens use to make the face in the rocks?\r\n\r\nScientists say that in paragraph 12 \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West\". So this means that it doesn't really have any evidence that aliens made it. This just means that it very well could be just natural landform creating things.\r\n\r\nBut, some people may think like the people in paragraph 8. \" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze\".",
        "I think that we should have this Facial Action Coding System. It can make teaching much easier for a teacher and learning much easier on students. The FACS can change just about everything we know about human emotions. This could be a new way to help people in classrooms and people with depression.\r\n\r\nSince this FACS was made we are able to better understand how people are feeling. Wethier its in the classroom helping the teacher better engage his or her students into there lesson, or its helping someone who dosent want to show emoting get help with something thats bothering them.Since the face can show so much more emotion than we can normally see we are able to see deeper down at what they are actually feeling. As in paragraph 6 it quotes \"A Classroom coumputer could recognzer when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrutor.\" Knowing that many people dont want to be in a classroom there whole day this system will be able to change there action of study to where its more enjoyable for the student to sit there and actually learn about the material.",
        "On May 24, 2001 25 years ago something wierd happend on Mars. Viking 1 spacecraft was going around Mars, taking pictures of landing places for its sister ship. While taking pictures the Vicking saw the shadowy likeness of a human face. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time ever. Michael Malin and and his Mars Orbiter Camera, took picturse 10 times shaper then then from the preveous Viking picture. After that they conclued that there was no alien monument after all.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor came realy close for a second look. Garvin said this \" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to the center the Face in look.\" Malins team got an really extraordinary picture of the face, by using camera's absolute maximum resoltion.\r\n\r\nIn the 2001 Viking photo its spans 1.56 meters, in 1976 Viking photo comaperd to 43 meters per pixel.\r\n\r\nAfter all of the studies and looking at the picturese, what the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa. They are landforms common in West American. Its a lava dome that takes a form of a isolated mesa its about the same size and height as the face of Mars. So thats why the pictue is just a natural landform. And not alien artifact.",
        "I am against this Facial Action Coding System because how diffcult it will be for these teacher to put this modification in every school and computer. How long would it take for this project to happen, will it work, going through all this can be a problem, why would we need all this if we can ask one simple question to all the students \"Are you ok?\" Even if the school wants this we will need to take each of the students picture and modify it into a \"3-D computer model program\" as said in paragraph 3 we have 44 major face muscles which they will need to go into to that program and modify it. Every kid has mixed emotions one day they can be happy one day they can be sad, angry, and or stressfull. This Program can not improve or prove how us students are feeling, We would be happy and the computer program pops up with anti-depression pills, Computers are like us humans we mess up sometimes and we arent always right.\r\n\r\nLike what i said we can ask the students directly without any expensive computer programs, with one little questions \"are you ok?\" \"Are you doing fine?\" \"For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/her face. we won't be needing these 3-D facial modifications, sometimes people can be smilling but deep inside they could be mad,sad, angry,glad. I don't think it matters about the face it matter about the heart, nobody can tell how you're feeling with just a face. If you're watching a sad movie and you're crying your happy but sad at the same time how can a computer program no that you're really not sad but happy.",

Scientist should study Venus because they could find more similiaraties between Earth and Venus, there could have been life in Venus long ago, and We could one day live in Venus.\r\n\r\nIf scientists studied Venus they could find many more similarities.

These two quotes shows us we have to study Venus more to see what other similarities it has to Earth.\r\n\r\nScientist should study Venus to see if there has been life at Venus long ago. On paragraph 4 the author states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,\" this means that it once was the most Earth-like planet. On paragraph 4 it also states that, \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth,\" this is telling us that long ago it was probably covered in water and it supported various forms of life. if there is water on the planet, there was probably life long ago.",

It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows\u0097even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" Lots of people believe it is an alien, but it is not.

In fact, the Face is just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nThe Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could make images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

        "I belive that driverless cars are a good idea. Personaly, I don't trust people on the roads. People get distracted easily, can have slow reaction times, and sometimes just are not safe. Driverless cars can fix all these problems easily.\r\n\r\nOne issue is that people easily get distracted. Smart cars, on the otherhand, are complety built for the purpose of diving and analizing the roads. The feature most appealing to me and that fixes this issue is found here in the passage, \" Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.\".\r\n\r\nThe second issue with drivers in cars are the drivers reaction times being to slow. Some people just do not have the reactions to be able to use the breaks fast enough to avoid accidents. These cars do it instantly, as stated in the passage, \" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels and reduce power from ethe engine, allowing far bettter response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\".\r\n\r\nFinaly, sometimes people just are not safe. Doing anything from texting while driving or taking erratic turns without signal can be extreamly dangerous to themselfs or anyone around them.",

I think you need to try seagoing Cowboy program beacause in the passage \"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.\" There was a man named Luke Bomberger he loved this program he even experienced going over the Alantic Ocean six-teen times and also went though the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by the World War ll.

That needed to be recoverdfrom desasters.\r\n\r\nI also think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program because it states that in paragraph six that you care about animals on the way back from safty. Would you like to save a pour animals life? It states that \"Bales of hay and bages of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.\" It also states that they have to clean the stalls. that would mean that the pour animals need your help because they need more people to help them out with the pour animals with feeding them and also cleanding there stalls.",

By having driverless cars it takes away that.\r\n\r\nWhere is the fun in driving if its doing it for you? As a teenager you look forward to first getting a car and driving around with your friends. Its a time where you can bond and be social. By having driverless cars its the fun out it , think about what is fun about sitting behind a wheel while it drives itself?\r\n\r\nDriverless cars create alot of danger also. Even today when drivers are more alert ever , there are millions of people who die in car crashes every year. Imagine the number of people who will die because people are not aware while the car is driving its self. Its in human nature for people to get a certain comfort level while doing something. Thousands of people on the road driving unalert and comfortable is not a safe thing.\r\n\r\nBy having driverless car it takes out alot business also. There's million of kids who learn how to drive thru drivers ed.",
        "In 1976 NASA captured a picture of Mars with the Viking 1. This photo was taken of a Martian mesa which resembled a human face. When this was shown to the public, people went crazy. People said that it was created by aliens, but others say it was\r\n\r\njust a landform on Mars.\r\n\r\nFor my evidence that this photo is in fact a normal natural landfrom on Mars. We shall compare the dates these photos were taken. When Viking 1 first took the picture of the \"Face\" we weren't able to see all of the details. Remember at the time photography wasn't as superb as it was in 2001. In 1998 when MGS took the picture of the \"Face\" we were able to get a clearer product, but there were clouds in the way. If those clouds were not in the way we would have evidence it was a landform sooner. At the perfect time NASA was able to get a clear photo with better technology we were able to see the \"Face\" for what is really was.\r\n\r\nAt the time conspiracy theorist said that NASA was hiding the truth from the public saying that life on Mars did exist, but they were relunctant to show it. Even if they did find life on Mars it would be a huge scientific discovery. Why would we be forced to hide the truth from the people and not answer the biggest question in\r\n\r\nhistory. Are We Alone. Just to add on, these conspiracy theorist did not have enough evidence to prove their claim either.\r\n\r\nNow this ties in with my first claim of technology at the time. if you compare the photo from 1976 and 2001 you can see a major difference. Shading. In the Voyager 1's photo the lighting is not the best. Shadows in the photo make the illusion that there is a face in this rock.",
        "I am against the driverless cars because it would take alot of money to make these cars and they could also be dangerous and cause crashes. If the car needs you to take over and the person isnt paying attencion then it could cause an accident. Another way it could be dangerous is if the car wasnt made right and the technology fails. And maybe people would save money on gas but they would lose alot of money making them because of all the things the car needs like sensors. And if the car did fail whos fault would it be the driver or the manufacturers.",

        "Driving has been a necessary skill in society ever since Ford made the T Model. Since then the use of cars has only become more common within society. People use cars to go to and from work, as well as to travel on vacation and chauffer people around. While driving, people could be doing much more productive things, such as preparing for the arrival of a destination, or doing homework or fun activities. The legitamacy of the development of the driverless car is confirmed by the by the actions that people go through each day and the convenience that the car would provide, once laws are passed to make the car a reality.\r\n\r\nThese days people's lives are filled with stressful tasks such as work, school, and extracurricular activities. A lot of peoples' time is used to drive when the time could be directed towards more productive things. The development of sensor technology (paragraph 5) has allowed for the possibility of a car that can almost drive itself. As companies such as Tesla, Audi, Mercedez Benz, and Nissan come closer to the objective of a car that can completely drive itself (paragraph 10), people are still presented with difficult tasks to fulfill other than driving. That is why the development of technology that can drive itself and take the work load off of the driver and free up time for the driver would be beneficial to society.\r\n\r\nThe arguement that the people might have against the car could be laws that prohibit unattended vehicles on the road, and the conflict between driver or manufacturer if there is an accident. It is clearly stated in the passage (paragraph 9) that manufactureres belive that more states will allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars on roads as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. Many automakers are predicting that the problems ahead will be solved (paragraph 10). Also, the debate between the drivers fault, or the manufacturers fault (paragraph 9) can easily be settled with a few waivers, laws, and signed papers.\r\n\r\nThe convenience and safety of the driverless car is becoming more and more legitimate as manufactureres continue to produce and develop capable cars.",

Driverless cars have always been a fascinating idea in televison, but they seem to be dangerous, expensive, and interface with the law.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are amusing to those who look forward to this new technology, and its unreal and amazing that a car drive it's self, but is it safe? \"Driverless cars\" at the time seem to already struggle with the navigation and attention of the driver to prevent accidents from occuring. As stated by the article, \" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" Driverless cars today aren't all that beneficial and requiredue the attention of drivers, how can we be positive that the new cars said to come will be ready to prevent accidents without the requirence of human attention? Not only do these cars seem to be safeless, but due to all that worl that is said to come and all the new technology, dont they seem expensive and out of reach?\r\n\r\nThe driverless cars are said to come, but with the technology that will be invested into this project, it seems to be out of reach from those who are interested. As stated by the article, \"...but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters, they needed a whloe lot of sensors.\"",
        "Will this technology be of any value in the classroom? This technology seems cool and all but will it really help? If this technology can read facial expressions then it could be a good thing but this is why it would not help.\r\n\r\nWhen you are in school do you ever feel bored? We all do sometimes that is just how things work. Now do you think that if our computers could tell if we were bored that it would make the lesson any more exciting. The lessons that we are taugh are mostly given to the teachers or the teachers make it. If our computers think that we are bored of the lesson it wants to change that. How does that happen? The teahcer would have to make more than one lesson to teach the class. There are also things that are just completely boring at school there can not be a way to make them any better.\r\n\r\nThen there is also one or two good things about it like if it were able to detecte if someone were not feeling very good about themselves. They might need help but not come out and say it, this technology could help with that. If you put this in a school you would just get a lot of stressed out faces that have to much homework to do while still trying to have a life.

        "Is the Facial Action Coding System Useful in Classrooms?\r\n\r\nWhat if there was a machine capable of not only reconizing, but also understanding feelings via facial expressions? There actually is a machine that could do that. It is called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. This technology could be very useful in classrooms, it could reconize the emotions of the students, it could help identify or even prevent certain situations before they even happen by identifying a problem, and it could help give teachers much needed feedback on the class that they wouldn't verbally recieve.\r\n\r\nFACS constructs a 3-D model of the face. It takes into account all 44 maajor facial muscles to determine the feelings or emotions of a person. For example, if you raise your forntalis pars lateralis, or the mucles above your eyes, you are displaying surprise. Using this technology in classrooms could help learn the emotions of students and show how they are feeling.\r\n\r\nIdentifying emotions in the classroom could be very useful. Students on average sit in classrooms for 6-8 hours a day. Their emotions are still developing and they themselves are still maturing. Sometimes, students may have breakdown or outburst because of various reasons. A student might be stressed out about their grades and begin to preform poorly. Usinng FACS this behavior could be predicted and prevented, letting the teacher know that that student needs a little extra encouragement or more academic assitment. Also, the school enviroment has many variables aside from classrooms alone and that could also cause problems. A student who becomes angry at their classmates has the possibilty of putting them in trouble, It coould either lead to a fight, confrontation, bullying, an other things. Yet, if the problem could be determined becore it could even start, it could help defuse or prevent the situation from escalating resulting in a safer learning enviroment.",
        "My approach on drivless cars is, everything works perfectly, the car coudln't get better than that. It has sensors to notify you that there is an accident ahead, or a road blocik ahead. I got the following details from the passage. I would honestly buy one, it seems much, safer than the average car. When you drive the average car now people tend to get drunk and reckless drive. But the Driverless car prevents that because there are alot sensors.\r\n\r\nI would rather drive the Driverless Car because it is much safer for younger drivers. The whole entire car is like a human steering the wheel, I read this part in the passage. \" The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.\" So the car is like a professional driver. Drunk drivers would be safer driving the driverless car, instead of a 2012 Impala. The driverless car is a much safer car for the community.\r\n\r\nI have came to my conclusion that the driverless car is safer than an average car. The driverless car can steer itself, the driverless car has driven more than half a million miles without crashing, and the driverless car mimics the skill of a human at the wheel."

        "Driverless cars are exciting because they operate like taxis, with someone picking you up. Drivers would not be bored waiting to drive since they could use their vehicles to transport others to their destinations. Uber is another option for getting a ride to where you need to go, for a fee.\n\nTo become an Uber driver or a taxi driver, you must be prepared to run errands, especially in a big city with a high population. A touch sensor on the steering wheel ensures the driver stays in control, and GM has designed driver's seats to vibrate in case the vehicle is in danger.\n\nSensors are not a new concept; in the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors in the creation of antilock brakes. While sensors are prevalent, they are not always noticeable until you interact with them, at which point they may trigger a signal. Manufacturers have installed cameras to monitor drivers, ensuring they are focused on the road. These cars are predicted to use half the fuel of today's taxis, offering greater flexibility than a school bus. The speaker believes such vehicles would revolutionize the world.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\" has captivated the imaginations of many, leading some to believe it's an alien creation. However, a closer look reveals a more mundane explanation.  Contrary to popular belief, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests this formation is a natural phenomenon, not an extraterrestrial artifact. There simply isn't enough evidence to support the alien theory, while plenty points to a natural rock formation.\n\nThe 2001 image captured by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) clearly depicts this large rock formation, resembling a butte or mesa, a common geological feature also found on Earth.  As explained in \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the image debunks the face theory.  The formation, viewed in high resolution, doesn't resemble a face at all.  This isn't the first, nor will it be the last, time scientists have encountered such formations on Mars. The planet is covered in them.\n\nSome proponents of the alien theory accuse NASA of concealing the truth.  However, this claim lacks logic.  Discovering an ancient civilization on Mars would be a monumental achievement for NASA, guaranteeing further funding and research opportunities. As \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" points out, those managing NASA's budget would be thrilled to find evidence of such a civilization. Hiding such a discovery would be counterproductive.",
        "The author should continue studying Venus despite its dangers.  Current knowledge of Venus reveals a hostile environment: an atmosphere composed of 97% carbon dioxide, shrouded in sulfuric acid clouds.  The surface pressure is 90 times that of Earth, and despite Mercury's proximity to the Sun, Venus boasts the highest average surface temperature in our solar system.\n\nThis extreme environment explains the difficulty in exploring Venus.  No spacecraft has survived on the surface for more than a few hours, likely due to the intense conditions.  This explains the absence of a long-term lander on Venus for over three decades. However, this lack of sustained exploration doesn't signify surrender.  Scientists are actively seeking solutions to this technological challenge.\n\nNASA, for example, is exploring innovative approaches to studying Venus.  Sending humans presents significant difficulties, as any mission would likely be limited to orbiting the planet, precluding direct sample collection like rock or gas retrieval.  Currently, image capture remains the primary method of remote study.\n\nDespite these obstacles, continued exploration of Venus remains crucial.  The author's pursuit of understanding this enigmatic planet should be encouraged, even in the face of daunting challenges.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n**The \"Face on Mars\": A Natural Formation**\n\nThe mysterious \"Face on Mars\" has sparked debate between those who believe it's evidence of alien civilization and those who, like myself, see it as a natural landform. Several key factors support the latter interpretation.\n\nFirst, prior to discovering this formation, NASA had no indication of alien presence on Mars. This absence of previous evidence suggests the formation is likely natural rather than artificial.\n\nSecond, the imaging technology used was state-of-the-art. NASA's team employed high-resolution cameras operating at maximum capability, ensuring detailed capture of the formation's features. When they returned for subsequent imaging with even more advanced equipment, the results further supported the natural formation theory.\n\nThird, the team's ability to magnify these images up to three times their original size allowed for unprecedented ground-level detail. This enhanced visualization capability helped scientists thoroughly analyze the formation's characteristics.\n\nThe combination of these factors\u2014the lack of prior evidence for alien life, the use of advanced imaging technology, and the ability to examine highly magnified views\u2014strongly suggests that the \"Face on Mars\" is an extraordinary example of natural geological processes rather than artificial construction. While some may continue to speculate about extraterrestrial origins, the scientific evidence points to a natural explanation.",

        "Driverless cars would be a positive advancement in our modern society because they offer enhanced safety, cost-effectiveness, and convenience. Although they still have a long way to go in terms of development, their potential benefits make them a promising investment for the future.\n\nThese high-tech cars, once fully developed, could be significantly safer than current buses or taxis. As explained in Chapter 4, using Google's mostly-driverless car as an example, a modified Toyota Prius is equipped with a variety of sensors, including position-estimating sensors, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. These sensors provide a, \"constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings,\" offering a level of awareness far beyond human eyes, which, once fully developed, could greatly enhance safety.\n\nDriverless cars would also be cheaper and more environmentally friendly in the long run.

        "I don't think that the technology that shows people's emotions should be accessible to everyone. I believe it should be reserved for scientists to delve deeper into human emotions and understand how they impact us. Allowing anyone to interpret emotions just from a single picture could potentially be detrimental in certain situations.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where someone is initially feeling very happy, but then a sad thought crosses their mind, such as the passing of a pet, causing them to feel a bit down. If they then share a picture with a friend, the friend may misinterpret the situation, assuming something terrible has occurred, leading to unnecessary worry and conflict, potentially damaging their friendship.\n\nI'm not suggesting that this technology wouldn't have its merits, but it could also have negative consequences. There are different perspectives on this matter, with some seeing the potential for assisting others, while others view it as a threat or an invasion of privacy.\n\nIn my opinion, this technology shouldn't be introduced just yet, as it could be harmful if misused or misinterpreted.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text with improved clarity, coherence, and flow:\n\n**The Impact of Emotional Recognition Technology in Schools**\n\nSchools play a pivotal role in children's development, serving as the primary environment where they spend most of their formative years. While some students thrive in academic settings, others struggle to connect with the educational experience. Understanding and tracking students' emotional patterns can provide valuable insights that benefit both educators and learners. The ability to read and interpret student emotions offers multiple advantages, from identifying potential mental health concerns to enhancing educational content and creating a more supportive learning environment.\n\nThe academic journey, particularly during middle and high school, coincides with significant developmental changes as students navigate puberty. These biological transformations, coupled with academic pressures, can trigger emotional fluctuations and related challenges. Modern emotional recognition technology can distinguish \"between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (paragraph 7), enabling schools to identify students at risk of developing mental health issues like depression, which often remain hidden beneath carefully maintained facades.\n\nFurthermore, this technology addresses a common educational challenge: student engagement. When \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" (paragraph 6), teachers can precisely identify which portions of their lessons need modification. This real-time feedback allows educators to refine their teaching methods, particularly in challenging subjects, leading to improved comprehension and academic performance.\n\nThe technology's ability to detect basic emotions such as \"happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness\" (paragraph 3) provides schools with comprehensive data to enhance the overall educational experience. This feedback can guide improvements in various areas, from cafeteria services to school events. By understanding students' emotional responses, administrators can make informed decisions about facility improvements and program modifications, ultimately creating an optimal learning environment.",

        "The idea of developing driverless cars is appealing due to their functionality, the technology they use, and their potential benefits. These vehicles operate like normal cars but can drive themselves, which is highly convenient. For instance, if a family is hosting a large celebration and realizes they forgot something at the store, the driverless car can retrieve the needed items, allowing the family to stay home and enjoy the event. These cars rely on significant battery power, reducing the need for traditional fuel and, in some cases, using only a fraction of the fuel we use today.\n\nDriverless cars, anticipated to be a significant part of the future, are expected to be cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient, conserving resources and minimizing ecological impact. These cars operate using a complex system, primarily a large, rechargeable battery, which charges overnight and sustains the car throughout the day, eliminating the need for frequent fuel stops.",
        "The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthwhile endeavor due to its extreme conditions. He provides several compelling reasons for this. One example is Venus's thick atmosphere, composed of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Additionally, the clouds are highly corrosive, with sulfuric acid present in the atmosphere, making the environment even more challenging.\n\nDespite these harsh conditions, scientists are still considering the possibility of visiting Venus, even though the surface is incredibly dangerous. Astronomers are particularly fascinated by Venus because they believe it might have once been quite similar to Earth, long ago. Venus may have been covered with oceans and could have supported various life forms, much like Earth. To this day, Venus features a rocky surface, valleys, mountains, and craters, akin to those found on Earth, underscoring the value of returning to Venus, which seems indisputable.\n\nFurthermore, NASA has a concept for sending humans to study Venus. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle floating 30 miles above Venus's surface, at a height that would allow it to avoid the planet's harshest conditions, though it would still be hot, at about 170 degrees Fahrenheit, with air pressure close to sea level.",
        "In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, the notion of computers being able to accurately define human emotions is becoming increasingly plausible. The potential for software to decipher and analyze our emotions is a concept that is gaining traction in various settings, be it at work or in educational environments.\n\nImagine a world in which computer software is capable of accurately interpreting and gauging human emotions. This would be a groundbreaking development, offering insights into individuals' true feelings that may not be readily apparent from mere facial expressions. In scenarios where individuals mask their emotions with a smile, the software could provide a deeper understanding of their underlying emotional state, offering a valuable tool for communication and empathy.\n\nAs time progresses, individuals may grow weary of expressing the same emotions repeatedly, potentially leading to a sense of stagnation. While the general emotions of happiness and sadness are easily recognizable, the complexity of human emotions extends beyond these basic categories. With the aid of computer software, a vast array of nuanced emotions can be identified and conveyed, enriching the depth of emotional communication.\n\nThe computational abilities of such software mirror the cognitive processes of the human brain, enabling the analysis of emotions with a degree of precision that surpasses human perception. By harnessing the power of this technology, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of their emotions and, in turn, proactively manage and alter their emotional states, thus promoting personal growth and well-being. Through the utilization of this software, individuals can bridge the gap between their outward expressions and their internal emotions, fostering a greater sense of self-awareness and emotional intelligence.",
        "I am mainly in favor of the idea of driverless cars for several reasons that I will explain in this discussion.\n\nOne of the reasons I support driverless cars is their potential to benefit the environment. Just imagine the reduction in air pollution that could be achieved with this innovative technology.\n\nAnother reason for my support is the likelihood of fewer accidents occurring. Considering that car crashes are a leading cause of death in America, the safety aspect of driverless cars is a compelling argument in their favor.\n\nWhile concerns about overpopulation and the emotional toll of losing a loved one are valid, the potential to prevent tragic accidents is a significant advantage of driverless cars.\n\nOne aspect of driverless cars that I am not fond of is their strict adherence to the speed limit. This might seem like a minor drawback, especially in the context of the safety benefits, but in certain situations, such as the inability to move in the face of danger, the automated adherence to rules could pose a risk.\n\nIn the end, the overall benefits of driverless cars outweigh the drawbacks in my opinion. I am a strong advocate of this technology.\n\nThat concludes my viewpoint on driverless cars. I genuinely believe in the potential of this innovation, despite the few reservations I have mentioned.\n\nI hope this discussion has provided some insight into the topic of driverless cars. I also hope that my perspective, though perhaps a bit unconventional, has sparked some interest in the subject. Only time will tell the true impact of driverless cars.",
        "The allure of driverless cars centers around convenience and reduced stress, but significant safety concerns remain.  While the idea of relaxing or even working while the car navigates is appealing, the reality of a technology-driven crash raises serious questions. Who is liable when the driver isn't driving?  Such accidents could lead to substantial financial burdens for the passenger, even if they had no control over the vehicle's actions.\n\nConsider the analogy of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which experience technical glitches regularly.  If these ubiquitous platforms struggle with reliability, how can we confidently entrust our lives to autonomous vehicles?  A minor software hiccup in a driverless car could have catastrophic consequences.\n\nEven seemingly helpful features, like collision warnings, pose potential risks.  A malfunctioning system could fail to alert the passenger to an impending danger, resulting in an accident.  Again, this raises the question of financial responsibility for damages.",

It can provide valuable insights into a child's emotional state, helping identify whether specific situations or individuals trigger happiness, anger, disgust, or fear.  Implementing this technology in schools eliminates the financial burden on parents who might not otherwise have access to such resources.\n\nThis technology can be particularly helpful in addressing bullying.  If a student is being bullied, educators can use emotion recognition software to facilitate communication and identify the perpetrator. By showing the student pictures of potential bullies, teachers can observe facial expressions that might indicate fear or anxiety, providing valuable clues about the bullying dynamic.\n\nFurthermore, this technology can be used to support struggling students. If a student is experiencing academic difficulties or exhibiting withdrawn behavior, educators can utilize emotion recognition to explore potential underlying issues. By involving parents in the process and observing the student's emotional responses to various stimuli, teachers can initiate conversations about potential stressors at home or school, fostering a more supportive and understanding environment.\n\nThese examples illustrate how emotion-recognition technology can be a powerful tool for teachers and parents to gain a deeper understanding of their students and children, particularly those who may be reluctant to verbalize their feelings.  Providing access to this technology in schools ensures equitable access for all families, regardless of their financial situation, and offers a valuable resource for addressing sensitive issues affecting student well-being.",
        "Driverless cars are rapidly approaching a reality, with many companies investing heavily in their development. While the technology promises convenience and possibly increased safety in the future, current iterations pose significant dangers and should be banned until several key issues are addressed.  As Google itself has acknowledged, autonomous driving capabilities have existed under specific conditions since 2009, but these conditions are far from representative of the complex realities of public roads.\n\nOne major concern is the misleading nature of the term \"driverless.\" These vehicles are not truly autonomous.  While they can perform functions like steering, accelerating, and braking, they require human intervention in challenging situations such as navigating construction zones or accidents.  As a result, drivers must remain vigilant and ready to take control at a moment's notice. This expectation creates a dangerous scenario where drivers, lulled into a false sense of security, might not react quickly enough when human intervention is suddenly necessary.  Such delayed reactions could have fatal consequences.\n\nFurthermore, the legal ramifications of accidents involving driverless cars are a minefield.  Determining liability in the event of a technology failure presents a complex legal challenge.  Is the driver at fault, or is the manufacturer responsible? This ambiguity creates a significant legal gray area, opening the door to extensive litigation.  This uncertainty has led many states to restrict or outright ban the testing of these vehicles.  While California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have allowed limited testing of semi-autonomous cars, the majority of states have prohibited them entirely, recognizing the potential for legal chaos and public safety risks.\n\nFinally, the technology itself remains insufficient for public safety.  Current driverless cars are often limited to specific speeds and require drivers to maintain contact with the steering wheel, highlighting the technology's limitations.  For example, some systems can only handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph and utilize sensors to ensure the driver's hands remain on the wheel.  This constant need for driver engagement undermines the supposed convenience and safety benefits of driverless technology.  Paradoxically, the partial automation may increase driver distraction, potentially making these cars more dangerous than traditional vehicles.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\" has sparked speculation about alien involvement, but a rational examination reveals it's most likely a natural landform.  While some cling to the idea of extraterrestrial influence, the evidence strongly suggests otherwise.  This essay will address the two key arguments supporting the natural formation hypothesis: common sense and NASA's scientific findings.\n\nThe core argument revolves around whether the \"Face\" is an alien creation or simply a natural mesa. While some might be swayed by the idea of ancient alien artistry,  NASA's photographic evidence points towards the latter.  As stated in one source, the image depicts \"the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\u2014landforms common around the American West.\"  The clarity of the images, taken on a clear Martian day, further strengthens this conclusion.\n\nSome might argue that crucial details are too small to be discerned in the photographs. However, Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, addressed this concern, explaining that discernible objects are typically \"3 times bigger than the pixel size.\"  He added that even comparatively small objects like \"airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks\" would be visible.  The high resolution and enhanced detail of the images, captured on a clear day, make it highly unlikely that artificial structures would be missed.\n\nAdmittedly, photographs alone can't definitively rule out the possibility of alien involvement.  Could an alien-made structure, disguised as a natural landform, exist?  Hypothetically, yes.  While I concede this remote possibility, the lack of any evidence supporting such a claim makes it highly improbable.\n\nConsidering the sheer improbability of aliens constructing a monument on Mars only to be discovered by humans, the argument for alien involvement weakens considerably.  While the available images depict the exterior, the interior remains unexplored, leaving a sliver of doubt. However, this sliver is so minuscule that it hardly warrants serious consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, the available evidence, including NASA's photographic data and logical reasoning, strongly supports the conclusion that the \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform.  While the possibility of alien involvement can't be entirely dismissed, it lacks credible supporting evidence and relies on highly improbable scenarios.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# The Future of Driverless Cars\n\nCan you envision a future dominated by autonomous vehicles? Driverless cars represent the next significant leap in transportation technology, poised to fundamentally transform our world. This transformation brings numerous promising advantages.\n\nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin envisions a future public transportation system comprising fleets of autonomous vehicles. This innovative system would offer greater flexibility while consuming only half the fuel of contemporary taxis. While Google has already developed a driverless car prototype, human intervention is still required for specific maneuvers, such as navigating driveways.\n\nThese autonomous vehicles rely on an array of sensors positioned around the vehicle to operate effectively. Google demonstrated this technology by modifying a Toyota Prius with these sensor systems, and their test vehicle has logged thousands of miles without incident. However, certain situations still require human intervention, including:\n\n- Construction zones\n- Driveway navigation\n- Heavy traffic conditions\n\nBoth Google and General Motors have developed alert systems to notify drivers when manual control is necessary. However, this technological advancement brings new challenges for state legislators, who must craft appropriate regulations. Critics raise valid concerns about potential system failures and liability issues in the event of accidents\u2014whether responsibility lies with the driver or manufacturer.\n\nDespite these challenges, automakers remain committed to developing autonomous vehicles, confident that current obstacles will be overcome. As industry leaders make progress, other manufacturers are expected to join the race to produce driverless cars.\n\nLike the original author, I maintain an optimistic outlook on the future of autonomous vehicles.",
        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" I chose to be on the manufacturer's side because the sensor is a good and safe idea for us people who drive. They can steer, accelerate, and brake by themselves. Some sensors have a vibration in the seat that tells you when your vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. \n\nThe driverless car is a great idea because the car tells you when you should brake. The reason why this is a good idea is that it can steer for you. What if it is really slippery out and you have no control? The sensor will help you keep the car under control. The sensor also tells you when you should go faster or slow down. This may reduce the number of car crashes. \n\nThe sensor that vibrates when you are driving is a well-thought-out process because if you are driving off the road, your seat will vibrate, indicating you are off the road. It also tells you when you need to get back in your lane. This will reduce car crashes because it helps you stay in the correct driving lane. \n\nLastly, the camera and the beeping noise the car will make help you move out of the way.",
        "Here's my polished version of your text:\n\n# Unmasking The Face on Mars: A Natural Formation\n\nI aim to demonstrate that the famous \"Face on Mars\" was not created by aliens, but is simply a natural landform shaped by geological processes.\n\nThe supposed face is merely an arrangement of rocks and shadows creating a pareidolia effect - our brain's tendency to see familiar patterns, like faces, in random formations. The interplay of Martian topography and lighting conditions produced an illusion of facial features, leading some to mistakenly interpret eyes, a nose, and a mouth where none truly existed.\n\nThe phenomenon gained disproportionate attention, fueling speculation about extraterrestrial life on Mars. This sensationalized story spread rapidly through various media channels, appearing in magazines, books, Hollywood films, and even supermarket tabloids. In reality, it served only to generate free publicity for NASA rather than provide evidence of alien civilization.\n\nWhile some scientists might have wished for the formation to be an alien artifact - as such a discovery could have secured increased NASA funding - they recognized the truth of its natural origins. The imaging conditions, including cloud cover and winter atmospheric effects, contributed to the face-like appearance. Higher resolution photographs later revealed that any artificial structure of significant size, whether a building, pyramid, or even a modest shelter, would have been clearly visible at three times the pixel resolution available.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no evidence of alien presence on Mars.",
        "Have you ever wanted to explore or learn more about other planets? In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus, a nearby planet, holds valuable intel that we need to understand. Is the data and research we could gather from this mysterious planet worth the risk? The author argues that it is indeed worth the risks involved.\n\nVenus presents extreme conditions with its temperatures soaring above 800 degrees Fahrenheit and an atmosphere comprised of 97% carbon dioxide along with highly acidic and corrosive sulfuric acid. These factors pose significant challenges even for unmanned ships, which have only managed to last a few hours upon landing due to these hostile conditions.\n\nOne may wonder why we persist in our attempts to study Venus when our ships can't even survive there for a day. The answer lies in what we stand to gain: valuable insights into both planetary science and space travel. Scientists theorize that long ago, Venus was much like Earth\u2014possibly harboring bodies of water like oceans and lakes, as well as trees and other life forms. Evidence such as rocky sediments featuring valleys, mountains, and craters supports this intriguing hypothesis about its past habitability.\n\nDespite these formidable challenges, advancements in technology provide hope for future explorations. Researchers believe they can utilize more resilient materials alongside robust computer systems reminiscent of those from the 1800s and early 1900s\u2014systems operating on gears rather than delicate electronics\u2014to build sturdier spacecraft capable of withstanding Venus's harsh environment. Tests conducted in controlled chambers mimicking these conditions have shown promising results with materials enduring up to three weeks.\n\nIn light of these developments, should we shy away from pursuing answers on Venus?",
        "The author of \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" strongly advocates for further study and potential human exploration of Venus, despite the planet's hostile environment.  While acknowledging the significant dangers, the author emphasizes the scientific value of such a mission. This argument is built on several key points.\n\nFirst, the author highlights Venus's potential history.  As Earth's closest planetary neighbor and most similar in size and structure, Venus may once have harbored oceans and even life. This tantalizing possibility, along with present-day features like valleys, mountains, and craters \u2013 reminiscent of Earth's terrain \u2013 makes a compelling case for further investigation, as explicitly stated by the author: \"The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making a mission both safe and scientifically productive.\" This sentence clearly signals the author's desire to find solutions to the challenges of Venusian exploration.\n\nHowever, the author also frankly addresses the stark differences between Earth and its \"twin.\"  Venus's thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, sulfuric acid clouds, and scorching 800-degree Fahrenheit surface temperature create extremely inhospitable conditions for human life.  Despite these challenges, the author points out that NASA is actively pursuing solutions to enable both safe and productive missions.\n\nOne proposed solution involves deploying a blimp-like vehicle to hover approximately 30 miles above the Venusian surface. This altitude would offer some protection from the extreme surface temperatures and allow for observation and data collection above the turbulent lower atmosphere. While the high-altitude environment would still be challenging, the author notes that the temperature and air pressure at this height would be potentially survivable for humans, albeit far from ideal.\n\nBy presenting both the enticing possibilities and the daunting realities of Venusian exploration, the author effectively argues for continued research and development.",
        "Facial recognition technology, often abbreviated as FACS (Facial Action Coding System), holds significant potential for enhancing classroom learning, despite some differing opinions.  While computers are already common tools in education, FACS offers a unique advantage: personalized instruction.  Every student learns at their own pace; some grasp concepts quickly, while others struggle.  FACS addresses this challenge by analyzing students' facial expressions to gauge their understanding and engagement.\n\nCurrently, teachers find it difficult to provide individualized support to every student simultaneously. FACS alleviates this burden by automatically adjusting the learning process. If a student appears confused, the system can revisit the material or present it in a different way.  Similarly, if a student shows signs of boredom or distraction, the software can adapt the lesson to recapture their attention and maintain focus.\n\nAs technology advances, computers and robots are becoming increasingly sophisticated.  FACS leverages this progress to create a more dynamic and responsive learning environment. By recognizing and responding to students' emotional cues, this technology ensures that each individual receives the appropriate level of support and challenge, ultimately promoting more effective learning.  Therefore, FACS represents a highly beneficial program with the potential to greatly assist students who learn at varying paces.",
        "Rapid technological advancements bring new inventions into our lives daily.  The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of autonomous vehicles. Although fully autonomous driving isn't yet a reality, the article predicted its arrival by 2020.  From my perspective, driverless cars present significant concerns due to a multitude of potential problems.\n\nA \"driverless\" car isn't entirely driverless. The article states, \"The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel... the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over.\"  This indicates that a driver still needs to grip the wheel and remain vigilant, prepared to intervene if necessary.\n\nDriverless cars pose safety risks due to potential technological malfunctions.  The article raises the question of liability: \"New laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault\u2014the driver or the manufacturer?\"  This highlights the inherent flaws, even in a developed driverless system. As the article mentions, accidents will inevitably lead to disputes over responsibility.\n\nRules exist to protect us, and altering them could create hazardous situations. The article observes, \"Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.\"  This is a valid point; caution is always preferable to regret.",
        "In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, he discusses the development of new facial emotion technology. This technology could be highly beneficial in the classroom as it can accurately interpret a person's emotional expressions, potentially preventing negative outcomes such as suicide.\n\nThe technology works by creating a 3-D computer model of the scanned face, analyzing the 44 major muscles in the human face. For instance, the frontalis pars lateralis muscle, responsible for the expression of surprise, raises the eyebrows. Given the complex nature of human emotions, the software utilizes video imagery to track the intricate facial movements. These facial expressions are then compared to a neutral, emotionless face. While humans can also interpret emotions, the technology provides a more precise analysis, especially in the classroom setting, where a computer can quickly identify a bored or confused student, adjusting the lesson accordingly, mimicking the role of a human instructor.\n\nThe implementation of such technology in the classroom can make the learning experience more engaging and effective, particularly for students who struggle to grasp certain subjects the first time around. Some students require additional guidance, and the technology can offer the necessary support, ensuring the material is better understood. Thus, the integration of technology like this can greatly benefit the classroom, enhancing the educational experience for the students.",
        "In the article, the author discusses the concept of driverless cars, which I believe is a brilliant idea. These vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce car crashes and make roads safer overall. There are several reasons supporting this, many of which are backed by the article.\n\nFirstly, I believe that driverless cars could drive more efficiently than some human drivers. For example, in 2009, a Google car was driven over half a million miles without a crash. These cars are equipped with advanced sensors that can detect and respond to dangers, such as out-of-control skids or rollovers. These sensors can also apply brakes to individual wheels and reduce engine power, allowing for a better response and control than a human driver can manage alone. Although the technology is advanced, drivers are still required to be alert, ready to take over if necessary, ensuring a relaxing yet safe driving experience.\n\nThe development of driverless cars is progressing rapidly, with companies like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan, in addition to Google, aiming to have such cars on the road by 2020. While most driving laws are designed to keep drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, the introduction of driverless cars raises new questions, such as, in the event of an accident, who is responsible, the driver, or the manufacturer?",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# Student Emotions and the Future of Educational Technology\n\nEducational technology continues to evolve, providing students with tools like computers, smartphones, and calculators to enhance their learning experience. A promising new development\u2014the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)\u2014offers potential benefits for both students and teachers by identifying students' emotional states.\n\nFACS could revolutionize classroom management in several ways. When students experience emotional difficulties that affect their participation, teachers can provide targeted support based on the system's insights. More critically, FACS could help prevent school violence by detecting emotional distress signals that might indicate bullying or other concerning situations before they escalate into dangerous incidents.\n\nIn today's classrooms, student engagement varies significantly. FACS could help teachers identify students who are struggling to focus or participate, enabling them to provide appropriate interventions. Conversely, when students display high energy and enthusiasm, teachers can adapt their teaching pace accordingly. This personalized approach acknowledges that students learn best when instruction matches their individual learning rhythms.\n\nThe rising frequency of school shootings in America has become a pressing concern. FACS could serve as an early warning system by identifying students experiencing emotional distress due to bullying or other factors. Through early intervention and counseling, school staff could address these issues before they potentially escalate into violent incidents. Prevention through emotional awareness could be key to creating safer school environments.\n\nBullying remains pervasive throughout school environments\u2014from classrooms to hallways, cafeterias, and bathrooms. FACS could help identify potential bullying situations by detecting negative emotional patterns, such as hatred or aggression. This would allow staff to intervene proactively, whether by addressing the root causes of a potential bully's behavior or supporting students who might be experiencing difficulties at home.\n\nThe implementation of FACS in educational settings represents a significant step forward in creating safer, more supportive learning environments. While this article highlights several key benefits\u2014improving classroom participation, preventing potential violence, and addressing bullying\u2014these represent just a fraction of the system's potential applications. By helping educators better understand and respond to students' emotional needs, FACS could transform the educational experience for students across the country.\n\n_Note: The text has been restructured for clarity, with improved paragraph transitions, consistent terminology, and corrected spelling/grammar.",

        "Autonomous vehicles promise a significant revolution in the automotive industry, offering enhanced safety, increased convenience, and potentially greater fuel efficiency.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments for autonomous vehicles is their potential to dramatically improve road safety.  While initial implementation will undoubtedly present challenges in sensor technology and accident prevention algorithms, continuous development and refinement should lead to highly sophisticated systems capable of minimizing, and ideally eliminating, accidents. As sensor technology advances, drawing on existing systems like anti-lock brakes and stability control, which utilize wheel speed sensors to mitigate skids and rollovers, autonomous vehicles will be able to react faster and more effectively than human drivers. The text highlights this progression, noting how sensor technology in the 1980s evolved to enable sophisticated vehicle control beyond human capability.  This continued advancement in sensors, computer hardware, and software suggests a future where autonomous vehicles achieve unparalleled safety.\n\nConvenience is another key advantage.  Human drivers must remain attentive and are often forced to drive while fatigued or seek alternative transportation if injured or otherwise incapacitated. Autonomous vehicles offer a solution, allowing passengers to travel safely regardless of their physical or mental state.  While some argue that drivers of autonomous vehicles must still remain vigilant, widespread adoption of the technology will ultimately lead to fully autonomous systems. In a future where all vehicles are computer-controlled, complex traffic scenarios, such as merging from a parking lot, will be seamlessly managed through inter-vehicle communication and coordination.\n\nFurthermore, autonomous vehicles have the potential for improved fuel efficiency.  Human driving habits, such as rapid acceleration, often waste fuel.  Computer-controlled vehicles can optimize acceleration and coasting for maximum fuel economy. The text supports this, citing the potential for autonomous vehicles to consume half the fuel of current taxis.  This translates into significant cost savings for owners.\n\nIn conclusion, autonomous vehicles represent a transformative technology poised to reshape the automotive landscape. Their potential to enhance safety, maximize convenience, and improve fuel efficiency makes them a compelling innovation for the future of transportation.",
        "Driverless cars are rapidly approaching reality, as detailed in \"Driverless Cars Are Coming.\"  However, I remain unconvinced that they are ready for widespread adoption. While the technology holds promise, significant safety concerns must be addressed before these vehicles can safely navigate our roads.\n\nThe article proposes two primary approaches to driverless navigation: \"smart roads\" and sensor-equipped vehicles.  The \"smart roads\" concept, involving embedding electrical cables or magnets in the road, as explored by General Motors and Berkeley engineers, presents logistical and financial obstacles.  Rebuilding every road globally is simply impractical. Furthermore, this approach fails to address how these vehicles would operate on roads lacking these modifications.\n\nThe alternative involves equipping cars with sensors, lasers, and receivers, as demonstrated by the Toyota Prius.  While seemingly more feasible, this approach relies heavily on artificial intelligence.  The critical question remains: can AI match human intelligence and reaction time in complex situations?  Can it respond effectively to unexpected events like a deer crossing the road, a cyclist, a child's ball, or even a pothole?  These scenarios demand split-second decisions that current AI may struggle to handle.\n\nEven with a human driver present, as the article suggests, the potential for distraction remains a significant concern.  Buzzing or flashing lights intended to alert the driver to potential hazards could easily be ignored or, worse, exacerbate panic and hinder effective response.  Over-reliance on automation could lead to driver inattention, negating the supposed safety benefits.\n\nThe article positions driverless cars as a solution for preventing drunk driving. However, this argument overlooks a crucial point: impaired \"drivers\" are incapable of taking control in emergencies.  The distractions presented by the car's systems would further hinder their ability to react, potentially turning a supposedly safe option into a dangerous one.  Traditional alternatives like taxis or designated drivers offer more reliable safeguards.\n\nUltimately, the current state of driverless car technology presents more risks than benefits.  While the technology holds long-term potential, relying solely on artificial intelligence and sensors is premature.  Too many unpredictable scenarios could compromise the safety of both passengers and pedestrians.",

        "Having a driverless car would be fascinating. These vehicles are designed to operate autonomously, yet it is essential for the driver to retain the ability to take control when necessary. This feature is particularly important in situations like road construction, where human judgment might be more reliable. Therefore, a driverless car that allows manual control in specific situations would be ideal.\n\nDriverless cars, such as those developed by Google, have been tested under specific conditions since 2009. These cars have driven over half a million miles without a crash, which suggests a high level of safety. However, it is important to note that Google\u2019s cars are not entirely driverless, as they rely on alerts to signal the driver to intervene, such as when navigating complex traffic, pulling in and out of driveways, or dealing with roadwork.\n\nOne of the appealing aspects of driverless cars is the ability to handle tasks like answering emergency calls, as the driver can be alerted to take control if necessary, ensuring a safe response to the situation. If, however, a driverless car were to cause an accident, the responsibility would, in my opinion, fall to the manufacturer, as they are the ones in control of the car\u2019s design, production, and, to a large extent, its operation.",

However, the author questions the reliability of these systems and their potential impact on safety.  Will driver-assist features function flawlessly, or will their failures lead to even greater dangers?  Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, champions driverless cars as the future of transportation, a paradigm shift from the dream of flying cars. Brin believes this technology will fundamentally reshape the world.  Despite the excitement surrounding autonomous vehicles, the author argues against their adoption.  While acknowledging the allure of technological advancements, the author contends that the complex systems within driverless cars are inherently prone to failure, ultimately jeopardizing driver safety.\n\nA central concern is the potential for manufacturers to downplay the risks of driverless technology. Will the public receive a balanced perspective, or will negative aspects be suppressed? The author fears that driverless cars will prove to be another technological misstep.  Quoting the original article, the author highlights the inherent limitations of autonomous systems: \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.\"  This requirement for driver vigilance is further emphasized: \"This means the human driver must remain alert.\" The author argues this dependence on human intervention undermines the very concept of a driverless car, exposing a fundamental flaw in the technology.  Drivers, lulled into a false sense of security, may become distracted or drowsy, unprepared for the sudden need to take control. This reliance on imperfect human intervention increases the risk of accidents.  Overconfidence in the technology could lead to dangerous situations, such as intoxicated individuals relying on the car to navigate them safely home, potentially endangering themselves and others if the system fails.\n\nFurther concerns arise regarding the reliability of driver-assist functions.  The article mentions GM's development of vibrating seats to alert drivers of danger.  However, the author questions the long-term functionality of such systems and the driver's ability to respond appropriately.  Who, the author asks, actually reads instruction manuals thoroughly?  The excitement surrounding new technology may lead to drivers neglecting proper training, creating hazardous situations on the road.  Trying to learn complex systems while driving could exacerbate risks and lead to panic in emergencies.  The author predicts a rise in accident rates, counteracting efforts to improve road safety.\n\nLiability in the event of an accident involving a driverless car is another key concern.  The author believes that the human driver, rather than the manufacturer, will likely be held responsible, even if the accident stems from technological failure.  This raises questions about fairness and accountability in the age of autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe author concludes by reiterating the potential dangers of driverless cars and urging caution.  Would you, the author asks, entrust your loved ones to a technology with such inherent risks?  Instead of improving road safety, the author argues that driverless cars will likely increase accident and fatality rates.  For these reasons, the author believes driverless cars should not be embraced as the future of transportation.",
        "When you join the Seagoing Cowboys, you join a year of adventure. Not only do you get to take care of animals like horses, cattle, and more, but you also get to sightsee as well. \"It's an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,\" says a cowboy named Luke. \"Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,\" he says. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Imagine seeing beautiful cities that you always wanted to see, right in front of your eyes.\n\nSoon enough, you'll know everything there is to know about taking care of the animals, like feeding, washing, grooming, and even playing with them. \"It's an opportunity of a lifetime.\" Additionally, you get to have fun. On board, especially on return trips after animals have been unloaded, the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. You can play table tennis, fence, box, read, whittle, and enjoy other games to pass the time. \n\nBecoming a Seagoing Cowboy is more than an adventure, it opens the world to you, Luke says, \"I'm grateful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of the people of other countries, and their needs.",
        "The Face on Mars has been a subject of debate regarding its origins. Many have speculated that it was created by aliens, but there are several reasons why this theory is not plausible.\n\nFirstly, the Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a photo of the Face on Mars in 1998 that was ten times sharper than the original picture taken by the Viking in 1976. This high-resolution image allowed for a clearer view of the supposed face, revealing no signs of alien construction. The more detailed the images became, the more apparent it was that this formation was simply a natural landform.\n\nIn addition to this, further evidence against alien involvement came in 2001 when Malin's team took another high-resolution photo of the Face on Mars. Despite using advanced technology and maximizing resolution capabilities, no indications of alien craftsmanship could be discerned in these images.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that logical reasoning also points to the improbability of aliens creating the Face on Mars. Multiple photographs taken over time have failed to reveal any traces of extraterrestrial influence or activity around this feature. It is illogical to persist in attributing something as intricate as facial features to beings from another world when all empirical evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nIn conclusion, based on photographic evidence and rational thinking, it is clear that aliens did not create the Face on Mars. The series of detailed images captured by various missions only serve to reinforce the notion that what some perceived as an artificial creation is indeed nothing more than a naturally occurring geological formation.",
        "Have you ever seen the face on Mars? If not, it is a 2-mile landform on Mars that, due to its shadows and other reasons, resembles a pharaoh's face.\n\nWhen the first picture of The Face was taken, it only had 43 meters per pixel, making the little details that could have indicated it was just a bunch of rocks unnoticeable. Moreover, the land was shaped in a way that made it appear as a face. However, in 2001, a more enhanced camera with 1.56 meters per pixel resolution was used. Despite the superstitious beliefs of some, who claim it could be the work of aliens, the new camera would have been able to capture any evidence, such as housing, that would have been necessary to construct such a monument, had it existed.\n\nHaving presented the facts, it is clear that there is a logical, scientific explanation, and it is not, in fact, the work of aliens, as some may believe.",
        "Exploring Venus may not be the best approach to determining how similar it is to Earth, particularly regarding its potential to support life and agriculture. The risks are significant, and the endeavor can be extremely dangerous.\n\nIn the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author refers to Venus as our \"twin sister\" due to its comparable size and density to Earth. However, the problem is that every attempt to explore Venus using spacecraft has failed. Venus is often called Earth's \"twin\" because it is the closest to Earth in terms of density and size. This difficulty might explain why no spacecraft has landed on Venus in over three decades. According to NASA, they are determined to gather the necessary research to assess Venus's habitability, despite the challenges.\n\nNASA is exploring alternative methods to approach Venus, conducting various tests to ensure the spacecraft can withstand the planet's harsh conditions. For instance, \"some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks.\" Another reason to study Venus closely is the limited usefulness of observations made from orbit. \"Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight into ground conditions, as the dense atmosphere prevents most forms of light from penetrating, rendering standard photography and videography ineffective.\" Venus's challenging conditions also prevent the capture of adequate photographs and the safe landing of rovers to collect samples. \"Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\"\n\nDespite the conditions, scientists are determined to find a way to have a person land and gather the necessary information. Venus is not seen as a threat, but rather a challenge. However, the fragility of the human body necessitates the continued use of rovers.",
        "The integration of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) holds promising potential for reading the emotional expressions of students in classrooms. In his article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" Nick D'Alto elaborates on how this advanced software enhances the ability to accurately perceive human emotions, with significant implications across various industries. The application of FACS in educational settings is particularly valuable as it identifies when students are bored or confused, recognizes six basic emotions and even mixed ones, and aids individuals not only in expressing their emotions but also in producing them.\n\nSchool environments naturally elicit a range of emotions among students, both positive and negative. Common feelings observed by teachers include boredom and confusion; however, these can be difficult to discern as students might mask their true feelings with a smile or remain silent due to fear of speaking up. The Facial Action Coding System offers a solution by enabling computers to detect when a student experiences such states. As highlighted in D'Alto's article, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" and modify lessons accordingly, much like an effective human instructor would. This evidence underscores the transformative impact FACS could have on teaching methods by allowing educators to promptly address student disengagement or confusion.\n\nCentral to this technology's utility is its ability to identify six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness\u2014alongside combinations thereof\u2014enabling more nuanced understanding. For instance: wouldn't it be beneficial for teachers if they could accurately determine what mix of emotions their students were experiencing? According to D'Alto\u2019s piece: \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions... associated with characteristic movements of facial muscles,\" while noting that \"the software can even identify mixed emotions.\" Such capabilities relieve teachers from relying solely on guesswork about student well-being as they navigate complex emotional landscapes within classrooms.\n\nEmotions permeate every aspect of life; everyone experiences them daily\u2014and understanding them better allows for more impactful interaction between individuals like teachers and pupils alike! The Facial Action Coding System not only facilitates emotion expression but also aids educators who may struggle conveying enthusiasm required fully engage learners effectively through nonverbal communication alone\u2014as noted by D\u2019Alto observing how \u201cthe Mona Lisa was really intended bring smile your face.\u201d This reinforces potential classroom benefits resulting increased interest levels leading improved comprehension grades amongst wider population subsequently benefiting society overall!\n\nIn conclusion: do you believe utilizing cutting-edge tech such FACS truly enhances comprehension emotional dynamics within academic spheres today? Given its demonstrated proficiency detecting core affective states alongside simultaneous multiple influences affecting behavior positively altering current pedagogical approaches utilized globally\u2014it seems undeniable importance role plays facilitating meaningful connections ultimately fostering enriched learning environments everywhere possible!",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text:\n\n# The Facial Action Coding System: Revolutionizing Classroom Learning\n\nRecent technological advances have introduced the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a groundbreaking tool that can identify human emotions. As described in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" this futuristic technology could transform the educational landscape by addressing three critical aspects of learning: comprehension, engagement, and enjoyment.\n\n## Enhancing Student Comprehension\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in education is students' reluctance to ask questions when they don't understand the material. Many remain silent due to embarrassment or fear, potentially hampering their educational progress. Teachers, despite their expertise, cannot read minds to identify confusion. The Facial Action Coding System could bridge this gap by automatically detecting signs of confusion, allowing educators to adjust their teaching approach and break down complex concepts more effectively.\n\n## Maintaining Student Engagement\n\nThe traditional school day\u2014spanning up to eight hours, five days a week\u2014can naturally lead to periods of disengagement. Students inevitably zone out or become bored during lengthy lessons. By implementing FACS, teachers could receive real-time feedback about student engagement levels, enabling them to adapt their teaching methods and incorporate more dynamic elements into their lessons. This proactive approach could create a more stimulating learning environment for everyone involved.\n\n## Fostering Enjoyment in Learning\n\nEvery student has the potential to find academic subjects they genuinely enjoy, though discovering these interests traditionally takes time.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# The Benefits of Self-Driving Cars\n\nSelf-driving cars represent a significant advancement in automotive technology, offering numerous benefits to various groups of people. One of the most compelling advantages is the ability to relax when fatigue sets in during long drives. When a driver's hands become tired, they can safely transition control to the vehicle's autonomous system. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals with arthritis or other conditions that affect hand mobility.\n\nThe technology behind these vehicles is remarkably sophisticated. As noted in research, \"The combination of all this input is necessary for the self-driving car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.\" This means the vehicle can navigate roads with human-like precision while maintaining safety standards. However, drivers must remain vigilant and ready to take control when needed, especially when the car's warning systems\u2014such as flashing lights or vibrating seats\u2014indicate potential hazards.\n\nFor individuals with arthritis, self-driving cars offer unprecedented independence. These vehicles eliminate the physical strain of constant steering and manual control, allowing passengers to travel comfortably while the car handles navigation. The automotive industry has also focused on enhancing the passenger experience, incorporating entertainment features to make journeys more enjoyable.\n\nWhile self-driving cars can potentially reduce accidents, including those caused by impaired driving, it's important to emphasize that responsible vehicle operation remains essential. The advanced safety features, including windshield alerts and haptic warnings through seat vibrations, create multiple layers of protection for occupants.\n\nThese vehicles also offer broader societal benefits. They can:\n- Reduce driver fatigue\n- Increase mobility for those with physical limitations\n- Enhance road safety through advanced sensing systems\n- Provide a more relaxed travel experience\n\nIn conclusion, self-driving cars represent a significant step forward in automotive technology, offering particular benefits for those with physical limitations while potentially making roads safer for everyone.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) computer offers a valuable tool for reading human emotions. Its sophistication is highlighted by its ability to analyze complex emotional expressions, far exceeding the capabilities of a standard home PC, as explained in paragraph 7.  This complexity is demonstrated in paragraph 1, where the system breaks down the Mona Lisa's expression not into simple categories like \"happy\" or \"sad,\" but into specific percentages of various emotions, offering a nuanced understanding of the subject's emotional state during the painting process.  Furthermore, the system's practical application and effectiveness are illustrated in paragraph 6.  This example shows how FACS can identify reactions to stimuli, such as advertisements, and adapt accordingly \u2013 presenting similar ads in response to smiles and different ones after frowns. This responsiveness demonstrates the system's impressive ability to identify and differentiate between subtle emotional cues. Therefore, the precision, complexity, and practical applications of the FACS computer make it a valuable instrument for interpreting human emotions.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n**The Hidden Dangers of Driverless Cars**\n\n*CRASH! SCREECH!* That could be you in a self-driving car accident. Vehicle collisions remain alarmingly high in America, and many believe autonomous vehicles are the solution. However, self-driving cars may actually increase accident rates due to technological failures, limited reaction capabilities, and reduced driver awareness.\n\nToday's technology, while impressive, remains fallible. Until autonomous systems achieve near-perfection, putting them in control of vehicles poses significant risks. Several states have wisely chosen not to allow or test driverless cars on their roads. Beyond simple malfunctions, these vehicles are vulnerable to cyber attacks, potentially allowing malicious actors to seize control remotely.\n\nConsider the limitations of artificial reaction times. While human drivers must stay alert and responsive, they can process complex, unexpected scenarios in ways that autonomous systems cannot. For instance, if another vehicle spins out of control, a self-driving car\u2014focused solely on reaching its programmed destination\u2014may fail to respond appropriately. While technology offers many benefits, over-reliance on it in critical safety situations is dangerous.\n\nFurthermore, drivers tend to become complacent in autonomous vehicles, paying less attention to their surroundings as they trust the system to handle everything. This creates additional risks. Consider practical limitations as well: when running late, you can't negotiate with a computer programmed to strictly observe speed limits.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text, enhancing its logical flow and coherence:\n\n**Exploring Venus: Challenges, Motivations, and Technological Solutions**\n\nIn \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents a compelling case for Venus exploration despite its inherent dangers. The argument is methodically constructed through three key sections: the planet's hazardous conditions, the scientific significance of exploration, and the technological solutions being developed to overcome these challenges.\n\nThe author first establishes the formidable obstacles of Venus exploration by detailing its extreme conditions. The surface temperature exceeds 800 degrees Fahrenheit, capable of instantly melting most metals. To emphasize the severity, they draw a striking comparison: even submarines designed for Earth's deepest ocean trenches would be crushed by Venus's intense atmospheric pressure. Even maintaining a position above the surface proves challenging due to the unbearable heat.\n\nDespite these daunting conditions, the author then presents compelling reasons for scientific interest in Venus. The planet shares remarkable similarities with Earth, featuring comparable geological formations such as mountains and valleys. Evidence suggests Venus may have once contained water and oceans, making it a crucial subject for understanding planetary evolution. The author also notes the practical advantage of Venus's orbital position\u2014at times, it is closer to Earth than Mars, potentially facilitating exploration efforts.\n\nThe final section addresses technological solutions being developed to overcome Venus's hostile environment. Scientists are creating specialized devices to mitigate the extreme conditions and enable sample collection. Additionally, laboratories are being established to simulate Venus's atmosphere, allowing researchers to develop and test equipment capable of withstanding the planet's harsh conditions.\n\nThrough this structured presentation of challenges, motivations, and solutions, the author effectively argues that Venus exploration, while daunting, is both worthwhile and increasingly feasible.",
        "Have you ever been in your car and thought, \"I wish my car could drive itself\"? Well, it seems you have a fairy godmother because your wish has just come true. Driverless cars are now in the design phase, and they are proving to be incredibly efficient. They are also much easier to manage. Driverless cars simplify life for everyone and need to be manufactured.\n\nThese autonomous vehicles can significantly reduce your risk of an accident. Equipped with advanced sensors, they can detect when an object is too close. As the author points out, \"Those sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers.\" This demonstrates how these cars can enhance the safety of not just you but also your family. Additionally, the cars are equipped with automatic brakes, which can help prevent collisions. The author illustrates this with, \"They can cause the car to apply brakes to individual wheels and reduce power from the engine.\" This shows how the car can avert accidents.\n\nMoreover, these driverless cars are much easier to handle. One way they are easier to manage is their ability to navigate work zones independently. The author illustrates this with the statement, \"They can steer...\" indicating their capability to steer by themselves. They can also navigate around accidents, with the author noting the vehicle's ability to maneuver around obstacles it encounters.\n\nIf that's not enough to convince you, these cars also keep drivers more alert. They can quickly grab the driver's attention when an issue arises.",
        "Students experience a wide range of emotions throughout their school day, from happiness and excitement to boredom and drowsiness. To address the challenge of interpreting student emotions, a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System has been developed. This system allows computers to identify and analyze human emotions, providing a valuable tool for teachers to understand their students better.\n\nBy implementing this technology in the classroom, teachers gain the ability to observe and interpret students' emotional expressions during lessons. If the system detects signs of boredom or drowsiness, teachers can adjust their teaching methods to engage students more effectively. According to Dr. Huang, a classroom computer equipped with this technology could recognize when a student is confused or disengaged, prompting the teacher to provide additional support.\n\nIn addition to enhancing teaching efficiency, the Facial Action Coding System can also serve emotional support purposes. If a student displays signs of sadness or distress, the system can alert the teacher, enabling them to offer guidance or support to the student. This technology not only improves the academic environment but also fosters a more emotionally supportive classroom.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Mystery of the Martian Face: Natural Formation or Alien Creation?\n\nHave you ever wondered if aliens exist? I'm sure you have. While everyone has their own definition of what constitutes an alien, I'd like to share my thoughts on why I believe extraterrestrial beings might be behind the mysterious face on Mars.\n\nFirst, let's consider the alien markings. From what we know, if aliens possess advanced intelligence, they could be responsible for such creations. As noted in research documentation, \"alien markings were hidden by a haze.\" Given their presumed technological capabilities, creating a massive face-like structure would certainly be within their abilities.\n\nThe photographic evidence is intriguing. The 1998 image clearly shows a face-like structure, yet the 2001 photograph reveals a weathered, cracked formation that appears quite different. This transformation could suggest artificial origins, though I acknowledge this is speculative. The unusual characteristics of the formation seem to hint at non-human design.\n\nMoreover, we must consider the context: this is another planet we're examining. Wouldn't it be logical for alien artifacts to exist on worlds beyond Earth?\n\nThrough my analysis, I've concluded that while humans have demonstrated remarkable intelligence and creative capabilities, an advanced alien civilization could certainly possess the skills to create such structures. If Mars was indeed their home, this formation could represent their art, their architecture\u2014their legacy.",
        "Facial Action Coding is a system that can detect and analyze facial expressions to identify emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. While this technology may have potential benefits, its implementation in a classroom setting raises concerns about privacy and distraction for students.\n\nIn a classroom environment, where students are already dealing with academic pressures and personal emotions, having Facial Action Coding could lead to unintended consequences. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing that their facial expressions are being monitored, especially if they are trying to hide their emotions, such as a crush or academic struggles, from their peers and teachers.\n\nIt is important to consider alternative settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes, where Facial Action Coding could be more beneficial. In healthcare settings, this technology could assist in assessing patients' emotional states and providing appropriate care, especially for individuals who may have difficulty expressing their feelings verbally, such as the elderly or those in pain.\n\nFurthermore, the potential for misinterpretation of data generated by Facial Action Coding in a classroom setting, where students may have varying levels of understanding, could create challenges for teachers in tailoring their instruction to meet students' needs effectively. This could lead to a situation where students who are struggling academically may not receive the necessary support, while those who are already excelling may be overlooked, ultimately impacting the overall learning environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while Facial Action Coding may have its merits, its implementation in schools may not be the most suitable choice, given the potential privacy, distraction, and educational implications. It is, therefore, important to carefully consider the appropriate contexts and settings for the use of this technology, ensuring that the well-being and learning experiences of students are prioritized.",
        "The dangers of Venus include gravity, temperature, and air pressure.  The author uses the example of a hovering vehicle, likely a rover, in paragraph five to illustrate the gravitational challenges.  The text explains, \"Just like jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\" This suggests the vehicle would struggle to remain on the surface.  Furthermore, the intense temperature poses a significant threat.  As stated in paragraph five, the temperature on Venus is \"around 170 degrees Fahrenheit,\" which is scorching.  Air pressure presents another hazard, limiting the time one could spend on the surface before needing to return to a pressurized environment.  Again, paragraph five notes the pressure \"would be close to sea level.\"\n\nI agree with the author's assertion that these conditions, while challenging, are survivable for humans.  Films have depicted astronauts enduring harsh planetary environments, lending credence to the possibility of inhabiting Venus should Earth become uninhabitable.",
        "I believe developing these cars would be a great idea.\n\nFirstly, these cars would use only half the fuel, making them better for the environment. They would also produce less pollution. Individuals who care about nature would likely opt for these cars, contributing to the reduction of pollution.\n\nSecondly, the sensors in these cars can trigger actions such as applying brakes to individual wheels and reducing engine power, enabling better response and control compared to a human driver. While the cars developed to date are not completely driverless, continued technological advancements could lead to fully autonomous vehicles. These cars remain attentive to the human driver, ready to hand control back when necessary, allowing for human intervention when needed.\n\nThirdly, driverless cars offer enhanced safety across all aspects. Current traffic laws are predicated on the assumption that a human driver is in control at all times. The technology driverless cars utilize is remarkable. If they can achieve this level of sophistication now, the possibilities for the future are endless.\n\nLastly, driverless cars would not only make driving easier for individuals, but also improve the quality of life for everyone on the planet.

        "Can technology truly sense emotion? Can your computer determine if you're happy or sad? These are some of the questions the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) seeks to answer. Utilizing technology to interpret the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable. It can help keep students engaged, active, and eager to learn. Tailoring a learning program to match a student's interests can foster a positive attitude toward education.\n\nThe Facial Action Coding System is a powerful tool for reading students' emotional expressions. It can help maintain student engagement and activity. In today\u2019s schools, it's not uncommon to hear of students dozing off in class. Those who are not engaged in learning activities tend to fall asleep or engage in unproductive behavior, causing them to miss potentially important lessons. Dr. Huang notes, \u201cMost human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.\u201d Utilizing a computer to detect when a student is becoming bored is a valuable tool because it can adjust the lesson, preventing the student from losing interest and missing out. With a program that identifies when a student is bored or uninterested, more students are likely to stay on task and engage with the lesson.\n\nIn modern schools, technology is being integrated at an increasing rate. At Fishers High School, every student is required to have a learning device, such as a laptop or iPad. More classes are transitioning to online platforms, and without a real instructor, students can easily become bored or distracted.\n\nDr. Huang is quoted, \u201cThen it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\u201d Here, Dr. Huang is referring to the Facial Action Coding System's ability to detect student emotions to tailor the lesson to what is more appealing to them. This is a valuable tool, as it can help students become more engaged in their learning.\n\nThe use of the Facial Action Coding System to read emotions is a valuable tool in the classroom.",
        "Is it a naturally formed face, or is it made by aliens? As a scientist, I assure you that it is a naturally occurring rock formation. There are several reasons why it is not made by aliens, which will be explained in the following three paragraphs.\n\nThe first reason is that in 1976, NASA's Viking 1 captured an image of a face. Initially, we thought it might be an alien face or a structure created by aliens. However, in 2001, we obtained a clearer, higher-quality image of the same face, which was ten times sharper than the original. When this image was published on the JPL website, it revealed that the face was, in fact, a natural landform, not a creation of aliens.\n\nWe conducted further tests to confirm that the structure was a natural formation, rather than a face made by aliens, and indeed, it was a natural landform. It was not, as initially speculated, an alien monument, although, upon a later search, it was a challenge to locate it again.",

        "Driverless cars have advanced significantly towards their intended purpose, but they do not completely eliminate the need for a driver. Despite the development and testing of driverless cars to potentially reduce accidents, the issue of accidents will always remain a concern. This raises questions about accountability in case of accidents involving driverless cars.\n\nThe blame game in accidents involving driverless cars could lead to legal complexities. Manufacturers may try to avoid liability, while drivers may not want to be held responsible for incidents that occur with these vehicles. This could result in an increase in lawsuits against manufacturers for failing to deliver truly autonomous driving capabilities as promised.\n\nCurrently, drivers are responsible for operating their vehicles and practicing defensive driving techniques to prevent accidents. In contrast, with driverless cars, drivers may need to monitor and intervene in the vehicle's operations more frequently than anticipated. The reliance on technology raises doubts among consumers about the safety and reliability of such vehicles.\n\nThe costs associated with accidents are significant, as are potential lawsuits related to driverless car incidents. The expensive technologies integrated into these vehicles contribute to their high price tags, making them inaccessible for many consumers who typically target more affordable options when purchasing a car.\n\nAs advancements continue in everyday vehicles without substantial decreases in prices, it becomes clear that driverless cars cater primarily to affluent individuals due to their exorbitant costs. This pricing strategy further alienates middle-class families looking for reliable transportation options within their budget constraints.\n\nIn summary, given the ongoing challenges around accountability, reliance on users' interventions even in \"driverless\" scenarios, and unaffordable price points make it evident that widespread adoption of driverless cars may not be a feasible or practical solution at this time. Ultimately, there is still room for improvement before fully embracing this technology as a standard mode of transportation.",
        "This piece presents my opinions on the topic of driverless cars and explains my reasoning behind them. I believe you will find my perspective compelling.\n\nIn my view, driverless cars offer significant benefits. Advanced computer systems can detect danger more quickly than the human eye or mind. For instance, if a small animal suddenly darts in front of your car, you might hit it because of your speed and the delayed realization of the animal's presence. In contrast, the quick response of a driverless car could prevent the accident.\n\nAnother advantage of driverless cars is the reduced risk of injury. Consider the situation where you're driving after a long, exhausting day. If you fall asleep at the wheel, the car, noticing the absence of your hands on the wheel, would safely come to a stop. This feature significantly enhances the safety of the driver and others on the road.\n\nIn conclusion, the reasons I've outlined illustrate the enhanced safety of driverless cars. While I acknowledge the existence of potential dangers, I believe the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. I hope the reader of this piece finds the argument convincing.",
        "In the modern age, technology has advanced significantly, leading to remarkable innovations such as driverless cars. These vehicles, capable of navigating without human intervention, have both benefits and drawbacks. However, the disadvantages currently outweigh the advantages. Driverless cars pose risks due to their lethality, legal complications, and time-consuming manufacturing processes.\n\nOne of the primary concerns about driverless cars is their potential danger. They are not fully tested and can cause severe injury if not handled properly. As highlighted in paragraph 9 of the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" manufacturers believe that more states will adopt these vehicles once they are proven more reliably safe. This statement underscores their current instability and indicates that further testing is necessary to ensure user safety.\n\nAdditionally, utilizing driverless cars for testing purposes presents legal challenges. According to paragraph 9 of the article, \"in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.\" This legal restriction complicates efforts to identify shortcomings in the technology and hinders its marketability. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate over liability in case of a malfunction: if someone gets injured due to a technological failure, who should be held accountable\u2014the driver or the manufacturer? These issues highlight how legal obstacles impede progress in developing this innovation.\n\nAnother significant drawback is the extensive time required for production. The development process is lengthy; as noted by the author in paragraph 5 of the article, \"within 10 years\" sensor technology evolved sufficiently just to detect dangers like skids or rollovers accurately. Such protracted timelines make it challenging for companies to bring complete products swiftly into consumer markets.\n\nIn conclusion, while driverless cars offer exciting possibilities for consumers\u2014such as increased convenience\u2014their negative aspects currently overshadow potential benefits due largely due largely because they are unsafe at present levels (due?)",
        "Here's the polished version with improved structure, grammar, and flow:\n\n**Venus: A Worthy Scientific Pursuit**\n\nVenus is a worthy pursuit for scientific exploration, despite its inherent dangers. While the planet presents significant challenges for close examination, these very challenges make it an intriguing subject for scientific study.\n\nOne compelling reason to study Venus is its unique complexity. Although Venus is easily visible from Earth's safe vantage point, conducting detailed examinations of the planet has proven exceptionally challenging. This contrast between its visibility and accessibility makes it an fascinating subject for scientific investigation.\n\nVenus's proximity to Earth provides another strong argument for its study. As our closest planetary neighbor, it offers relatively shorter travel distances compared to other celestial bodies. However, this proximity belies the significant obstacles researchers face when attempting to study the planet up close. As noted in scientific literature, \"Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study despite its proximity to us.\"\n\nPerhaps most intriguingly, astronomers are particularly fascinated by Venus because of its potential historical similarity to Earth. Research suggests that Venus may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. This possibility raises important questions about planetary evolution and could provide crucial insights into Earth's potential future.\n\nIn conclusion, Venus merits continued scientific pursuit for several key reasons: its scientific complexity, its proximity to Earth, and its possible historical similarities to our own planet.",
        "The safety of driverless cars is a serious concern. While proponents tout their potential benefits, the risks associated with their widespread adoption warrant careful consideration.  Are they truly worth the potential dangers?  I believe relying solely on automated systems could introduce new hazards, even surpassing the risks posed by human error. Imagine a self-operating vehicle navigating complex scenarios; the potential for unforeseen issues is vast.\n\nOne key concern revolves around the handover of control.  As described, these vehicles can handle routine driving tasks, but they are designed to alert the human driver when complex situations arise, such as navigating construction zones or accidents.  This requires the driver to remain vigilant and ready to assume control instantly.  However, human drivers are notoriously prone to distraction \u2013 texting, phone calls, and adjusting the radio are common occurrences.  What happens when a driverless car requires human intervention, but the driver is inattentive?  The consequences could be catastrophic, leading to accidents and potentially fatalities.\n\nFurthermore, the question of liability in accidents involving driverless cars remains complex.  Even with potential changes to driving laws, determining fault in the event of a technology failure will be challenging.  If the system fails to alert the driver, resulting in injury, who is to blame: the driver who should have been paying attention, or the manufacturer responsible for the faulty technology?  Both parties bear some responsibility, creating a legal gray area.",
        "Cars today are getting closer to being able to drive on their own, potentially changing the way people live and use transportation in a positive manner. While they are not yet entirely \"driverless\" and still require a driver, it is a significant step in that direction. Driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the public transportation system, reduce accidents, and assist those who struggle with driving skills.\n\nDriverless cars are poised to become the future of public transportation. These vehicles are anticipated to replace taxis and even buses. Google co-founder Sergey Brin envisions a future where driverless cars offer more flexibility while cutting fuel usage in half.\n\nIn addition to transforming public transportation, self-driving cars are expected to enhance road safety by reducing the likelihood of accidents. Car manufacturers have implemented rigorous safety measures, equipping the cars with sensors throughout. Google, in collaboration with companies like Toyota, has developed a modified Toyota Prius with a range of advanced sensors, including a position-estimating sensor, a rotating sensor, a video camera, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. These sensors are designed to automatically apply brakes and reduce engine power, allowing the driver to regain control.\n\nWhile driverless cars are designed to operate autonomously, a passenger must be present to take control in case of an emergency. BMW, in 2013, introduced the \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" a system that enables cars to manage driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, with touch sensors to ensure the driver maintains a grip on the wheel.",
        "Here's a restructured and edited version of the text, improving flow, coherence, and correcting spelling/grammatical errors:\n\n**The False Promise of Driverless Cars**\n\nWhen I hear \"driverless cars,\" I envision pressing a single button, entering a destination, and letting the vehicle take control. However, the reality falls far short of this expectation. These vehicles aren't truly autonomous - drivers must remain alert and ready to take control when necessary. This fundamental contradiction raises the question: what's the point of a \"driverless\" car that still requires active driver participation?\n\nSafety concerns are my primary reservation. The complex network of wires, sensors, and electronic systems could malfunction at any moment. A sensor misreading could trigger sudden braking, potentially causing accidents or injuries. The article describes numerous required components - rotating roof sensors, wheel monitors, and embedded track systems with electrical cables - making these vehicles seem more like spaceships than cars.\n\nThe economic implications are equally troubling. Implementation would require massive infrastructure investments to modify existing roads. Who will bear these costs? Furthermore, only luxury manufacturers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are developing this technology, with plans for release by 2020. The concentration in high-end vehicles suggests that driverless technology will remain accessible only to wealthy consumers.\n\nInterestingly, some manufacturers are moving in the opposite direction. BMW's \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" still requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel - a more practical approach to automated driving assistance. This contrast highlights the industry's uncertainty about fully autonomous vehicles.",
        "Driverless cars are a promising concept, but they have their drawbacks. They are more susceptible to accidents than cars driven by humans. One significant vulnerability of driverless cars lies in their complex sensor systems. The rooftop sensor is especially critical, and if it sustains any damage, the car is unable to operate autonomously. In such a scenario, the passenger would need to take control and drive the car. Malfunctions, especially on highways, could lead to car accidents and related incidents. Furthermore, issues of sensor privacy must also be carefully considered.\n\nPrivacy is another major concern, as manufacturers are contemplating the use of cameras to monitor drivers' focus on the road. This invasion of privacy, with manufacturers surveilling occupants, raises significant ethical issues. Privacy, along with the need to invest in a car that still requires human intervention, is a critical concern.\n\nDespite the advancements, driverless cars still demand human intervention, particularly in navigating through construction zones and managing unforeseen incidents. Manufacturers have implemented systems to alert drivers to potential issues, suggesting that, in practice, the driver still plays a pivotal role.",
        "I am here to discuss the debate surrounding the \"Face on Mars\" and to clarify that it is not necessarily the face of a Martian. As a scientist, I understand that there are explanations supporting both sides of this argument. My perspective is that the face could be a misinterpretation. It might simply be a pile of rocks, as there are many peculiar formations on this planet with unusual shapes. It's not always about Martians or aliens.\n\nTo begin with, while the possibility exists that it could be an alien face, there is a strong likelihood that it is not. Firstly, the face is much too large to be a real face. According to the article, it is measured in meters, which seems almost impossible. The article also suggests that the face is an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks, making it appear face-like. Additionally, the article notes that the face appears the same every time the area is surveyed, reinforcing the illusion theory.",
        "Driverless cars have sparked significant debate about their safety and reliability. Despite the advancements in technology, everyday people die in car crashes while driving manually, raising questions about the trustworthiness of a vehicle operated by computer programming. I believe that driverless cars could potentially be a tragic disaster due to the possibility of an equal number of car crashes occurring.\n\nFor instance, Google co-founder Sergey Brin mentioned that driverless vehicles would require sensors placed everywhere on the vehicle. This raises concerns: what if one sensor malfunctions or stops working while transporting passengers? Additionally, there is the risk of accidents involving pedestrians, such as children riding bicycles on the street who might get hit by these autonomous vehicles.\n\nThese vehicles might not have a positive impact on society. While experimenting with them could be entertaining, it wouldn't be enjoyable if they break down in transit, forcing you to walk to your destination. There's also concern about GPS failures causing these cars to run red lights or stop signs, potentially leading to serious injuries or fatalities for passengers.\n\nThe prospect of encountering issues like flat tires on highways is another concern. In such situations, you may find yourself stranded without immediate assistance. The claim that Google's car can predict impending crashes seems exaggerated because human drivers often face blind spots\u2014a limitation shared by these vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there are practical limitations; for example, if driverless cars are restricted to speeds of 25 mph, this isn't helpful when driving on highways or when you're in a hurry. It\u2019s also contradictory for these so-called \"driverless\" vehicles to require drivers to keep their hands on the wheel using special sensors\u2014this undermines their autonomous nature.\n\nManual driving can still result in occasional malfunctions; however, entrusting one's life entirely to technology introduces new risks and uncertainties.",
        "I strongly disagree about driverless cars. Could you imagine everyone in the world driving in a vehicle that could control where and when you go somewhere? I think it would be absolute chaos. I couldn't imagine driving in a vehicle that could take control on its own; it would be way too skeptical for me.\n\nFirstly, driverless cars are not 100% durable nor safe. In reality, no roads have any electrical currents running through them to make any car more secure. It's illegal in many states to even test computer cars because this company hasn't proved their car to be reliably safe. Driverless cars, in my opinion, are not safe. Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, stated that \"General Motors created a concept car that would run on a special track.\" That track for these driverless cars was embedded with electrical cables that sent radio signals to the front of the car. \n\nSecondly, in this whole article, I didn't hear one thing about the driverless car being able to sense any size animal. Animals cause many accidents or deaths in the U.S. Animals are dangerous when you're driving, and many are unpredictable. This car has lots of little gadgets and electronics in it.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a technology designed to detect the emotional state of individuals by analyzing facial features and muscle movements, presents both potential benefits and drawbacks. While proponents suggest its value in diverse settings, from classrooms to workplaces, a critical examination reveals a more nuanced perspective.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments for FACS implementation lies in its potential to improve the educational environment.  By recognizing subtle emotional cues in students, educators could identify those struggling with hidden anxieties, sadness, or fear. This early detection could enable timely interventions, potentially reducing disruptive behaviors, bullying incidents, and academic underperformance.  Understanding a student's emotional state could provide invaluable insights, allowing teachers to tailor their approach and offer personalized support, ultimately fostering a more positive and productive learning atmosphere. As the article mentions, FACS could even help understand historical figures' emotions by analyzing their portraits. Imagine uncovering the emotions Da Vinci imbued in the Mona Lisa! This potential to analyze historical depictions of emotion offers exciting avenues for research and understanding.\n\nHowever, the introduction of FACS also raises significant concerns.  The claim that it could replace trained professionals in fields like psychology or social work overlooks the complexity of human emotion and the crucial role of human interaction in therapeutic settings. The time, money, and effort invested in these professions shouldn't be readily dismissed, and the potential displacement of human expertise by a technological system warrants careful consideration.  While FACS might offer a broad overview of emotional states in a group setting, it cannot replace the nuanced understanding and individualized support provided by human professionals. Relying solely on technology for emotional assessment risks oversimplification and could lead to misinterpretations with potentially harmful consequences.\n\nFurthermore, the very premise of relying on technology to interpret emotions raises ethical questions.  Do we want to live in a world where machines constantly scrutinize our faces and judge our emotional states? While proponents argue for the benefits of emotional transparency, the potential for misuse and the erosion of privacy cannot be ignored.  The notion that a computer can definitively understand our emotional state better than ourselves or trained professionals is a bold claim that requires further scrutiny.\n\nIn conclusion, while FACS offers intriguing possibilities, particularly in educational settings, its widespread implementation should be approached with caution. The potential benefits of early emotional detection and personalized support in schools must be weighed against the ethical implications, the potential for job displacement, and the risk of oversimplifying the complexities of human emotion.  While FACS may prove to be a valuable tool in specific contexts, it is crucial to avoid overreliance and to prioritize the irreplaceable value of human connection and expertise.  Further research and careful consideration are necessary to determine the appropriate role for FACS in our society.",
        "The prospect of self-driving cars, like those being developed by Google, raises significant questions about the future of driving.  While reaching the age of 16 traditionally grants driving privileges, the development of autonomous vehicles may soon make a driver's license obsolete.  However, I believe the potential drawbacks of these vehicles outweigh their benefits.  From safety concerns to legal ambiguities, the risks associated with self-driving cars present a compelling argument against their widespread adoption.\n\nThe article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" highlights both the positive and negative aspects of autonomous vehicles.  While acknowledging potential advantages, I believe the negative aspects are far more critical. The article rightly questions liability in the event of an accident caused by a technological failure: \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault\u2014the driver or manufacturer?\" This question underscores the inherent risks associated with relying on complex technology. The article also points out the current legal landscape: \"traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.\"  This demonstrates widespread concern about the safety of autonomous vehicles.\n\nWhile proponents might argue that removing human error from the equation will reduce accidents, technology introduces its own set of risks. The rise in accidents due to distracted driving illustrates the dangers of human error, but transferring control to technology doesn't eliminate the possibility of failure.  2015 saw a surge in car crashes, largely attributed to texting and driving.  Eliminating human drivers wouldn't necessarily solve the problem; rather, it would shift the potential for error to glitches, hacking, and even theft. These technological vulnerabilities could lead to new forms of danger, potentially facilitating criminal activity and creating unforeseen avenues for destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of self-driving cars presents more dangers than advantages. Although they may appear more sophisticated and potentially efficient, the risks of accidents, technological failures, and malicious exploitation are too significant to ignore. While Google and other companies continue to develop this technology, so too will those who seek to exploit its vulnerabilities.",

Nevertheless, I believe autonomous vehicles represent the future of transportation and should be widely adopted.\n\nGoogle should prioritize making these vehicles available globally, especially considering our technology-dependent society. The advanced safety features provide drivers with enhanced security on the road. As noted in technical documentation, \"The Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors... The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.\" These vehicles are programmed to replicate human driving behaviors, potentially reducing accidents and collisions.",
        "The development of driverless cars presents potential dangers to society.  While Google developed a self-driving car under specific conditions as early as 2009, these vehicles have been banned from testing in certain states due to safety concerns.  This limited testing environment raises a crucial question: how can we thoroughly evaluate the performance of driverless cars in diverse conditions if testing is restricted?  Proponents argue that these systems are designed to *assist* drivers, not replace them entirely, but the line between assistance and full autonomy continues to blur.\n\nAs far back as the 1950s, General Motors developed a self-driving car, albeit limited to a specialized test track. According to \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" this track used embedded electrical cables emitting radio signals to a receiver on the car's front end, enabling the system to stop the vehicle if necessary.  However, this controlled environment doesn't reflect real-world complexities involving other drivers and unpredictable situations.  Modern driverless cars rely heavily on sensors.  Google's modified Toyota Prius, for example, includes sensors on the left rear wheel, the roof, and near the rearview mirror, as well as automotive radar and GPS.  While numerous sensors improve the car's ability to detect surrounding movement, a critical question remains: what happens if a sensor malfunctions?  A failure could compromise the car's ability to perceive its environment, leading to potential accidents.\n\nBMW has developed a \"traffic jam assistant\" (Driverless Cars Are Coming) capable of handling driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, provided the driver keeps their hands on the wheel.  While the car can steer itself, this feature raises safety concerns.  The car might react to sensor input and suddenly swerve, potentially colliding with another vehicle.  The sensitivity of these sensors could lead to overreactions to even minor movements.  Additionally, the car's ability to accelerate and brake autonomously presents risks.",
        "I believe the development of self-driving cars will enhance our future. The introduction of these vehicles offers significant benefits: they allow drivers to engage in other productive activities, maintain some level of control in adverse conditions, and employ various sensors to ensure passenger safety.\n\nSelf-driving cars enable people to use their travel time more efficiently. This advantage is particularly valuable for those who spend hours commuting, as it allows them to accomplish work during the journey. One concern could be that drivers might become distracted and less alert if they need to intervene. However, as noted in an article, \"Some manufacturers hope to address this by incorporating in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over.\" This means that drivers can utilize these regulated systems without compromising safety; if an emergency arises, the car can deactivate these devices.\n\nThese vehicles are intelligent enough to recognize when it's necessary for passengers to assume control. This capability is crucial because it demonstrates that while cars handle routine driving conditions independently, they still afford human intervention when needed. According to another article: \"In 2013, BMW announced the development of 'Traffic Jam Assistant.' The car can manage driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph; special touch sensors ensure the driver maintains contact with the wheel. Indeed, none of the cars developed so far are entirely driverless.\" This indicates that should a vehicle encounter challenging conditions or begin losing control, passengers have the ability\u2014and responsibility\u2014to take over.\n\nModified self-driving cars are equipped with advanced technology designed for optimal performance and safety.

However, the face is just another one of Mars' mesas or buttes.",
        "\"Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" Studying Venus is a worthwhile task despite the dangers that it involves. There are many positive things that may come out of exploring our dear neighbor Venus, including how it might have once been similar to Earth.\n\nResearchers have found many Earth-like pieces of evidence to support the claim that Venus was once like Earth. Venus may have been filled with oceans, similar to Earth. This planet may have hosted various forms of life, no matter how small. Today, there is still much evidence that suggests it once had an Earth-like atmosphere, such as rocky sediments, valleys, and mountains. By pursuing Venus, we can build upon our knowledge of Earth and explore the similarities in structures. Venus also boasts volcanoes and earthquakes, phenomena that Earth shares, making it intriguing to investigate Venus's Earth-like past.\n\nVenus is a promising pursuit, as it is a neighboring planet, allowing for relatively easy travel. Visiting Venus would be the closest planetary option, as no spacecraft has touched it in three decades. A revisit to Venus would be a significant advancement, given Venus's comparable size and density to Earth, offering a glimpse of Earth-like conditions, albeit hotter and with a more extreme troposphere.\n\nAdvancements in technology could enable successful spacecraft landings on Venus, paving the way for further technological growth. NASA, for instance, is developing electronics that can withstand Venus's extreme temperatures, potentially allowing for longer, more insightful missions. This, in turn, would offer a deeper understanding of Venus, drawing parallels to Earth, and showcasing the capabilities of technology, a crucial aspect of this pursuit.\n\nIn conclusion, the journey to Venus, though challenging, is, without a doubt, a worthwhile endeavor.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nOn May 24, 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured images of an intriguing landform on Mars that resembled a human face. NASA shared these images with the public a few days later, sparking widespread interest in Mars exploration. While some conspiracy theorists claimed this was evidence of alien life being concealed by NASA, this interpretation is illogical\u2014if NASA were hiding something, they wouldn't have released the photos at all. Scientists and astronauts have consistently refuted these theories through transparent documentation, clear photo captions, and follow-up imaging missions.\n\nAccording to the source material, NASA discovered the face-like formation in Mars' Cydonia region, which some thought resembled an Egyptian pharaoh. Mission control viewed it as merely a Martian mesa creating unusual shadows and readily shared the images with the media, confident there was nothing extraterrestrial about it. NASA explicitly captioned the image as a \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,\" clearly stating its natural origins. Even NASA budget advocates acknowledged their wish for evidence of ancient civilizations on Mars, implicitly confirming no such evidence existed. Conclusively, when another NASA spacecraft revisited Cydonia on April 5, 1998, it captured higher-resolution images that confirmed the formation was purely geological in nature.\n\nIn conclusion, NASA has been fully transparent about the \"Face on Mars.\" They simply discovered an interesting natural formation with shadow patterns that created a face-like illusion and shared it with the public. Their actions\u2014releasing the images, providing clear explanations in captions, and conducting follow-up imaging\u2014demonstrate complete openness rather than concealment.",
        "The Face is not an alien-made artifact, as NASA scientists conducted research and multiple trips to observe the land formation. Initially, NASA cameras did not provide clear evidence of any anomalies. A revisit 18 years later yielded more photographs, revealing no signs of alien involvement in the creation of the landform.\n\nAt NASA, scientists identified the formation as another Martian mesa, common in that region of Mars. They determined that the rock showed no indication of alien life, past or present. The large rock formation created an illusion of the Face when casting a shadow. Subsequent images in the summer of 1998 conclusively proved the large rock formation's natural origin.\n\nContrary to speculation, the Face is not of alien origin, as NASA scientists confirmed that the landform merely projected a shadow resembling a face. Due to the limitations of the Viking 1 cameras, the presence of any foreign entities was difficult to ascertain. With the advancement of technology, the follow-up images taken 18 years later provided clearer evidence, supporting the scientists' conclusion that the Face was a natural formation, devoid of alien involvement.",
        "Let me help restructure this text to improve its flow and clarity. Here's a revised version:\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" has sparked numerous debates about its origin, though scientific evidence points to it being a natural formation rather than an alien creation. While some conspiracy theories suggest extraterrestrial involvement, these claims lack substantive evidence.\n\nWhen researchers at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) analyzed detailed images of the formation, they confirmed it was simply a natural landform. This conclusion is supported by comparisons to similar geological features found on Earth. As Garvin notes in the article, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" explaining that it's \"a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n\nThe existence of comparable formations on Earth, particularly in the American West, provides strong evidence for natural geological processes being responsible for the Martian feature. If aliens had created the Face on Mars, it would be difficult to explain why it so closely resembles naturally occurring formations on Earth.\n\nFurthermore, there is no scientific evidence supporting the existence of aliens, while there is abundant evidence for natural geological processes creating similar formations across different planets.",
        "The use of this new technology to read emotions has a lot of potential for various applications. It can detect emotions accurately, even if someone is faking a smile or a frown. Employing this technology to assess the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is beneficial, as it can enhance their learning experience, make learning more enjoyable, and address any internal or external conflicts they may be facing.\n\nThis innovative technology has the capacity to positively impact numerous individuals, particularly students. By recognizing students' emotional states, teachers can gauge the overall mood of the class and offer support to uplift the students. Additionally, it can identify signs of stress or worry in students, enabling teachers to adjust their approach and provide appropriate guidance. It is akin to the notion that a person can interpret a friend's emotions by simply observing their facial expressions. If a teacher is aware of a student's stress or worry, they can adjust their teaching methods or deadlines accordingly.\n\nThis technology can transform students' learning experiences and can make the classroom a more engaging environment. If a student is disinterested or struggling in a particular subject, the technology can detect their emotions and alert the teacher, prompting adjustments to the lesson to better engage the student. This can lead to a more personalized and effective teaching approach, similar to the adaptability of a skilled human instructor, as the article highlights. \n\nFurthermore, the utilization of this technology to read emotional expressions can help identify students at risk of dangerous behavior, such as bullying, self-harm, or school shootings, and provide the necessary intervention. The ability to differentiate between a genuine and a forced smile can help to identify students in distress, potentially preventing harmful actions. \n\nIn a broader context, the implementation of this technology can greatly benefit schools worldwide, revolutionizing the learning process, promoting student well-being, and preventing risky behaviors.

A 1976 image of a Martian mesa, taken by the Viking 1 orbiter, appeared to some as a face, sparking speculation about alien civilizations.  However, this resemblance is purely coincidental, a trick of light and shadow captured by a relatively low-resolution camera.  Subsequent images taken in 2001 with significantly improved technology confirmed the formation to be a natural geological feature, a mesa, not unlike those found on Earth.\n\nJust as a random chip might resemble a face or clouds might mimic animals, the initial \"Face on Mars\" image invited pareidolia\u2014the tendency to see meaningful patterns in random data.  We often have to look twice at something to confirm what we think we see, highlighting the difference between perception and reality.  Magic tricks, for instance, create illusions that appear real but are based on deception. Similarly, the \"face\" on Mars was an illusion created by the limitations of the early imaging technology.\n\nThe argument for alien construction of the \"face\" lacks evidence.  It's akin to claiming humans built the Grand Canyon or the Rocky Mountains.  These natural formations are products of geological processes, just like the mesa on Mars.  Without proof of alien existence, let alone their involvement, the natural explanation, supported by clear photographic evidence, remains the most plausible.\n\nThe idea of aliens sculpting this Martian mesa is ultimately a circular argument.  While speculation is intriguing, it lacks the factual basis that readily supports the geological explanation. The \"Face on Mars\" serves as a reminder that while initial appearances can be deceiving, a closer look, informed by better data, often reveals a simpler, more grounded truth.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Face on Mars: A Natural Formation\n\nThe distinctive face-like landform discovered on Mars is, in my assessment, a natural geological formation rather than an artificial structure. While it undeniably resembles a face with eyes, nose, and mouth, attributing its creation to extraterrestrial beings is unwarranted.\n\nMany scientists have speculated about artificial origins, particularly extraterrestrial involvement, but this hypothesis lacks substantial evidence. The reasoning against artificial construction is compelling:\n\n1. **Lack of Evidence for Extraterrestrial Life**: We have yet to confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life, making it premature to attribute this formation to alien architects. Scientific discourse should be grounded in verifiable evidence rather than speculation.\n\n2. **Technical Complexity**: The construction of such a massive, face-like structure would require advanced technological capabilities. The precision and scale involved make manual construction implausible, even for a hypothetically advanced civilization.\n\n3. **Documented Changes**: Photographic evidence over the years reveals gradual changes in the formation's appearance. These alterations are consistent with natural weathering processes, including:\n   - Wind erosion\n   - Precipitation effects\n   - Seismic activity\n\nThe transformation of the formation over time strongly suggests the ongoing influence of natural geological processes rather than artificial construction.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports a natural origin for the Mars face formation. Until concrete evidence of extraterrestrial life emerges, attributing such geological features to alien activity remains purely speculative.",
        "Driverless cars are a fascinating development, and I believe they could have both positive and negative impacts. On the positive side, they could significantly reduce the amount of fuel being used, which would be better for the environment. With fewer cars on the road, we might see less pollution, allowing us to enjoy the earth more. For instance, by 2020, I hope to see less smoke in the air, which could encourage more people to explore the world. Driverless cars could make travel more enjoyable, allowing passengers to sit back, look out the window, and appreciate the journey, much like they did when they were children.  \n\nHowever, the downsides of driverless cars shouldn't be overlooked. One concern, as the article mentions, is the potential boredom people might feel from not being able to drive. Driving, for many, is an enjoyable, freeing, and even fun activity, and the thought of handing over control to a computer can feel, to some, like the loss of a meaningful, human experience.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text, enhancing its logical flow while maintaining its core message about educational technology:\n\n**The Revolutionary Impact of Adaptive Learning Technology**\n\nEducational technology is evolving in remarkable ways, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance student learning experiences. While still in its early stages, this innovative technology has the potential to transform traditional classroom dynamics fundamentally.\n\nOne of the most promising features is the system's ability to recognize students' emotional states. As the article notes, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" Since \"most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,\" this technology can interpret subtle cues that even teachers might miss, allowing for real-time adjustments to learning materials.\n\nThis capability addresses a common challenge in education: the difficulty of monitoring and responding to each student's comprehension level simultaneously. When a computer can detect confusion or disengagement, it can automatically modify the difficulty level of assignments, either simplifying content for struggling students or providing more challenging material for those who have mastered the basics.\n\nThe data collected through this system proves crucial for educational development. Teachers can access detailed insights about their students' learning patterns, identifying areas where additional support might be needed. This creates a more responsive and personalized learning environment, where interventions can be made before students fall behind.\n\nBy providing this level of individualized attention and adaptive learning, the technology serves as a valuable tool for both teachers and students. It doesn't replace human instruction but rather enhances it, ensuring that each student receives the appropriate level of challenge and support.",
        "I believe this technology holds significant value in reading students' emotions, and I have strong reasons to support this view.\n\nFirstly, it could be used to discern hidden emotions.  For example, when delivering a presentation, it's difficult to gauge the audience's true feelings. People often offer polite praise rather than expressing their genuine thoughts. This technology, however, could provide data-driven insights into audience reception, allowing presenters to assess the effectiveness of their presentations more accurately.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n**The Dangers of Driverless Cars: A Critical Analysis**\n\nHave you ever been in a car accident or come close to one? Do you remember whether it was your fault? What if it wasn't? While there has been considerable discussion about driverless cars, these vehicles still require driver assistance. They could potentially cause numerous accidents\u2014but who would be at fault? If you were in one of these \"driverless\" cars, you would still be accountable for any damage because you're expected to remain alert while riding in the vehicle. The development of driverless cars should cease for three key reasons: they still require human assistance, they aren't truly safe, and they diminish driver alertness.\n\nDriverless cars aren't what they appear to be\u2014they're essentially false advertising since human intervention is still necessary. According to research, these vehicles struggle with basic tasks like navigating through traffic or pulling out of driveways\u2014precisely the complex maneuvers where assistance would be most valuable. While the technology aims to mimic human driving skills, what drivers truly need isn't another human-like operator but rather advanced technology that eliminates human error. Furthermore, these vehicles face significant limitations on highways: in the event of an accident, an inattentive driver wouldn't be able to respond to the situation, and the car cannot independently plan alternative routes. While driverless cars perform better on \"smart roads,\" not all roads are equipped with this technology. This poses particular challenges for people living in congested cities or areas with frequent construction.\n\nConsider the liability implications: who would be responsible for injuries resulting from a driverless car accident? Google, the primary developer of this technology, has implemented safety features such as vibrating seats and flashing windshield displays. However, these alerts prove ineffective if the driver falls asleep. More concerning is the potential for drivers to develop dangerous habits: after becoming accustomed to a driverless car's assistance, they might mistakenly assume they can be less attentive when operating traditional vehicles.",
        "Venus is often referred to as Earth's sister planet or \"Earth's twin\" due to its similar density and size in comparison to Earth. Scientists have made attempts to explore Venus using small robots, but these robots only survived for a few hours on its surface. Venus is believed to have been similar to Earth in the past, possibly covered in oceans, green life, and other forms of life before Earth. Scientists are reluctant to physically visit Venus due to the extreme dangers they would encounter. Venus's atmosphere is composed of a thick layer of almost 97% carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, temperatures soaring to at least 800 degrees, and an atmospheric pressure 90 times higher than Earth's.\n\nThe author suggests that scientists should overcome the challenges to explore Venus up close to gain valuable insights. Despite the risks, the opportunity to study Venus firsthand could provide unique and valuable information. Exploration should not be limited by the dangers involved, but should instead push the boundaries of imagination and innovation to uncover the mysteries of Venus.",
        "Using technology that reads emotions in a classroom setting offers numerous benefits. It can calculate emotions, recognize subtle facial movements, and mirror suggested emotions. According to the text, the software identifies mixed emotions by analyzing different units. For example, when applied to the Mona Lisa, it determined that she appeared 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry, at least according to the software. The software can also recognize subtle facial movements, such as when you smile at an ad, prompting the computer to send similar ads, or when you frown, leading the computer to change the ad. This capability can greatly benefit students, as the software can detect when a student becomes bored, allowing the lesson to be adapted, similar to the actions of an effective human instructor.",
        "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" presents a compelling idea, but I argue against the development and use of driverless cars due to significant safety and cost concerns.  The potential for malfunction is a major deterrent.  What happens if a driverless car malfunctions while the driver is not paying attention?  Will the company take responsibility, replace the vehicle, or cover the costs associated with an accident?  This lack of clear accountability makes the prospect of owning a driverless car unsettling.  Furthermore, relying on technology that is inherently prone to malfunctioning, especially in a vehicle, is inherently risky.\n\nThe exorbitant cost of driverless cars further exacerbates the issue.  Ranging into the millions of dollars, these vehicles are financially inaccessible to the average person.  While the wealthy and famous may afford such a luxury, the vast majority will be priced out.  This creates a disparity where basic, reliable transportation remains affordable while advanced, autonomous vehicles are reserved for the elite.  Why invest in such expensive technology when reliable, albeit less technologically advanced, vehicles are readily available?\n\nProponents argue that driverless cars offer the convenience of hands-free driving. However, this argument is flawed.  Drivers are still required to monitor the vehicle and intervene when alerts arise.  The idea that someone could safely and responsibly use their phone while the car is in operation is ludicrous.  It promotes distracted driving and negates the supposed benefit of autonomous operation.  If one needs to be available by phone, it's far safer and more responsible to simply wait until arriving at one's destination.\n\nMoreover, the fundamental premise of a \"driverless\" car is undermined by the necessity of constant monitoring.",
        "Many car companies are working on driverless cars, a highly debatable topic with numerous pros and cons. Some believe that these cars have the potential to change the world. While driverless cars might make life easier by allowing people to relax and not pay attention to the road, there are significant drawbacks to consider. \n\nFor instance, when a teenager first gets their license, navigating their surroundings in a regular car helps them become familiar with their environment. If they relied solely on a driverless car, they might not pay attention to where they are going, and a malfunction could leave them disoriented. Moreover, in the event of an accident, determining fault could become complex and contentious.\n\nDespite the enticing idea of driverless cars, I believe the concept is unnecessary, and the resources dedicated to their development could be put to better use.",
        "Here's a logically restructured and edited version of the text, improving flow and coherence while correcting spelling and grammatical errors:\n\n**Exploring Venus: Weighing the Risks and Scientific Value**\n\nDespite Venus being one of the most hostile environments in our solar system, scientists remain intrigued by its potential for exploration. The planet presents extraordinary challenges: clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid shroud its atmosphere, surface temperatures soar above 800 degrees, and atmospheric pressure reaches 90 times that of Earth. As noted in the text, \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.\"\n\nWhat makes Venus particularly compelling to astronomers is its possible history as the most \"Earth-like\" planet in our solar system. However, current technological limitations severely restrict our ability to study it. Even remote observation proves challenging, as \"peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.\"\n\nYet the author argues that such obstacles shouldn't deter exploration. They draw a parallel to other dangerous endeavors humans undertake daily, noting that \"human curiosity will likely lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors.\"",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text:\n\n**The Privacy and Ethical Concerns of Emotional Recognition Technology in Education**\n\nUsing emotional recognition technology in classrooms represents a significant violation of students' fundamental rights to privacy and personal space. While the technology can create detailed 3D models of faces and analyze 44 facial muscles to detect emotions, this capability raises serious ethical concerns in an educational setting.\n\nThe process itself is inefficient and disruptive to learning. Creating 3D facial models and performing complex calculations isn't instantaneous\u2014it requires valuable classroom time that should be spent on actual instruction and test preparation. Moreover, emotions are dynamic, changing frequently throughout the day, making such measurements potentially meaningless shortly after they're taken.\n\nConsider how we naturally handle emotional situations: when a friend is upset, we might notice their expression and gently ask if they're okay. If they prefer not to discuss it, we respect their privacy and give them space. Using technology to forcibly decode someone's emotional state contradicts this basic human courtesy. Unlike the Mona Lisa, which is a static painting unable to consent to emotional analysis, students are living individuals with the right to choose how and when they express their feelings.\n\nThe classroom should remain a space for learning, not a laboratory for emotional surveillance. While emotional recognition technology might have legitimate applications in medical settings or specialized fields, its implementation in schools would compromise student privacy and autonomy.",
        "I believe that using technology to read students' emotional expressions is valuable. It would be incredible to discern someone's emotions through a machine, as it provides significant insight into what a person is feeling, which is crucial to know. There are many excellent and well-reasoned examples of why this technology is valuable.\n\nOne reason I believe this technology is valuable is that it could help identify if someone is feeling depressed and is unwilling to open up to others, potentially preventing self-harm. If others know what that individual is feeling, they might be able to help. For instance, the passage states, \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused and bored.\" Dr. Huang says, \"then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This technology could be useful in many different situations, making it a valuable tool.\n\nThe creator of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), Dr. Paul Ekman, has classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technology can aid in solving worldwide problems. For example, if a student is struggling with a subject in school and is unsure how to ask for help, the computer could create a 3-D model of their face, analyze their emotions, and, subsequently, provide the necessary assistance.\n\nAnother important application is in the realm of crime, where reading emotions is crucial.",
        "The article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" explores various theories about the mysterious formation on the Martian surface. The most logical explanation is that the \"face\" is merely a natural landform. The article highlights how the more sensational, conspiracy-driven theories are not supported by NASA, which has conducted extensive research on the subject.\n\nThe article includes photographs from the years 1976, 1998, and 2001, showing the formation's gradual appearance over time. These images, along with substantial research, confirm the structure is, indeed, just a mesa. Multiple studies and evidence support this conclusion, reinforcing the idea that the \"face\" is a natural landform.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, the Viking 1 spacecraft captured the likeness of a human face, a massive feature spanning nearly two miles. It was revealed to be a large rock formation, bearing a resemblance to a human head. Despite the evidence, some people doubted the explanation, suspecting a NASA cover-up, even though the agency provided ample research to the contrary.\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" has inspired films, books, magazines, and radio discussions, with some individuals preferring the idea of a hidden, more sensational, truth, despite the overwhelming evidence.",

        "Curiosity is a fundamental human drive, fueling our desire to explore, even in the face of danger or perceived impossibility.  \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" embodies this spirit, arguing for the value of studying Venus despite its extreme environment. The author effectively constructs this argument through several key strategies.\n\nFirst, the author establishes a foundation by highlighting Venus's similarities to Earth.  He notes that \"...Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,\" suggesting a compelling reason for NASA's interest.  He further acknowledges the history of attempted exploration, stating that \"...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world,\"  implicitly acknowledging the inherent challenges.\n\nNext, the author explores potential solutions, specifically referencing NASA's concept of a \"blimp-like\" vehicle.  He explains that such a vehicle, \"...hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\"  However, he also addresses the limitations of this approach, conceding that observations \"...far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions...\" and hinder sample collection. This inclusion of a counterargument strengthens his overall position by demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.\n\nFurthermore, the author effectively uses factual information and statistics (appealing to logos, rather than pathos) to bolster his claims, lending credibility to the feasibility of the proposed solutions.  For example, the specifics about the blimp and the data regarding Venus's density and size are presented as evidence to support his arguments.\n\nFinally, the author crafts a compelling conclusion that resonates beyond the specific context of Venus exploration.  He argues that \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\"",
        "A new technology, known as the Facial Action Coding System, enables computers to recognize human emotions. This system has potential applications in fields such as psychology, art, and acting. However, while reading human emotions can be advantageous in certain areas, it offers limited value in the classroom setting. This is due to the diversity in student learning styles, the essential role of human teachers, and the high costs that outweigh the few benefits it might provide.\n\nAccording to the article, Dr. Huang predicts that this technology could allow computers to detect when a student is confused or bored, adjusting the lesson accordingly. Although this seems beneficial, the reality is that not all students learn in the same way. A lesson that some students grasp easily might confuse others. Modifying the lesson to accommodate the confused students could, in turn, bore the ones who already understand, necessitating further adjustments. While the Facial Action Coding System can interpret emotions, it cannot cater to the unique needs of each student. Furthermore, the presence of a computer as the primary instructor in the classroom is, in itself, not ideal. Relying on computers as teachers could lead to the unemployment of human educators, radically alter the education system, and, potentially, bore students.",
        "The authors present compelling arguments for continuing our efforts to land on Venus, suggesting that it could yield significant scientific and technological advances. However, I disagree with their perspective. I believe landing on Venus is not advisable at this time due to the immense risks and the planet's inhospitable conditions. Venus is not a habitable place, and the dangers involved are too great, as not many people would want to risk their lives on such a mission.\n\nThe article outlines several reasons why some believe we should attempt to land on Venus despite the dangers. One argument is the potential to develop suits that can withstand the planet's extreme heat, which reaches around 170 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the article notes that Venus may have once been an Earth-like planet, possibly harboring life, which could provide invaluable insights into the history of our solar system. Furthermore, the mission could result in a technological leap, advancing our capabilities in space exploration.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are significant dangers associated with visiting Venus, organizations like NASA and other space agencies are willing to take the risk to uncover the planet's secrets.",

As demonstrated by recent developments, these vehicles could revolutionize our transportation system, but important considerations must be addressed before they become commonplace.\n\n**Current Technology and Features**\nBMW's \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" exemplifies the current state of autonomous technology. This system allows vehicles to steer, accelerate, and brake independently at speeds up to 25 mph, though drivers must keep their hands on the wheel. The technology includes sophisticated safety features, such as in-car entertainment and information systems that automatically deactivate when human intervention is required.\n\n**Major Challenges**\n\n1. Cost Barriers\n   - Radar systems can cost up to $200 million\n   - High initial investment for manufacturers and consumers\n\n2. Legal Obstacles\n   - Most states currently prohibit testing of fully autonomous vehicles\n   - Laws prioritize human control for safety reasons\n   - Liability questions remain unresolved (manufacturer vs. driver responsibility)\n\n**Potential Benefits**\n\n1. Efficiency and Convenience\n   - Reduced fuel consumption (potentially half of current taxi usage)\n   - More flexible than traditional public transportation\n   - Navigation optimization for faster travel times\n\n2. Practical Applications\n   - Assistance during long-distance travel\n   - Automated navigation in traffic\n   - Enhanced safety features\n\n**Looking Forward**\nWhile driverless cars face significant hurdles, particularly regarding cost and legislation, their potential benefits suggest a promising future. Once manufacturers can develop vehicles that meet safety requirements and regulatory standards, widespread adoption seems likely. The technology requires further refinement, but the foundation for autonomous transportation is being laid today.\n\nThe transition to driverless vehicles will depend on overcoming both technical and regulatory challenges while demonstrating clear benefits to consumers. As these obstacles are addressed, autonomous vehicles may indeed become an integral part of our daily transportation system.",
        "Many people believe that the \"face\" on Mars is an actual face or that it was created by aliens. However, it has been convincingly proven that it is not an actual face. First, it is a rock. Second, the angle of the camera captured the shadow in such a way that it seemed like a face. Third, the idea that it was a face was perpetuated for marketing purposes.\n\nMy first reason is that it is simply a rock on Mars. As stated in paragraph three, it is a large rock formation that resembles a human head. This is a clear indication that it is just a rock. Over the years, the rock has weathered, developing more crevices, and is losing the semblance of a face. If a real face were buried there, it would not lose its form so easily.\n\nMy second reason is the angle at which the camera captured the rock. The shadow it cast created the illusion of a face. A better angle would have shown that there was nothing significant. Additionally, examining the surrounding area, you would find many similar rock formations on Mars. It is also suggested that the resolution of the camera may have contributed. If the technology we have today had been available when the rock was first discovered, the image would have been clearer, revealing the rock's true appearance.\n\nMy final reason is the marketing aspect. The face theory was perpetuated because it generated interest and publicity. It was a strategic move, as the theory was featured in Hollywood, books, magazines, and even radio, thereby promoting NASA.",
        "In \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author raises valid points about using technology to interpret facial expressions and gauge moods. However, applying this technology to read students' facial expressions is excessive.  I believe this technology could pressure students to feign expressions, particularly smiles, to mask their true feelings. This essay will outline my concerns regarding this technology's potential negative impact.\n\nWhile the author presents a compelling topic, the implications of constant surveillance are troubling.  The example of smiling at a web ad influencing future ads is misleading. Ad delivery relies on complex algorithms, not simply reactive responses to facial expressions.  Students shouldn't feel compelled to manage their expressions for a computer's interpretation.  This \"new technology\" risks distorting self-perception, and I object to children feeling monitored and judged based on computer-interpreted facial expressions.\n\nThe author's perspective, while thought-provoking, lacks broader consideration.  Many parents would be uncomfortable with technology scrutinizing their children's faces to assess their emotional state.  Furthermore, this technology relies solely on external displays.  It cannot discern internal feelings that contradict outward expressions.  We often mask true emotions with neutral expressions.  Computers see only the surface, not the complex reality of human emotion. Therefore, I believe using technology to interpret students' emotional expressions should be abandoned.",

        "### Restructured Text:  \n\nDriverless cars, once considered a fantasy, have now made a name for themselves in both popular culture and real-world development. While many of us have seen them in movies, they are no longer just fictional gadgets. These autonomous vehicles are being tested for human use, and their arrival seems imminent. Driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation, not only by reducing accidents but by offering a range of additional benefits.  \n\nThe most compelling argument for driverless cars is their potential to improve safety. Humans, by nature, are prone to making mistakes, which often lead to accidents. Autonomous vehicles, powered by advanced technology, can eliminate human error. Companies like Google, BMW, and GM are at the forefront, actively testing these cars, though they have yet to be released for public use. Test drives have already shown promising results, indicating that driverless cars may soon be able to take over the responsibility of accident prevention.  \n\nIn addition to safety, the convenience of driverless cars cannot be overstated. Imagine being able to use your commute for other tasks, like preparing for work, eating, or even catching up on emails, without worrying about the road. For people who are constantly rushing, a driverless car could, quite literally, save their day.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved flow and coherence:\n\n# The Case Against Driverless Cars\n\n## Introduction\nI believe that driverless cars are an accident waiting to happen. Proponents argue that autonomous vehicles would use half the fuel of today's cars, offer more flexibility, and provide enhanced safety. However, these arguments are fundamentally flawed for several reasons.\n\n## Cost Concerns\nDespite claims that driverless cars would be more economical, the reality is quite different. These vehicles require extensive and expensive technology:\n- Position estimating sensors\n- Rotating roof sensors\n- Video cameras near the rearview mirror\n- Four automotive radar sensors\n- GPS receiver\n- Internal motion sensor\n\nThe initial purchase price and ongoing maintenance costs far exceed those of conventional vehicles. Traditional cars only require basic maintenance and fuel, making them significantly more cost-effective for the average consumer.\n\n## Limited Flexibility\nContrary to claims about increased flexibility, autonomous vehicles actually offer less freedom than conventional cars. With a manual vehicle, drivers have complete control over their route and destination. Driverless cars rely heavily on GPS navigation, which presents significant limitations:\n- Cannot access unmapped roads\n- Restricted to pre-programmed routes\n- Less adaptable to unexpected situations\n\n## Safety Concerns\nThe safety arguments for driverless cars are particularly problematic. Promoters cite benefits such as:\n- \"Driving in a fun new way\"\n- In-car entertainment options\n- Ability to text while driving\n\nThese supposed advantages actually highlight serious safety concerns. The fact remains that these vehicles still require human oversight, and encouraging distracting activities like entertainment and texting could lead to dangerous situations. If a driver is distracted when the system requires human intervention, the consequences could be fatal.\n\n## Conclusion\nDriverless cars should remain in the realm of science fiction. The combination of:\n- Prohibitive costs\n- Limited flexibility\n- Significant safety risks\n- Reliability concerns\n\nMakes them an impractical and potentially dangerous alternative to conventional vehicles. We should continue to rely on traditional, manually operated cars rather than pursuing this flawed technology.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Facial Action Coding System in Education: A Critical Analysis\n\nThe Facial Action Coding System (FACS) represents a significant advancement in science and technology, but its implementation in school computers warrants careful consideration. While this technology offers potential benefits in educational settings, it also presents notable challenges.\n\nAccording to Nick D'Alto's article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" integrating FACS into school computers could help identify when students struggle with lessons and automatically adjust content to support their learning. Let's examine both the advantages and disadvantages of this technology.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe primary advantage of implementing FACS in educational computers lies in its ability to read students' facial expressions and determine their level of comprehension. This real-time feedback could enable dynamic lesson adjustments, potentially improving student understanding and learning outcomes.\n\n## Challenges\n\n### Limited Applicability\nNot all schools rely heavily on digital learning. While some institutions embrace e-learning\u2014where students complete coursework entirely on school-issued computers\u2014many still primarily utilize traditional teaching methods. FACS would prove most beneficial in e-learning environments but might offer limited value in schools that primarily conduct face-to-face instruction.\n\n### Financial Considerations\nThe implementation costs of FACS raise important questions:\n- What is the system's cost?\n- Can schools justify this additional expense?\n- Is this investment necessary given that schools have functioned effectively without such technology?\n\nStudents already have various resources available, including teacher assistance and internet access, to help them understand challenging concepts.",

There was much anticipation to see the image of the face.\n\nAt NASA, some speculated that aliens had created the face as evidence of life on Mars. It seemed implausible for a random face to appear without reason; it must have been intentional by someone or something. However, others argued it could be a natural landform, although this notion seemed far-fetched considering the unusual circumstances.\n\nIn truth, after further investigation, it was confirmed that the face was merely a natural land formation. Some skeptics accused NASA of concealing the true origins of the feature. There were hopes among budget supporters for an ancient civilization on Mars to explain its existence definitively.\n\nUsing specialized cameras revealed intricate details in photographs. The image displayed what experts identified as a lava dome resembling an isolated mesa similar in height to the mysterious face on Mars.\n\nInitially perceived as an alien monument or indicator of life on Mars, extensive research eventually clarified that it was indeed a natural land formation. The confusion arose from its unexpected appearance on the planet's surface. Despite efforts to uncover hidden markings and decipher its significance amidst haze and speculation, ultimately, it proved to be nothing more than a peculiar yet ordinary geological structure misinterpreted by many.",

However, as more evidence was gathered, including photos taken on a cloudless day, it became clear that the face was a result of a natural, albeit striking, land formation, not a man-made structure, as was once believed.\n\nThe illusion of a face, created by the shadows, was a compelling, albeit deceptive, image, leading many to question the reality of the face on Mars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",
        "Venus is a fascinating planet worthy of study, offering valuable insights and knowledge.  Its proximity and similarities to Earth make it a particularly compelling subject.  While often overlooked, Venus is the closest planet to us in terms of size and density, making it practically Earth's twin.\n\nHowever, despite this proximity, Venus presents significant challenges for exploration.  As noted, its reputation as a difficult planet to study is well-earned.  The incredibly hot temperatures make it the hottest planet in our solar system, and the atmospheric pressure far exceeds that of Earth. These extreme conditions create a hostile environment for human exploration.\n\nDespite these challenges, studying Venus can illuminate much about planetary evolution.  Paragraph 4 highlights this by referring to Venus as our \"sister planet\" and pondering why it became so inhospitable.  Evidence suggests that Venus once possessed vast oceans, much like Earth.  Even now, it shares similar geological features with our planet, including valleys, mountains, and craters.  Understanding how Venus evolved so differently from Earth, despite their initial similarities, is crucial for our understanding of planetary science.\n\nLearning about Venus reveals both its differences and similarities to Earth, making it an intriguing area of study.  While many people may be unfamiliar with the specifics of this planet, its relative closeness and unique characteristics make it a prime candidate for continued exploration and research.",
        "I am totally against driverless cars and believe that production on these vehicles should be halted. There are already significant issues being encountered with these vehicles, as seen in the example in the second paragraph where it is mentioned that driverless cars struggle to operate or maneuver through traffic, roadblocks, accidents, etc.\n\nIf adverse weather conditions or natural disasters such as storms, tornadoes, or earthquakes occur, will the driverless cars be able to navigate effectively? If the driver needs to intervene in such situations, it defeats the purpose of having a driverless car. Drivers should always stay alert and focused, whether driving or not, to ensure safety, as unforeseen events can always occur. A computer may not possess the acuity or qualifications to think, act, or make decisions like a human driver.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of an accident or injury, the question of fault, as discussed in paragraphs 9 and 7, becomes a significant issue, with the argument of whether the driver or the manufacturer is to blame.

        "The \"Face on Mars\" captivated public imagination, not for its geological significance, but because its initial low-resolution photograph, with its peculiar shadows, resembled a humanoid face.  This sparked speculation about alien structures and past life on the planet.  Many interpreted the image as evidence of an ancient Martian civilization, while skeptics demanded proof that it was a natural formation.  NASA, driven by the controversy, embarked on a mission to capture higher resolution images of the enigmatic landform.\n\nAs NASA obtained increasingly detailed photographs, the \"Face\" gradually revealed itself to be a mesa, a common geological feature in the region.  The improved resolution silenced most doubters, drawing comparisons to similar formations on Earth, such as Middle Butte in Idaho, definitively not of alien origin.  The scientific consensus solidified around the explanation that the \"Face\" was merely an optical illusion, a trick of light and shadow.\n\nWhile the initial controversy fueled excitement about the possibility of life on Mars, the subsequent evidence overwhelmingly pointed towards a natural explanation.",

The original 1976 image captured by Viking showed what appeared to be a human-like face, created by shadows casting the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth on a huge rock formation.\n\nTo investigate this phenomenon further, scientists captured new images in 2001 using significantly improved technology. The new camera offered remarkable clarity, with each pixel spanning just 1.56 meters compared to the Viking photo's 43 meters per pixel. This enhanced resolution was so detailed that, had there been any artificial structures like pyramids, airplanes, or even small shacks, they would have been clearly visible.\n\nWhat did these higher-resolution images reveal? Rather than showing evidence of alien construction, they demonstrated that the formation is simply the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - a natural geological structure common on both Earth and Mars.\n\nIn conclusion, what sparked years of speculation and debate turned out to be the work of nature rather than extraterrestrial architects. The \"face\" was merely an illusion created by shadows falling across a natural rock formation, demonstrating how easily our eyes can find familiar patterns in random shapes - a phenomenon known as pareidolia.\n\n*Note: I've corrected spelling and grammatical errors, improved sentence structure, and organized the information in a more logical flow while maintaining the original content and message.*",

While the formation does bear a resemblance to a human face, this effect is created by natural rock formations and shadows, not alien architects.\n\nNASA has thoroughly documented this phenomenon through increasingly detailed imagery. Initial photos taken at 43 meters per pixel, compared with newer high-resolution images at 1.56 meters per pixel, both confirm the same conclusion: we're looking at a natural geological formation. The face-like appearance is merely a result of light and shadow playing across the Martian landscape.\n\nThough this formation has captured public imagination for over 25 years\u2014appearing in movies, books, magazines, and radio talk shows\u2014it's crucial to separate entertainment from scientific fact. Just as we shouldn't believe everything we hear about celebrities, we shouldn't accept sensational claims without scientific evidence.\n\nSeveral key points refute the alien construction theory:\n\n- Mars has shown no evidence of current or recent life forms\n- NASA, which openly shares its discoveries, would have no reason to hide such a monumental finding\n- The formation's appearance changes significantly under different lighting conditions\n- Geological processes can explain the formation's characteristics\n\nThe Face on Mars serves as a reminder that while conspiracy theories can be compelling, they often crumble under scientific scrutiny.

        "Emotions are a fundamental part of the human experience, ranging from the heights of joy to the depths of despair.  Scientists like Dr. Paul Ekman have dedicated their careers to understanding these complex emotions.  Dr. Ekman's groundbreaking work led to the development of FACS (Facial Action Coding System), a sophisticated technology that analyzes facial expressions to interpret emotions.\n\nThe human face, with its intricate network of 44 major muscles, serves as a canvas for emotional expression. These muscles, capable of a vast repertoire of movements, communicate not only emotions but also a myriad of other facial activities. FACS, a 3-D computer-based program, leverages this intricate muscle system to identify and categorize emotions. Dr. Ekman identified six basic emotions \u2013 happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness \u2013 and meticulously mapped their corresponding facial muscle movements.  For instance, the frontalis pars lateralis muscle contracts when we raise our eyebrows in surprise, while the orbicularis oris muscle tightens our lips in anger.\n\nAs Dr. Huang notes, \"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\" although the intensity of these expressions can vary significantly among individuals.  This innovative emotion-recognition software uses video imagery to track subtle facial movements, offering exciting potential for applications in education.  Imagine a classroom where a computer, equipped with this technology, can discern a student's emotional state. By recognizing expressions of happiness, confusion, or boredom, the software could prompt the teacher to adjust the lesson accordingly, mirroring the responsiveness of a skilled human instructor.  This ability to personalize instruction based on real-time emotional feedback could revolutionize the classroom experience.\n\nA positive learning environment is crucial for student engagement and knowledge acquisition. A bright and stimulating classroom, both physically and emotionally, can significantly enhance a student's ability to learn and absorb information.",
        "The author argues that despite the dangers, exploring Venus is a worthwhile endeavor, although this assertion may be debatable. The author discusses the challenges posed by the extreme pressure and heat on Venus's surface which could prevent physical exploration. Additionally, the author suggests various methods for exploring our sister planet to provide us with perspective.\n\nThe discussion begins with a reflection on past unsuccessful missions to Venus due to its harsh conditions. The planet's atmosphere is comprised of nearly 97% carbon dioxide, and its clouds contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid. This hostile environment makes it challenging to navigate through just the atmosphere alone, let alone survive on its surface. With temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's, it seems almost impossible for humans to reach Venus's surface.\n\nFurthermore, the author poses a crucial question: why consider further visits to a planet as inhospitable as Venus? The suggestion is that perhaps in ancient times, Venus was similar to our current Earth with stable land masses and oceans teeming with life forms and vegetation. There are still observable similarities between Earth and Venus today such as rocky surfaces, valleys, mountains, and craters. This leads the author to advocate for a return mission in hopes of uncovering more evidence supporting this theory.\n\nDespite acknowledging the challenges of exploring Venus safely while maximizing scientific productivity, the author outlines NASA's proposal of using blimp-like vehicles as potential solutions. These vehicles would hover above Venus's surface shielding astronauts from its hostile conditions; however, even at an altitude of 30 miles above ground level where temperatures are around 170 degrees Fahrenheit would not be entirely safe for human exploration due to limited visibility caused by atmospheric conditions obstructing light penetration.\n\nIn summary, while there are promising suggestions for enabling exploration missions to reach Venus successfully; there exist substantial obstacles hindering manned aircraft from landing on its inhospitable terrain securely. Given these challenges, relying on unmanned spacecraft might be more feasible at present considering our current technological limitations in ensuring safe human travel back-and-forth from this unforgiving planet.",
        "Let me help restructure this text to improve its flow and clarity. Here's a revised version:\n\nThe Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions, offers valuable applications in educational settings. This technology can serve both students and teachers in different but meaningful ways.\n\nFrom a student's perspective, FACS can help individuals better understand and manage their emotional responses. Some students may struggle with emotional regulation\u2014whether it's being overly sensitive to criticism or having difficulty controlling anger. By using this technology to monitor their emotional states, students can track their reactions and work on developing more balanced responses. For instance, a student who tends to cry easily could use FACS to practice maintaining composure in challenging situations, while another who struggles with anger management could use it to recognize and moderate their reactions before conflicts arise.\n\nFrom an educator's standpoint, FACS can serve as a valuable tool for understanding students' emotional well-being. Teachers who care about their students' overall welfare can use this technology to identify when a student might be experiencing difficulties, whether academic or personal.

        "In 1976, an object resembling a human face was discovered on the planet Mars by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft as it orbited around Mars, capturing images for potential landing sites for Viking 2. This 'human head,' spanning two miles, captured attention as it appeared to gaze back at the cameras from a region on Mars known as Cydonia. The appearance of this 'Face' likely sparked surprise among mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.\n\nSoon after the unveiling of what appeared to be a 'human face,' the decision was made to reveal it to the public in order to generate interest in Mars. This move succeeded in drawing widespread attention, leading NASA to dub it \"Face on Mars,\" turning it into a global icon that featured in various media for over two decades.\n\nThe speculation surrounding this object on Mars reignited discussions about the possibility of life existing on the planet. Even after 18 years following the conclusion of the Viking missions when NASA's MGS arrived at Mars in September 1997, Cydonia remained a focal point for exploration efforts. Chief scientist Jim Garvin emphasized its importance and ensured that capturing images of the Face was prioritized during their mission.\n\nIn April 1998, MGS flew over Cydonia and produced an image ten times clearer than those taken by Viking, generating much anticipation among eager spectators awaiting its release. However, due to wispy clouds obstructing visibility, some were left wanting more clarity from this second look at the Face.\n\nSubsequent attempts were made by MGS to capture clearer images of the Face with improved resolution capabilities. In April 2001, a significant breakthrough occurred with an exceptional photo taken by Malin's team showing details comparable in size with landforms found in regions like America\u2019s Western states.\n\nDespite speculations about alien origins or structures linked to intelligent life forms on Mars associated with this enigmatic formation resembling a human head \u2013 further detailed examination revealed that shadows creating an illusionary resemblance played trickery upon observers\u2019 eyesight suggesting otherwise - hinting towards other natural geological explanations rather than extraterrestrial involvement.",

        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text about the Face on Mars:\n\nThe Face on Mars: Science vs. Speculation\n\nWhen NASA's Viking 1 discovered an intriguing Mars landform, it sparked two distinct interpretations: one grounded in science, the other in speculation. Some saw a pharaoh, a face, a man on Mars. Others went further, envisioning something more extraordinary: an alien, a Martian artifact deliberately carved into the planet's surface.\n\nScience. Scientific. Fact. These words should guide our understanding of this phenomenon. The reality is more straightforward than the conspiracies suggest. While the formation does possess face-like features\u2014thanks to natural patterns of light, shadow, and geological structures\u2014crucial details that would support artificial origin are absent. Most notably, there's no evidence of a body or surrounding architectural elements that one might expect from a deliberate construction.\n\nThe formation's appearance can be explained through natural processes. Mars's thick atmosphere, varying angles of sunlight, and the interplay of shadows create compelling illusions across its surface. What appears in photographs to be facial features are, in fact, the result of these environmental factors working on the planet's geology.\n\nConspiracy theorists, however, approach the formation differently. They seek to reshape perspectives, often twisting evidence to support their preferred narratives. While their interpretations may be creative, they frequently overlook fundamental scientific principles and geological facts.\n\nThe conclusion is clear: the Face on Mars is a landform\u2014a natural sculpture crafted by cosmic forces rather than alien architects. It stands as testament not to extraterrestrial intelligence but to the remarkable ability of natural processes to create seemingly meaningful patterns.\n\nYet perhaps there's room for both perspectives. While we must stand firm on scientific fact, we can appreciate why these formations capture human imagination. The Face on Mars serves as both a geological formation and a mirror for our endless fascination with the possibility of life beyond Earth.\n\nSome may wish to believe in more fantastic explanations, and perhaps that's okay\u2014as long as we remember where the line between fact and fantasy lies.",

However, it's important to consider that this idea requires time, money, and people willing to adopt it. There's also the peculiar aspect of determining who, or what, is actually doing the driving. Personally, I would only appreciate a driverless car if it could simply pull up to you. The idea of the car driving itself is interesting, but only if the car is empty. When I hear \"driverless cars,\" I envision something akin to an \"Uber\" where someone is driving you around. I find that notion to be a bit strange.",
        "The article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" attempts to argue that exploring Venus is worthwhile despite the inherent risks. However, the author undermines their own argument by presenting a more compelling case *against* Venusian exploration.  The inclusion of numerous drawbacks ultimately weakens the author's thesis and damages their overall argument.\n\nRight from the outset, the author highlights the dangers of Venus, stating that \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" and that \"not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.\" These statements immediately create a negative impression, suggesting the extreme difficulty and potential futility of such an endeavor.  Instead of inspiring interest, the author evokes fear and apprehension by emphasizing the planet's hostility.  Phrases like \"thick atmosphere,\" \"corrosive sulfuric acid,\" \"800 degrees Fahrenheit,\" and \"extreme\" further solidify this image of Venus as an inhospitable and dangerous world.\n\nWhile the author asserts that \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit,\" this argument lacks substantial support. The author provides little evidence to demonstrate the benefits of exploring Venus, offering significantly less detail compared to the extensive description of its dangers.  Consequently, the potential downsides\u2014death, wasted resources, and time\u2014seem to far outweigh any potential advantages.\n\nThe author's focus on the perilous conditions of Venus ultimately overshadows any arguments in favor of exploration.  The unlivable environment and hazardous atmosphere presented by the author inadvertently demonstrate that Venus is likely too dangerous to explore at present.  This ultimately leads the reader to conclude that the author fails to effectively support their thesis due to a lack of compelling evidence and a preponderance of counter-arguments.",

Due to these varying orbital velocities, Earth's proximity to Mars and Venus fluctuates over time.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is advocating for human missions to study Venus. NASA suggests that a possible solution to the hostile conditions on Venus's surface would be to conduct studies from floating platforms above the turbulent environment.\n\nStudying Venus presents significant challenges.

        "For years, car development has primarily focused on design and fuel efficiency, rather than driver assistance.  Given the significant role cars play in most people's daily lives, improving this frequently used machine is a logical step.  A key advancement is the development of autonomous vehicles. While the safety of this technology may initially concern some, car companies are committed to ensuring consumer safety. Though this innovation may face initial resistance, experts predict its eventual widespread adoption.\n\nAutonomous vehicles offer significant safety benefits.  Equipped with LIDAR technology, they react faster than humans, preventing accidents.  Furthermore, they adhere to speed limits, enhancing road safety.  Beyond safety, built-in GPS navigation optimizes routes for maximum efficiency.\n\nDespite these advantages, public apprehension is understandable.  This technology is relatively new, and unfamiliarity breeds concern.  Resistance to change is a common human trait, and the idea of a self-driving car represents a significant shift.  However, history demonstrates that initial resistance often gives way to acceptance.\n\nA primary concern revolves around accident liability. However, technological malfunction is statistically improbable.  Google's autonomous car testing program, for example, resulted in only one accident, which was attributed to human error, not the technology itself. Human error is far more frequent, and regulations will mandate comprehensive safety features in these vehicles.\n\nWhile the concept of autonomous vehicles may be initially daunting, experts foresee their normalization.  Public adoption will likely be gradual, and personal preference will dictate individual choices.  Availability doesn't necessitate universal adoption; the goal is to provide an option for those who desire it. Once the proficiency of safety measures is demonstrably established, there will be little reason to prevent this technology's presence on public roads.",

One of the key roles involved caring for horses, young cows, and mules during their overseas transport, including feeding them.  Shipboard life offered ample leisure time, filled with activities like baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and various games.  The experience also broadened horizons and fostered a sense of global awareness.\n\nLuke's travels with the Seagoing Cowboys instilled in him a deep appreciation for different cultures and their needs.

This car also proves to be dangerous in the sense of a malfunction. What happens when the car goes out of control and gets into a car accident? Whose fault is it, the driver of the \"driverless\" car for not paying attention and driving, or the car itself for not knowing how to drive.

        "Self-driving cars present a compelling idea, but I firmly believe they are not ready for widespread adoption.  Several critical safety concerns remain unaddressed.  One primary issue is the handover problem:  while these cars can handle many driving situations, they still require human intervention in others.  This creates a dangerous scenario where a driver, potentially disengaged after periods of automated driving, must suddenly react to a critical situation.  For example, if the car's sensors fail to detect a pedestrian crossing the street, the driver may not have enough time to react and prevent an accident. This raises a crucial legal and ethical question: who is responsible in such a case \u2013 the driver or the manufacturer?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this ambiguity surrounding liability creates a legal minefield. If an accident occurs, determining fault becomes complex. Is the driver responsible for not paying sufficient attention, even if they were relying on the car's automation?  Or is the manufacturer liable for flaws in the technology? This potential for legal battles between drivers and manufacturers further complicates the issue.  Additionally, the criminal implications are disturbing. Could a driver face charges for a fatality caused by the car's malfunction, even if they were technically following the rules of automated driving?\n\nFurthermore, the article I read about this technology did not mention any driver override system. This raises the alarming possibility that a driver, even if they see a hazard, might be unable to take control of the car in time to prevent an accident.  This lack of control in critical situations makes the prospect of self-driving cars even more risky.\n\nWhile some self-driving cars alert drivers to roadwork or other potential hazards through vibrating seats and flashing lights, the effectiveness of these alerts is questionable.",

        "Venus, the second planet from the sun, presents a formidable challenge for human exploration due to its inhospitable conditions. The thick atmosphere consisting of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide and the intense surface temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit make it impossible for humans to survive there. Despite the many unmanned missions that have been sent to Venus, no spacecraft has been able to land and function for more than a few hours on the planet's surface for over three decades.\n\nThe distance between Earth and Venus varies, posing another obstacle to studying the planet. While humans have sent multiple spacecraft to Venus, the harsh conditions have prevented any successful landings for an extended period. The extreme atmospheric pressure and temperature on Venus make it a perilous environment for humans to explore.\n\nEfforts to overcome the challenges of Venus exploration are underway, with NASA working on potential solutions to the planet's hostile conditions. One approach involves the concept of floating above the planet's surface, akin to how jet airplanes navigate turbulent weather by flying at higher altitudes. While this method presents its own risks, it offers a potential avenue for conducting research on Venus.\n\nIn summary, the complexities of Venus, from its harsh atmosphere to the extreme temperatures, make it a daunting task for humans to study the planet up close. The barriers to exploration, including the hazardous conditions and the lack of suitable technology, underscore the formidable nature of Venus as a target for scientific inquiry.",
        "I am against the development of driverless cars because it would be a waste of money. Just imagine all the things we could do for other causes instead. People are already lazy, and with driverless cars, they wouldn't have to do anything. It's not teaching them how to drive; it's encouraging people to be underdeveloped. They won't be able to fully experience the real world because they'll be spending a lot of their time on social media, as they do now. Why is it bad to make driverless cars?\n\nFirst of all, who would benefit from driverless cars? Sure, the rich would have them, but wouldn't they pose a greater threat? How useful would they really be? So many questions arise. You know, it's new. People like new things, whether it's cars, phones, or hunting rifles. We crave new innovations, and when someone reads a newspaper headline stating, \"Google's co-founder invented driverless cars,\" people love that kind of thing. What gets them even more interested is when they are given details about the new functions and the accessibility that a driverless car provides, all without the need to drive.\n\nSecond, we could be using the funds for a more meaningful purpose, such as buying things for the uneducated or helping the homeless.",
        "Autonomous vehicles are a significant development in this technological era. However, some people express concerns about the safety of driverless cars on public roads.  I personally believe that companies should not produce these vehicles due to several potentially dangerous flaws.  Because these cars are programmed to strictly adhere to all traffic laws, paradoxically, they might cause more accidents.\n\nOne reason for this is the mixed traffic environment. Not everyone will own a driverless car, and human drivers are notorious for not always following the rules. An autonomous vehicle traveling at precisely the speed limit might not be able to react safely to a human driver behaving unpredictably, such as suddenly stopping or crossing the road illegally.\n\nAnother concern involves the potential for driver complacency.  Someone in a driverless car might fall asleep or become distracted, assuming the car will handle everything.  However, unforeseen circumstances could arise that require human intervention, and the driver might not be able to react quickly enough to take control, potentially leading to a serious accident or even fatalities.",
        "The ability of technology to read expressions could be incredibly valuable for various reasons. Many individuals struggle to guess or recognize others' feelings, which can lead to communication problems. While it may not solve every issue, it could certainly mitigate some of them.\n\nWith technology advanced enough to interpret people's emotions, it could prevent or defuse conflicts. For instance, if a computer detects that someone is feeling sad or depressed, it could alert a teacher to offer support to that student. By providing assistance, it could prevent the individual from making poor decisions, benefiting them in the long term. Additionally, it could help teachers tailor their teaching methods to be most effective for students. If the technology detects that a student is confused, it could notify the teacher, allowing them to address the issue. Often, students, or people in general, hesitate to ask for help, either due to embarrassment or a desire to be independent.",
        "In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author delves into the complexities and potential benefits of studying Venus. Despite the formidable challenges posed by Venus's harsh environment, which includes extreme temperatures, high pressure, and toxic atmospheric conditions, the author argues that the wealth of information and resources that could be gleaned from exploring Venus is substantial.\n\nThe author begins by highlighting past failed attempts to study Venus due to its inhospitable conditions. These challenges have led researchers to explore alternative methods for investigating the planet. NASA has proposed a concept where humans could remain above Venus's surface in hot air balloons or utilize rovers equipped with mechanical systems to collect samples and gather data. These approaches offer a way to circumvent direct exposure to Venus's hostile environment while still enabling scientific exploration.\n\nScientists believe that studying Venus could provide valuable insights into Earth's history and potential future scenarios. There are indications that Venus may have had conditions suitable for life in the distant past, similar geological features as Earth such as oceans, valleys, mountains, and craters. Understanding these similarities between Earth and Venus could offer crucial knowledge for planetary research and enhance our understanding of celestial bodies within our universe.\n\nUltimately, despite the risks involved in exploring such a challenging environment as Venus, the author contends that the rewards of acquiring new knowledge make it a worthwhile endeavor.",
        "The author advocates for the study of Venus as a worthwhile endeavor, despite the inherent risks, by highlighting the benefits and potential solutions drawn from Mars exploration.\n\nThe text states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" This suggests that by studying Venus, we may uncover similarities it once shared with Earth.\n\nAdditionally, the text notes, \"recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.\" This indicates that, in terms of travel speed and time, Venus is the most accessible planet.\n\nFinally, the author discusses the innovative approaches space agencies are considering to explore Mars, such as, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus, which would allow scientists to float above the fray.\"",
        "The article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" argues that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers.  However, the author fails to effectively support this claim, instead frequently providing evidence that reinforces the opposite position.\n\nThe author primarily focuses on the difficulties and risks associated with exploring Venus.  For example, they state, \"it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely\" and \"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\"  The entire third paragraph further emphasizes these challenges, noting, \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.\" This accumulation of evidence highlighting the dangers of Venus undermines the author's argument for its exploration.\n\nWhile the author claims that pursuing the study of Venus is worthwhile, they simultaneously acknowledge the obstacles to obtaining further data.  The author points out, \"More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\"  Even the proposed solution of using a blimp-like vehicle to send humans is presented alongside the caveat of \"toasty\" 170-degree Fahrenheit temperatures.  This again reinforces the difficulties of Venusian exploration, weakening the central argument.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's argument that Venus is worth exploring despite the dangers is poorly supported. The provided evidence primarily focuses on the immense challenges and risks involved, essentially supporting the counterargument that exploring Venus is impractical, if not impossible.",
        "Integrating this technology into classrooms could significantly benefit both students and educators.  The software, as described, can \"recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" allowing teachers to address learning difficulties in real-time. This immediate feedback loop offers a significant advantage over traditional methods of gauging student comprehension.  Furthermore, the software's potential extends beyond monitoring engagement.  By analyzing facial expressions, it can inform instructors about a student's emotional state, enabling them to adapt their teaching methods for optimal effectiveness.  Dr. Huang's observation that the software \"could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,\" underscores its potential to personalize learning and enhance educational outcomes.  Additionally, the technology could help identify instances of dishonesty, such as a student falsely claiming to have completed online assignments, facilitating timely intervention and resolution.\n\nBeyond the classroom, this technology holds immense promise for the medical field.  The ability to \"construct a 3-D computer model of the face [with] all 44 major muscles,\" as described in the text, offers a powerful tool for aspiring doctors to learn and understand human anatomy. This detailed visualization could revolutionize medical education, providing a more engaging and comprehensive learning experience than traditional methods. While some might argue that this knowledge can be acquired through other means, the software's interactive nature provides a distinct advantage.\n\nWhile the text notes that \"we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day\" by interpreting facial expressions, this technology offers a more nuanced and precise understanding.  We already infer emotional states from facial cues in our daily interactions with friends and family, but this software can enhance our innate abilities, providing a deeper insight into the complexities of human emotion.  This enhanced understanding can be invaluable in numerous fields, from education and medicine to social work and beyond.",
        "The article \"Driveless Cars Are Coming\" presents arguments for and against the adoption of autonomous vehicles.  While the article features expert opinions from both car companies and scientists, the evidence presented leans heavily against the feasibility and safety of driverless technology.\n\nOne major concern is the cost.  As stated in paragraph 6, the sensors and other components required for autonomous driving inflate the manufacturing cost to a staggering two hundred million dollars.  This exorbitant price tag raises questions about accessibility and practicality.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that these cars are truly \"driverless\" is challenged in paragraph 7.  The article notes that while the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, drivers are still required to keep their hands on the wheel due to touch sensors.  This requirement not only undermines the concept of a fully autonomous vehicle but also suggests that the high cost does not translate into a fully realized, hands-free driving experience.  It essentially begs the question: why pay such a premium for a feature that remains partially reliant on human intervention?\n\nThis reliance on human oversight also creates ambiguity regarding liability in the event of an accident.  If a collision occurs, determining fault becomes complex.  Is the manufacturer responsible, or does the onus fall on the driver who is expected to remain vigilant and ready to intervene?  This lack of clarity poses significant legal and ethical challenges.\n\nFinally, the article argues that despite the futuristic appeal of driverless cars, their current limitations make them impractical and potentially dangerous.  The technology is still prone to errors, while human drivers possess the advantage of reaction time and common sense.",

        "The \"Face on Mars\" is merely a natural landform and not the result of alien creation, as there is no known life on Mars. NASA used a camera with the highest possible resolution to determine if the formation was made by any entity.\n\nThe article, specifically in paragraph 10, states, \"On April 8, 2001\u2014a cloudless summer day in Cydonia\u2014Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.\" This was when they used the camera's maximum resolution to photograph the \"Face.\" The camera had the capability to capture images of airplanes on the ground or even the pyramids created by the Egyptians on Earth.\n\nFurthermore, on April 5, 1998, when the Mars Global Surveyor first flew over Cydonia, it captured ten images. These images showed no signs of alien activity; they depicted only landforms.\n\nFinally, the day of truth arrived, and it was revealed that the \"Face\" was, in fact, just a landform, resembling the landforms in the American West. The article's last paragraph mentions, \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n\nThis is the reason the \"Face on Mars\" cannot be the creation of aliens.

        "I strongly support the development of autonomous vehicles.  Human error contributes significantly to the frequency and severity of accidents on our roads. Autonomous vehicles offer the potential to nearly eliminate this human factor.  Furthermore, they promise increased efficiency.\n\nUnlike human drivers who can be prone to anger, distraction, or disorientation, autonomous vehicles utilize the logic of a computer.  A computer program is impervious to emotional outbursts or passenger distractions, offering a potentially safer alternative to a human driver.  Its logical decision-making process enhances safety on the road.  Google's seven-year track record of testing semi-autonomous vehicles under specific conditions, with no reported crashes to date, further supports this potential.\n\nBeyond safety, autonomous vehicles offer a more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transportation.  Google co-founder Sergey Brin suggests they could be twice as fuel-efficient as current taxis and buses. This increased efficiency translates to a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, contributing to a cleaner environment.  Moreover, greater fuel efficiency benefits the economy by reducing our dependence on imported oil.\n\nIn conclusion, autonomous vehicles offer a compelling future for transportation. By placing a computer at the wheel, we can enhance safety, optimize routes, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, creating a cleaner, more efficient, and safer world.",
        "The article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" describes how a NASA spacecraft orbiting Mars, while scouting landing sites for a future mission, captured an image resembling a human face. This shadowy likeness, seemingly smiling back at the camera, sparked considerable speculation.\n\nWhile some theorized the face could be evidence of alien activity\u2014a landing site, a takeoff point, or even a deliberate construction\u2014the article explains it is most likely a rock formation.  The grainy 1976 image, taken by the Viking 1 orbiter, fueled the imagination of many. Some skeptics even suggested that Martian clouds, through which the spacecraft\u2019s cameras peered, were intentionally obscuring alien structures.  However, the \"face\" is located in Mars' northern latitudes, where it was winter at the time of the photograph.  The apparent haze was more likely atmospheric conditions, perhaps wind-blown snow.\n\nThe idea of aliens deliberately creating such a recognizable feature, knowing it would eventually be discovered, seems far-fetched.  A subsequent, higher-resolution image taken by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) in 2001 provided a much clearer view of the formation. This more detailed picture revealed the \"face\" to be nothing more than a mesa-like rock formation, dispelling the earlier theories.  While the 1976 image generated considerable excitement and speculation, the 2001 photograph reassured the public that there was no mystery to fear or be surprised by.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nIn the article, the author supports their thesis by first explaining how Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin. Venus is indeed the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. While our orbital paths mean that sometimes we're closer to Mars and other times to Venus, the similarities between Earth and Venus are striking. However, the author notes that Venus's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's.\n\nThe author emphasizes that Venus maintains the highest temperatures of any planet in our solar system. The planet's hostile environment presents additional challenges, including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.\n\nTo illustrate potential exploration methods, the author describes a theoretical blimp-like vehicle hovering approximately 30 miles above the turbulent Venusian landscape. This approach mirrors how commercial jets fly at higher altitudes to avoid storms, allowing researchers to observe patterns and phenomena from a safer vantage point.\n\nHowever, the author acknowledges a significant limitation: such high-altitude vehicles cannot collect physical samples of rocks and gases. For scientists to conduct comprehensive studies of Venus, they would need to get closer to the surface.",

Here's why this geological formation captured imaginations but ultimately proved to be nothing extraordinary.\n\nInitially, the formation's face-like appearance\u2014with what seemed to be eyes, nose, and mouth\u2014captivated public interest. However, on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor provided definitive evidence that dispelled alien theories. The new images, ten times clearer than previous ones, revealed the true nature of the formation.\n\nWhile skeptics suggested that alien markings might be obscured by haze, subsequent imaging proved otherwise.

In 2001, even higher-resolution images were captured, showing that what some interpreted as Egyptian-style pyramids or structures was actually a Martian butte or mesa\u2014geological features similar to those found in the American West, particularly resembling formations in Idaho's Snake River Plain.\n\nThe evidence is in the details:\n- The 1998 images provided resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel, compared to the 1976 Viking photo's 43 meters per pixel\n- Higher resolution revealed natural geological patterns consistent with terrestrial formations\n- No artificial structures or alien monuments were found upon detailed examination",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the essay arguing against driverless cars:\n\n# The Case Against Driverless Cars\n\nThe development of autonomous vehicles, while technologically impressive, presents significant concerns that warrant careful consideration. This essay examines why driverless cars should not be pursued, focusing on two critical issues: safety concerns and legal complications.\n\n## Safety Concerns\n\nThe safety implications of autonomous vehicles pose serious risks to both passengers and the public. General Motors' tests, conducted only on specialized tracks, fail to demonstrate these vehicles' capability to navigate real-world conditions. As the author notes, \"General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track,\" but this controlled environment hardly reflects the unpredictable nature of everyday traffic.\n\nMoreover, the requirement for human oversight presents its own dangers. While these vehicles \"alert you when human assistance is needed,\" the prolonged periods of inactivity could lead to driver complacency or drowsiness. The mandate that \"the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over\" creates a paradoxical situation where drivers must stay vigilant while being essentially passive.\n\n## Legal Complexities\n\nThe introduction of autonomous vehicles would necessitate a complete overhaul of existing traffic laws and liability frameworks. A crucial question remains unresolved: \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault\u2014the driver or the manufacturer?\" This uncertainty extends beyond individual incidents, as \"new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident,\" creating a complex legal landscape that could take years to navigate.",
        "Do you recall the day you received your driver's license? I certainly do. Nowadays, there's a strong push towards developing self-driving cars. While the concept of driverless cars sounds intriguing, we must consider the potential benefits and drawbacks they may bring.\n\nObtaining my driver's license was a significant milestone in my life. It symbolized the freedom to drive and make my own choices. The idea of self-driving cars, however, raises concerns for me. Who would be liable in the event of a crash involving a driverless car? It shouldn't be the driver's fault, but would the manufacturers take responsibility for any malfunctions?\n\nHistorically, driving has not been a major issue, aside from the occasional accident or tragedy. The main problem has been drivers operating under the influence. If self-driving cars become the norm, the risk of intoxicated driving may increase. In the event of a crash, who would be at fault, the autonomous car or the impaired driver?\n\nThe cost of cars has significantly risen in recent years, largely due to the incorporation of advanced technologies. Introducing self-driving cars would likely further escalate the prices, making them unaffordable for many. Additionally, the introduction of driverless cars could lead to the displacement of jobs, such as taxi drivers and truckers, who rely on driving for income.\n\nIn my view, the implementation of self-driving cars may create more problems than solutions. The automotive industry has already complicated the driving experience, so the necessity of cars that drive themselves is questionable. The saying, \"if it isn't broke, don't fix it,\" applies here. I believe self-driving cars are not a necessity in the present or the future, and the potential risks they pose outweigh the benefits.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n**The Face on Mars: Natural Formation, Not Alien Creation**\n\nWhile some people believe the Face on Mars was created by extraterrestrial beings, scientific evidence demonstrates it is simply a natural Martian landform, similar to geological formations found on Earth. This explanation, while less exciting than alien architecture, is supported by extensive research and high-resolution imagery.\n\nAs NASA scientists have documented, the initial photographs of the Face did appear to resemble a human visage or, as some suggested, an Egyptian pharaoh. However, subsequent high-quality images revealed that these facial features were merely an illusion created by shadows on the Martian landscape. The formation is actually comparable to the buttes and mesas commonly found in the American West.\n\nAddressing conspiracy theories about NASA concealing evidence of Martian life, it's important to note that such a discovery would actually benefit the space agency. As even NASA budget advocates have acknowledged, confirming ancient civilizations on Mars would be advantageous to the organization. There would be no logical reason to suppress such a monumental finding.\n\nThe definitive evidence came from two key observations. First, on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor captured images of Cydonia that were ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. These clearly showed a natural geological formation rather than an artificial structure. When some skeptics suggested that Martian haze might have obscured alien markings, a second set of images taken on April 8, 2001\u2014on a clear Martian day\u2014confirmed the initial findings. These high-resolution photographs were detailed enough to reveal even small constructed objects had they existed.\n\nIn conclusion, the Face on Mars exemplifies how natural geological processes can create intriguing formations that may initially appear artificial. Like Earth's buttes and mesas, it is the product of natural forces rather than alien architecture. The high-quality imagery now available leaves no room for alternative interpretations: the Face on Mars, while fascinating, is simply another example of Mars's natural geological features.",
        "The integration of technology capable of reading students' emotional expressions in classrooms holds significant potential. This technology could greatly enhance educational experiences by tailoring content to individual student interests. For instance, it could provide articles and resources based on what captivates students, thereby fostering engagement. If students are more interested in a topic, they are likely to read more, which could improve their lexile levels and reading comprehension. Additionally, it could support art students by offering insights into creating more lifelike paintings, particularly in capturing accurate facial expressions, which is a common challenge for artists of all skill levels.\n\nIf such technology were present in classrooms today, it could suggest articles and websites that align with students' interests. For example, if a teacher assigns students to choose a story to read online, the technology could provide a list of suggested stories. By analyzing students' facial expressions, it could identify which articles would be most appealing, thereby enhancing the students' reading experience and comprehension.\n\nHowever, there are potential downsides, such as the risk of distraction. Students, during their free time, might engage in non-educational activities, such as playing games or watching videos, which the technology could, in turn, prioritize, leading to more distractions. Consequently, students could find it more challenging to focus, resulting in decreased productivity.",
        "Imagine a classroom where technology can understand students' emotions. This technology offers several valuable benefits.  First, it can identify a range of emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This awareness can foster empathy among students, helping them understand and respond kindly to their classmates' feelings.  It can also promote self-awareness, allowing students to recognize and manage their own emotions more effectively.\n\nSecond, this technology can detect confusion and boredom.  This allows teachers to identify students who need extra help and adjust their teaching to keep students engaged and motivated.  By recognizing these subtle cues, teachers can gain valuable insights into their students' learning experiences and identify potential challenges they might be facing both inside and outside the classroom.\n\nFinally, by understanding students' emotional states, teachers can significantly improve communication and build stronger relationships. They can offer appropriate support, whether it's providing space and time for a struggling student or engaging in a conversation to help process difficult emotions. This understanding can also empower teachers to incorporate lessons on emotional regulation and resilience, creating a more positive and supportive learning environment.  Ultimately, this technology has the potential to benefit both teachers and students, fostering a more empathetic, responsive, and effective classroom.",
        "The potential of technology to read the emotional expressions of students is immense. This ability could significantly impact how and what students learn. For example, if a student is struggling with a problem, the computer could detect this and adjust the difficulty level. While technology may not benefit all students equally, some students may excel in hands-on learning, visual aids, or auditory instructions, all of which a teacher can provide. However, meeting the individual needs of multiple students without consuming excessive time is a challenge. This new technology, on the other hand, could swiftly identify a student's frustration or difficulty, even when the student remains silent, thus eliminating the ability to conceal emotions through facial recognition.\n\nBeyond enhancing the learning process, the Facial Action Coding System could prove beneficial in addressing mental health issues. For instance, if a student displays a high degree of sadness or anger, educators could promptly identify the underlying concerns, allowing for the provision of appropriate support.\n\nFacial recognition technology has the potential to address a myriad of issues, far beyond what one could initially imagine.",
        "Driverless cars are on the horizon, but they raise concerns about safety for drivers and their families. While these cars could be beneficial if properly developed by knowledgeable technicians, there are uncertainties surrounding their effectiveness.\n\nMy stance on driverless cars is neutral. Humans are capable of driving vehicles proficiently, although fatigue from long drives can be an issue. Additionally, these \"driverless\" cars still require human intervention in complex traffic situations or construction zones. The potential risks arise when the person at the wheel falls asleep and the car needs manual control to avoid accidents.\n\nThe idea of tech giant Google producing driverless cars is controversial. Traditional automakers like Toyota, Ford, Chevy, or Pontiac seem more fitting for such ventures than a company primarily known for internet services. Google's pursuit of additional profits through this project raises ethical concerns as blame may shift to the occupant in case of accidents.\n\nWhile creating driverless vehicles isn't inherently flawed, technical challenges loom large and could deter consumers from embracing them fully due to safety uncertainties. In scenarios where an accident occurs and results in catastrophic outcomes like explosions, attributing fault becomes murky when a human occupant was present but not actively driving.\n\nDesignating specific tracks exclusively for driverless car use could mitigate potential hazards posed by technical glitches leading to dangerous incidents within urban settings. Perhaps Google should stick to its core competency in internet services rather than venturing into manufacturing automobiles given the complexities involved that could expose them to liability risks stemming from malfunctions post-sale.\n\nIn conclusion, caution is warranted as integrating advanced technology like autonomous vehicles demands meticulous planning and robust safety measures to ensure public trust and minimize legal implications if unforeseen issues arise once these vehicles hit the market.",
        "Using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Sometimes students won't ask for help because they don't want people to think they are dumb. There are often too many students for a teacher to notice when a student does not understand something or is bored. Therefore, having this technology in classrooms would be beneficial for both teachers and students.\n\nStudents often hesitate to ask for help, but with this technology, teachers will be able to identify when a student is struggling to grasp a lesson. The article mentions, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" which could be invaluable for teachers to intervene and assist students in need. Since a significant portion of human communication is nonverbal, especially in terms of emotional cues, this technology could greatly enhance teachers' ability to support students. Many students do not verbalize when they are struggling, and this technology could prevent them from silently struggling.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the passage \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\":\n\nVenus, often called Earth's twin, presents both fascinating opportunities and significant challenges for scientific exploration. The planet's remarkable similarities to Earth\u2014including its comparable size, density, and relative proximity\u2014make it an compelling target for study. However, these similarities mask extreme conditions that make exploration extraordinarily difficult.\n\nThe harsh realities of Venus become apparent when examining previous exploration attempts. As noted in the text, unmanned spacecraft missions to Venus's surface have been short-lived, with no spacecraft surviving longer than a few hours after landing. The hostile environment responsible for these failures is characterized by several extreme conditions:\n\n- An atmosphere composed of 97% carbon dioxide\n- Clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid\n- Surface temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit\n- Atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's\n\nDespite these challenges, NASA continues to develop innovative solutions for studying Venus safely and productively. One promising approach involves using blimp-like vehicles to float above the severe surface conditions. This strategy would allow scientists to conduct research from a safer vantage point, where both temperature and pressure are more manageable.\n\nNASA is also advancing technological solutions to overcome Venus's harsh environment. Modern computers, which are more powerful and flexible than their predecessors, combined with mechanical parts designed to withstand extreme pressure and heat, offer new possibilities for extended exploration missions.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text about driverless cars:\n\nDriverless cars represent a promising innovation, particularly for those who might otherwise be tempted to use their phones while driving or drive under the influence of alcohol, putting their lives and others at risk. These autonomous vehicles could potentially reduce fatalities caused by drunk driving and distracted driving. They could also help prevent accidents caused by drowsy drivers, allowing them to reach their destinations safely while the vehicle handles the operation.\n\nHowever, human drivers must remain alert even in autonomous vehicles, as certain situations still require human intervention. These include navigating through construction zones, accident scenes, and other complex scenarios that demand human judgment. \n\nThere are also potential drawbacks to consider. For instance, if a mechanical malfunction occurs that requires specialized expertise or equipment to repair, vehicle owners might face extended periods without transportation. Additionally, even in autonomous mode, human supervision remains necessary, as drivers must monitor for pedestrians, animals, and unexpected obstacles in the road.\n\nWhile driverless cars offer both advantages and disadvantages, their widespread adoption may depend on further technological advancement to address current limitations. Only when these challenges are resolved can we fully evaluate their place in our transportation future.",

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Face on Mars: A Natural Formation\n\nThere's an ongoing debate about the mysterious \"Face\" spotted on Mars. While some believe it's an alien artifact, I'm convinced it's simply a natural rock formation. Let me explain why.\n\nFirst, consider how our eyes can play tricks on us, making us see patterns that don't actually exist\u2014a phenomenon known as pareidolia. What we're observing is merely a collection of rocks casting shadows in a particular way. While traces of water have been found on Mars, suggesting the possibility of ancient life, the \"Face\" remains our only supposed evidence of intelligent construction. If artificial structures existed on Mars, wouldn't we expect to find more examples?\n\nOver the past 25 years, this image has circulated widely in media outlets. However, subsequent high-resolution photographs of the same location have confirmed it's just a natural landform. NASA, staffed with some of the world's most brilliant scientists, has consistently maintained this position.\n\nConsider these key points:\n\n- No additional evidence supports the artificial structure theory\n- Higher quality images reveal a typical Martian geological formation\n- NASA's repeated studies confirm its natural origins\n- The phenomenon resembles other cases of pattern recognition, like seeing shapes in clouds\n\nThis situation mirrors other unsubstantiated claims, such as Bigfoot sightings, where people mistake natural formations for something more extraordinary. While it's intriguing that the formation resembles a face, this coincidence doesn't prove intelligent design.\n\nUntil concrete evidence emerges\u2014beyond ambiguous photographs\u2014the logical conclusion is that we're looking at a natural geological feature. I challenge believers to provide substantial proof supporting the artificial structure theory.\n\nThe truth often lies in the simplest explanation: what we're seeing is a fascinating but natural Martian landform, shaped by eons of geological processes.\n\nI rest my case.",

Additionally, I will provide evidence to support my claims, allowing you to draw the same conclusion.\n\nThis technology, which reads students' emotional expressions, offers several benefits. It can inform teachers about how students feel regarding their assignments, alert them to any personal issues students might be facing, and, ultimately, reduce the dropout rate.\n\nFirstly, the system can help teachers understand how students feel about their work. For instance, students may struggle with assignments but hesitate to speak up. By analyzing students' expressions, the technology can reveal when students are confused, enabling teachers to offer timely assistance. This insight, gained through the computer, can be invaluable for identifying students' academic challenges.\n\nSecondly, the system can alert teachers to students experiencing personal difficulties, as indicated by their facial expressions.

        "Do you believe that driverless cars are a beneficial innovation? Yes or No? Driverless cars come with both advantages and disadvantages, as they have the potential to revolutionize transportation but may also encounter setbacks.\n\nDriverless cars are not an ideal concept.\n\nThe primary reason is that these vehicles are not entirely autonomous. In situations such as navigating through construction zones or encountering accidents, the car requires human intervention. It lacks full capacity to handle complex driving scenarios independently and alerts the driver when manual control is necessary. This raises a crucial question: if these cars are marketed as \"driverless,\" why do they necessitate human intervention in certain circumstances? Shouldn't their advanced technology be adequate for all driving scenarios without relying on the driver's input? To achieve true intelligence in driverless cars, a myriad of sensors is essential.\n\nMy stance on driverless cars is firm\u2014I view them unfavorably. They demonstrate limitations in handling diverse situations effectively. Moreover, what would happen if an intoxicated or incapacitated individual was behind the wheel and encountered an emergency situation? Since the vehicle cannot function autonomously and the driver is unable to respond appropriately due to impairment, I foresee unfavorable outcomes.\n\nFundamentally, drivers must remain vigilant at all times and be prepared to assume control should any unforeseen incidents occur or technological malfunctions take place within the vehicle.\n\nIn case of an accident or technical failure within the car - who would be held accountable - should blame fall upon the driver or be attributed to the manufacturer?",
        "A computer capable of recognizing human emotions presents both advantages and disadvantages. While helpful in certain contexts, such technology could also compromise privacy. For example, someone experiencing sadness or depression might not wish to disclose their feelings, yet a computer could detect and potentially share this information without consent. This could lead to unintended consequences, especially within families, by revealing sensitive information.\n\nFurthermore, some individuals prefer to keep their emotions private.  While they might feign happiness or interest, a computer could discern their true feelings and reveal their disinterest or unhappiness to others, potentially damaging relationships. As the article notes, \"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\" observes Dr. Huang, \"even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression\" (Paragraph 4). This indicates that even subtle emotional cues can be detected, regardless of how overtly they are displayed.  For example, a person might smile less broadly than they intend, yet their true feelings could still be revealed by such technology.\n\nIn my opinion, developing computers that analyze human emotions is a detrimental idea.  People should have the right to privacy and emotional autonomy.  Allowing computers to interpret and potentially broadcast our feelings is intrusive and could have negative social consequences. It's crucial to maintain the current status quo, where individuals can express themselves authentically without fear of their true feelings being misinterpreted or causing harm to others.",
        "I am against the development of driverless cars for several reasons, primarily concerning safety, job displacement, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nMy foremost concern is safety. While proponents tout the potential for reducing human error, driverless cars are still vulnerable to unforeseen circumstances.  They cannot react to every situation with the same nuanced judgment as a human driver.  Consider scenarios like sudden black ice, unexpected road debris, or navigating complex construction zones.  A sleeping passenger (a likely occurrence when one is not actively driving) would be unable to take control quickly in such situations, potentially leading to accidents, injuries, or even fatalities.  Furthermore, the legal implications of accidents involving driverless cars are still unclear, raising the possibility of drivers being held liable for malfunctions despite not being in control.\n\nThe economic impact of widespread driverless car adoption is also troubling.  Numerous jobs directly related to driving would be lost, impacting professions like taxi drivers, truckers, delivery drivers, valet parkers, and those working in parking-related industries.  This displacement could have significant economic consequences for many families.  Furthermore, the ripple effect on the broader automotive industry, including dealerships and repair shops, could be substantial.",

While the vehicle itself may be technologically advanced, external factors such as weather conditions or the car's inability to fully control itself could contribute to accidents.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\" captured public imagination in 1976 when NASA's Viking 1 orbiter captured images of a mesa in the Cydonia region that resembled a human face. This sparked widespread speculation, fueled by magazines, social media, and even discussions in everyday settings.  As author [Name needed here - replace (5) with author and publication details]  notes, \"The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows...\"  Some enthusiastically urged NASA to investigate these formations further, highlighting the importance of such discoveries to taxpayers.\n\nResponding to public interest, NASA revisited Cydonia.  \"We felt this was important to taxpayers,\" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" [Citation needed - replace (6) with source].  A second mission in 1998, using the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), attempted to capture clearer images.  However, initial attempts were unsuccessful due to cloud cover and incorrect positioning.  When MGS finally located the mesa, the image appeared less distinct than the original Viking photograph.  Skeptics suggested that the earlier \"face\" was merely a trick of light and shadow, while some speculated that, as one source [Citation needed - replace (8) with source] put it, \"Alien markings were hidden by haze.\"  Further observations in 2001 showed the feature even more eroded by natural processes.\n\nThe initial excitement surrounding the \"Face on Mars\" eventually waned as subsequent images revealed it to be a natural landform.",
        "Myths, fables, tall tales\u2014what do they mean to you? People often gravitate towards stories that may not be entirely true. Some believe that NASA is concealing information about a supposed Face created by aliens on Mars, but NASA denies such claims. The Face found on Mars could simply be a result of natural phenomena like seasonal changes, similar in size to other landforms, with no concrete evidence of extraterrestrial life. Despite this, some argue that the absence of definitive evidence leaves room for speculation as the Face does bear resemblance to an actual face.\n\nIn his work \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author suggests that seasonal variations may have influenced perceptions of the Martian landform in question. According to the text, during April 1998 winter was at its peak on Mars\u2014a time characterized by cloudy conditions. The author posits that these environmental factors may have contributed to the perception of a face-like structure. Subsequent investigations with advanced technology revealed that the Face was akin in size to typical Earthly land formations.\n\nUltimately, analysis indicates that the Face closely resembles common Earthly features like buttes and mesas found in regions such as America's West. The author notes similarities between these structures and iconic landmarks like Mt. Rushmore\u2014a comparison meant to underscore how natural formations can mimic recognizable shapes without being intentional representations. Reflecting on this perspective raises doubts about whether any living creature could naturally resemble such features.\n\nDespite ongoing debates regarding its origins and nature, there remains no definitive proof supporting claims of extraterrestrial life represented by the Martian landform known as \"the Face.\" Advanced imaging techniques have provided clearer views of this feature over time yet failed to reveal any signs indicative of life forms or artificial constructs.\n\nWhile some proponents argue for potential extraterrestrial origins for the Face based on inconclusive evidence, prevailing viewpoints suggest it is more likely just a natural geological formation resembling facial features due to shifting environmental conditions and imaging perspectives over time.\n\nIn conclusion, uncertainties surrounding alleged anomalies like the Martian Face underscore our evolving understanding shaped by technological advancements and scientific inquiry. As we continue exploring our universe with newfound tools and perspectives, it remains imperative for future generations to drive discovery forward and uncover what truly lies within our solar system\u2014an endeavor waiting for new minds eager to leave their mark on history.",

The pictures taken from Mars initially suggested a face-like structure, but with newer technology, we now see that it is simply a mesa or butte. Despite NASA providing real photos of the area on Mars, there are still disagreements about its true nature.\n\nIn 1976, NASA sent out the Viking 1 mission which captured an image that sparked public interest in what became known as \"the Face on Mars.\" While many scientists were skeptical about it being an actual face, this image became a cultural icon featured in various media for years. However, doubts persisted among NASA scientists regarding its true identity.\n\nIn 1998, to address public curiosity and skepticism about the \"Face on Mars,\" NASA conducted another imaging mission using the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS). The resulting high-resolution images confirmed that the structure was indeed a natural landform rather than a face. Despite this conclusive evidence presented to the public online in 1998 and later in 2001 under clearer conditions, some continued to question NASA's findings.\n\nCritics accused NASA of withholding information or hiding potential evidence of extraterrestrial life by claiming the landform was not artificial. However, such accusations overlook the fact that any discovery supporting alien existence would greatly benefit and elevate NASA's reputation globally. Additionally, advanced imaging technologies used by MGS provided much clearer pictures compared to earlier missions like Viking.\n\nUltimately, despite personal beliefs or suspicions regarding the nature of \"the Face on Mars,\" factual evidence and detailed photographs suggest otherwise \u2013 it is indeed a natural landform rather than an artificially created face. Through multiple missions aimed at capturing detailed images for public scrutiny and understanding of Cydonia's features like this one alleged face formation; these efforts reflect NASA's commitment to transparency and scientific inquiry above all else.",

A more nuanced understanding of emotional expression, facilitated by FACS, could lead to more realistic and sophisticated CGI, enriching the portrayal of human emotion in movies and video games.  This advancement promises a new era of realism and graphical fidelity.\n\nWhile the benefits of FACS are numerous, potential concerns, such as granting computers excessive control, must be addressed. However, simple safeguards, like a disable feature, can mitigate these risks, preventing potential misuse and ensuring responsible implementation.\n\nIn conclusion, FACS represents a remarkable advancement in computing, entertainment, and beyond. Its ability to personalize interactions based on individual emotional responses promises transformative changes, from customized virtual lessons mirroring the attentiveness of a human tutor to enhanced emotional depth in movies and video games.",
        "Adventures at the Sea\n\nYou should consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program for several reasons. Firstly, you will have the opportunity to learn about various animals, including their dietary needs and habits. As mentioned in paragraph six, the animals had to be fed and watered multiple times a day, with hay and oats being brought up from the lower holds and stalls regularly cleaned.\n\nAnother compelling aspect of the program is the chance to embark on a significant journey. You will get to experience life at sea and explore the world, potentially sparking a passion for a maritime career. In paragraph nine, a participant expresses gratitude for the eye-opening experience, noting the increased awareness of the needs of people from different countries.\n\nLastly, the program offers the invaluable opportunity to immerse yourself in the cultures of other countries. Wouldn't you love the chance to travel the world and witness the beauty of diverse places? This is exemplified in the experiences shared in paragraph five, where the joy of helping others is coupled with the awe of the sights in Europe and the unique charm of the streets of the water-bound city of Venice, Italy.\n\nIn conclusion, the Seagoing Cowboys program is the perfect avenue to broaden your horizons, experience the wonders the world has to offer, and make a meaningful impact.",
        "Imagine a computer that can detect your emotions \u2013 whether you're happy, sad, or confused. This isn't science fiction; it's the potential of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology. While the idea of emotion-reading technology might seem intriguing on a personal level, its value truly shines in the classroom.\n\nDeveloped with the help of Professors Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe, FACS can benefit not only students but also teachers and administrators. As mentioned in paragraph six of the original text, a classroom computer equipped with FACS could recognize student boredom or confusion.  Imagine you're having a bad day and face a daunting five-page essay.  While you might try to hide your frustration, this technology could subtly inform your teacher of your emotional state, allowing them to adjust accordingly, perhaps postponing the assignment to a better time.\n\nThis technology offers a significant advantage in understanding student engagement. Teachers could gain insight into how students genuinely feel about an activity or project.  What the teacher perceives as engaging might actually bore the students, leading to decreased effort and suboptimal learning.\n\nBeyond the classroom, this technology has applications in online advertising.  Paragraph six also mentions how online ads can adapt to your reactions. If you smile at a web ad, a similar one might appear next.  Frown, and the advertisement changes. This principle, applied to classroom computers and iPads, could personalize the learning experience and filter out distracting or irrelevant content.  While pop-up ads are often dismissed as annoying, the ability to tailor them to individual emotional responses could transform them into a more useful tool.\n\n\nThis technology holds promise for improving the learning environment and personalizing digital experiences.  It allows for a deeper understanding of individual emotional responses, paving the way for more responsive and effective educational strategies.",
        "Smart Cars: A Positive Step Towards Driverless Technology\n\nThe development of Smart Cars raises the question of their impact on the future of driverless vehicles.  While concerns exist regarding liability in the event of technological failures \u2013 is the driver or manufacturer responsible? \u2013 the benefits of Smart Car technology suggest a positive contribution to the evolution of autonomous driving.  These vehicles, equipped with advanced sensors, limited autonomous capabilities, and driver-alert systems, offer significant safety and convenience advantages.\n\nOne key advantage of Smart Cars lies in their sophisticated sensor systems. These sensors constantly monitor the vehicle's surroundings, contributing to features like anti-lock brakes, skid control, and rollover prevention. As noted in a recent article, \"auto makers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers.\"  These sensors are strategically placed throughout the vehicle \u2013 on wheels, the roof, and using radar \u2013 to provide a comprehensive view of the environment.\n\nFurthermore, Smart Cars possess the ability to handle certain driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. While not fully autonomous, this feature allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake within specific parameters.  As an article explains, \"They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\"  This limited autonomy eases the burden on the driver while still requiring human oversight.  Importantly, safety mechanisms, like touch sensors on the steering wheel, ensure driver engagement and prevent complete disengagement from the driving process. The driver remains essential for maneuvers like parking and intervention in complex situations. \"But special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far [are] completely driverless.\"",
        "In the future, where no one needs to buy cars because there will be a fleet of driverless vehicles, safety is a concern. The article mentions that driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, emphasizing that alert drivers are crucial for safety. However, in the case of a driverless car, the alert driver is removed from the equation, raising safety issues in the eyes of lawmakers.\n\nIn states such as California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia, testing computer-driven cars is illegal. The article predicts that more states will eventually follow, as manufacturers believe the cars will prove to be safer. Nevertheless, the current level of safety is not adequate, despite ongoing developments in driverless technology, as there are still significant flaws that need to be addressed for the cars to be deemed safe for the roads.\n\nAn advancement in driverless cars is the \"Traffic Jam Assistance\" feature, which allows the cars to steer, accelerate, and brake, though the driver is notified to take the wheel in situations that require human intervention, such as navigating through construction zones and avoiding accidents.",
        "**The Face**\n\nIn 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photograph of a formation on Mars' surface, believed by some to resemble a \"face.\" Over the years, debates have ensued about whether \"the face\" was created by aliens or is merely a natural landform. Here's why I believe it is a natural landform.\n\nIn the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" paragraph 12 explains that the image actually shows a formation on Mars comparable to a butte or mesa, landforms common in the American West. Some argue that a picture alone is insufficient to accurately determine the nature of a formation, as it represents only a portion of the scene. However, in paragraph 11, Garvin states, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image that are three times larger than the pixel size.\" Thus, if the image contained objects like airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, they would be identifiable.\n\nSome might claim the image taken by the Viking 1 spacecraft, given the 20th-century technology, is unreliable. However, paragraph 10 describes how the spacecraft was rolled 25 degrees to center the \"face\" in the field of view, allowing the team, led by Malin, to capture a remarkable photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. In the 2001 image, each pixel spans 1.56 meters, a significant improvement from the 43 meters in the 1976 Viking photo, demonstrating the decision was based, not on 20th-century technology, but on the advancements of the 21st century.",
        "Throughout history, people have always wondered whether there was ever life on Mars. One photo in particular, capturing a mysterious figure, has sparked intense speculation, bringing us closer than ever to uncovering the potential existence of life on another planet. The topic of \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" is a widely discussed subject, with some suggesting it was created by aliens, while others argue it is a natural landform.\n\nIn 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting Mars in search of a landing site for its sister ship, Viking 2. During its exploration, Viking 1 stumbled upon an image that seemed to suggest signs of life on Mars, appearing to depict a face, which sparked debates that lasted for years. However, in 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) captured a clearer image, revealing that the \"Face\" was, in fact, a natural landform.\n\nThe 1998 image, ten times sharper than the 1976 photo, was released on the JPL website, confirming that the feature was a result of natural geological processes, dispelling the notion of alien involvement. Some, however, argued that the aliens, if they existed, were obscured, as the camera, tasked with capturing the image, had to pierce through the clouds, leading to the mysterious appearance.",
        "In 1976, NASA photographs of Mars revealed a feature that resembled a human face.  The public, upon seeing these images, immediately concluded it was an alien artifact.  However, it is simply a natural landform that, from a certain angle, creates this illusion.\n\nTo address public speculation, NASA revisited the site on April 5, 1998, capturing images that clearly showed a natural landform.  However, because these photos were taken on a cloudy winter day, some remained unconvinced.  Therefore, NASA photographed the area again on April 8, 2001, this time on a clear summer day.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nLife at sea presents considerable risks, especially for a recent high school graduate. With potentially 70 years ahead to explore, discover, and build a life, the decision to venture onto a ship requires careful consideration.\n\nLiving conditions aboard pose significant challenges. Sleep quality, for instance, would likely suffer due to the constant motion of waves, the rhythmic creaking of the vessel, and the perpetual sound of water against the hull. The physical discomfort extends beyond rest\u2014seasickness could plague passengers throughout the journey. Consider that crossing the Pacific Ocean from the eastern United States takes two weeks, while reaching China requires a month at sea. That's an extended period to endure potential nausea and discomfort.\n\nThe logistics of sustaining life aboard present another challenge. Food storage for a month-long journey severely limits meal variety, likely resulting in repetitive, monotonous dining options. Weather conditions add another layer of complexity. Rainy days and storms are inevitable during such lengthy voyages. Entertainment options remain limited without internet access, primarily restricted to card games and basic activities. Moreover, wet conditions create hazardous situations, requiring extra caution when moving about the vessel.\n\nNight watch duty, as described in Luke's experience, raises concerns about sleep deprivation. Maintaining alertness during overnight shifts while managing daytime responsibilities seems particularly demanding.\n\nHowever, the journey wasn't without its merits. The article describes various recreational activities that helped pass the time: volleyball games, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other diversions that fostered camaraderie among the crew.\n\nDespite these activities, the prospect of becoming a Seagoing Cowboy doesn't appeal to me personally. The extended separation from friends and family would prove too challenging. While I appreciate my current life and educational opportunities, I understand Luke's perspective\u2014he viewed it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity he couldn't decline.",
        "I am strongly against driverless cars because I believe they will only cause trouble and make our world a worse place. I prefer to have full control of the car I am driving, rather than relying on a robot car. Additionally, the expenses associated with driverless cars would increase, requiring people to work harder to afford them.\n\nOne of the main concerns with driverless cars is their safety. These cars have not been proven to be reliably safe, and there is a risk of accidents or malfunctions that could put passengers, especially children, in danger. With the possibility of electrical difficulties or technical failures, it raises questions about the ability of inexperienced drivers to handle such situations.\n\nExperiments on advanced cars like driverless cars are unnecessary, especially when we already have perfectly functional cars available. The resources and money being invested in developing driverless cars could be better utilized elsewhere. The potential increase in taxes and prices of goods, if driverless cars become mainstream, could further burden the public and discourage people from buying cars altogether.\n\nIn conclusion, the introduction of driverless cars brings about environmental concerns, unnecessary complications, and financial burdens. I believe it is a wasteful and risky endeavor, and the focus should be on improving the cars we already have, rather than investing in a technology that may have uncertain benefits and consequences.",
        "Twenty-five years ago, NASA discovered a face on Cydonia, Mars. The face was extraordinary, resembling an Egyptian face. Many people speculated that it was a human face created by aliens, but as a scientist at NASA, I can confirm that it is not. NASA conducted a thorough investigation of the \"Face,\" aiming to debunk the theory of extraterrestrial involvement.\n\nUpon closer examination, it was revealed that the face was just another Martian mesa, a common occurrence in Cydonia. Despite the face gaining popularity in various media, including movies, magazines, radio shows, and books, NASA was determined to provide conclusive evidence. In 2001, NASA captured a closer, clearer image of the face, dispelling the illusion that it had eyes, a mouth, and a nose, thus debunking the belief that it was a face, rather than a natural landform.",

Here are several compelling reasons to consider joining: a love for animals, a desire to explore, the opportunity to earn money, and the chance to experience something new.\n\nFor animal lovers, this program is ideal. We care for livestock, specifically cattle and horses. Our responsibilities include feeding, brushing, cleaning stalls, and even leading the animals off the ship.  We typically care for around 335 horses, plus manage their hay and oat supply.\n\nThis program also offers incredible travel opportunities.  We've visited numerous countries, including those in Europe and even China. I've personally seen the Acropolis in Greece, enjoyed a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, explored an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal en route to China.\n\nFurthermore, the program provides compensation. While I'm unsure of the specific payment structure, whether by trip or hourly rate,  it's a chance to earn money while traveling.\n\nFor those who enjoy travel, the long distances we cover are a significant perk.",
        "Personally, I believe that \"driverless\" cars are extremely dangerous. They cannot react as quickly to sudden events as a human driver can. Moreover, they are not entirely \"driverless\" as there must be a person in the car at all times to take control in case of any emergencies. There is a risk of the technology that operates the car malfunctioning or crashing while passengers are onboard. Therefore, I do not support the idea of driverless cars as they create a hazardous environment, and passengers may become too engrossed in their phones or devices.\n\nOne of the primary reasons I do not endorse driverless cars is the safety concern they pose for passengers. If a company such as Google were to oversee the technology in a car, it may not be able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, such as accidents or changing weather conditions, affecting its performance.\n\nFurthermore, passengers may get distracted by their phones or devices, potentially leading to accidents.",
        "I can't imagine a future where everyone is driving driverless cars. Can you? While I think it's acceptable for people who need assistance to use them or perhaps own one, I don't see how it benefits everyone. The world is evolving in numerous ways, especially in transportation. We have bike lanes everywhere, people are walking, jogging, and there's Uber, which is now quite prominent. But why a driverless car? Are we encouraging people to become so lazy that they barely have to drive? \n\nFrom a young age, people look forward to the independence that comes with driving. It's a milestone, a rite of passage, and something that many, including myself, believe shouldn't be taken away. When you reach the age for a permit, or when you finally get your license, it feels like a significant achievement. You envision driving to a restaurant, a store, or anywhere, and that, in itself, feels rewarding, a mark of independence.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) offers potential benefits for educators and students, but its imperfections raise concerns about its practical application in schools.  While FACS could personalize online learning experiences, its limitations may ultimately outweigh its advantages.\n\nIn theory, FACS could enhance online education by analyzing students' facial expressions to gauge their understanding, engagement, and emotional state.  If a student appears confused, the system could adapt the lesson to provide additional support.  Similarly, if boredom is detected, the course could adjust to recapture the student's attention.  This personalized approach could significantly improve the effectiveness of online learning.\n\nHowever, FACS is not without its flaws.  Its accuracy in interpreting facial expressions is imperfect, potentially misidentifying emotions and leading to inappropriate adjustments to the learning material. For instance, a student might be confused about something unrelated to the course, yet FACS might misinterpret this as confusion with the lesson itself.  Furthermore, students could manipulate the system by feigning emotions to access easier content designed for those requiring additional assistance. This potential for manipulation undermines the integrity of online assessments and personalized learning pathways.\n\nUltimately, the potential for misinterpretation and manipulation outweighs the theoretical benefits of FACS in an educational setting.",

If so, I highly recommend joining the Seagoing Cowboys program for three compelling reasons. By participating in this program, you will be able to visit distinct locations that few others get the chance to explore.\n\nFirst and foremost, while some people may prefer staying at home or have already traveled extensively, I promise you that the experience is well worth it. Many of your trips with the Seagoing Cowboys will focus on maritime adventures. This means you'll be surrounded by water and enjoy sights not commonly seen by others. At this point, I hope you're intrigued about joining us on such journeys.\n\nSecondly, another reason to join is because it's loads of fun. While feeding animals can be a challenging task at times, it provides relief from boredom during long stretches at sea. Even if you're not particularly fond of animals, there's still plenty for you to explore if you're willing! Spending time with animals and feeding them when necessary can be quite engaging. During nighttime assignments, you'll need to check on them hourly\u2014ensuring that they don't roam freely around the ship disrupting personal belongings.\n\nFinally, consider joining because there are experiences in this program that are simply unmatched elsewhere\u2014you won\u2019t find these opportunities on an ordinary day! Whether it\u2019s staying up all night watching over animals or spending months out at sea; these adventures allow participants experiences beyond typical life routines.\n\nTo sum up: by enrolling in the Seagoing Cowboys program you'll witness incredible destinations new discoveries await alongside immense enjoyment achieved through new activities impossible otherwise\u2014a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity awaits; seize it!",
        "Let me help restructure and correct this text to improve its flow, grammar, and factual accuracy. Here's a revised version:\n\n```\nOn May 24, 2001, while operating the Viking 1 spacecraft's cameras over Mars at NASA, I witnessed something extraordinary. In one of our surveillance frames, a peculiar formation caught my eye\u2014what appeared to be a face-like structure on the planet's surface.\n\nStunned by what I was seeing, I captured multiple images of the formation to verify my initial observation. Each photo showed the same intriguing feature. Excited by this discovery, I rushed to share it with my colleague down the hall, who was equally amazed by what he saw.\n\nAfter studying the image for over half an hour, my colleague immediately jumped to conclusions, declaring, \"Aliens made it!\"",
        "The rapid advancement of technology, while often beneficial, raises concerns about privacy, especially in sensitive environments like classrooms.  The article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" which promotes emotion-recognition software like the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), fails to convincingly argue for its classroom implementation. In fact, it inadvertently highlights the significant privacy invasion such technology represents.  The article suggests classrooms could use FACS to detect student confusion or boredom and adjust lessons accordingly, mimicking a human instructor.  This premise, however, is flawed.\n\nThe analogy between FACS and a human instructor is weak. While the article notes that humans can often gauge emotions through facial expressions, this overlooks the richness of human interaction.  A teacher's presence offers more than just facial cues; their body language, tone of voice, and ability to respond to individual questions in real-time are crucial for effective teaching.  Moreover, studies show that many students learn better with direct teacher interaction than online, rendering the software's proposed benefits less impactful.  Replacing a teacher's nuanced understanding with software that merely tracks basic emotions would likely be detrimental to the learning process.\n\nFurther illustrating the disconnect between FACS and classroom needs, the article presents a jarring example: if a student smiles at an online ad, similar ads will follow.  This example, intended to showcase the technology's capabilities, instead exposes its invasive nature within the educational context.  It raises the alarming prospect of students being constantly monitored and their responses tracked, even for non-educational purposes.  Imagine this scenario playing out in classrooms, where students' emotional responses to their work are constantly scrutinized and potentially used for purposes beyond learning.  This is a clear breach of privacy.\n\nThe article's argument weakens further when it suggests FACS can personalize learning by adjusting to student emotions.  This ignores the existing reality in many schools, like Floyd Central High School, where students already use iPads for learning.  Adding emotion-recognition software wouldn't significantly enhance the personalized learning experience, but it would dramatically increase the potential for privacy violations.\n\nUltimately, the integration of FACS into classrooms offers little educational value while posing significant privacy risks.  It's a costly and time-consuming endeavor that would be better directed towards proven methods of enhancing student learning.  Instead of relying on emotion-reading software, schools should focus on providing adequate teacher support and resources that foster a positive and privacy-respecting learning environment.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" phenomenon remains one of space exploration's most intriguing cases of pareidolia, though some still believe it to be an alien monument despite scientific evidence to the contrary. When NASA first discovered this formation, it certainly caught the attention of mission controllers. However, they quickly identified it as a Martian mesa\u2014a common geological feature in the Cydonia region\u2014whose shadows happened to create the appearance of an Egyptian Pharaoh's face.\n\nWhen NASA released the initial photograph to the public, they captioned it as a \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" While this caption was designed to generate public interest, it inadvertently fueled speculation about potential extraterrestrial origins. Some theorists suggested NASA was concealing evidence of Martian life. However, such claims are illogical\u2014NASA's budget would actually benefit from discovering extraterrestrial life, making any concealment counterproductive.\n\nOn April 5, 1998, NASA deployed the Mars Global Surveyor to capture images of Cydonia with ten times the resolution of the original photographs. These enhanced images were promptly uploaded to JPL's website, accompanied by explanations confirming the formation's natural origins. Yet, skeptics remained unconvinced.\n\nIn response, NASA conducted another detailed inspection using advanced imaging technology capable of 1.56-meter maximum resolution. The resulting high-definition photographs definitively revealed the formation to be equivalent to an Earth-like butte or mesa\u2014a natural geological structure common to both planets.\n\nWhile the initial enthusiasm for potential evidence of Martian life is understandable, NASA has consistently provided scientific evidence demonstrating the formation's natural origins. Through three separate imaging missions, each with increasing resolution capable of detecting artificial structures like aircraft or pyramids if present, the data consistently shows a natural geological formation.\n\nThe Face on Mars serves as a compelling reminder that scientific evidence, not speculation, should guide our understanding of astronomical phenomena. While theories about extraterrestrial structures may capture our imagination, they must ultimately yield to empirical evidence and scientific investigation.",
        "**Driverless Cars and Their Risks**\n\nThe concept of driverless cars does not appeal to me whatsoever. Trusting technology with something as important as driving is nothing short of dangerous. Think of it this way: do you know that feeling when your computer freezes or when your television goes out? TVs and computers are some of the basic essentials of technology. They have their bugs and do not run flawlessly 24/7. Driverless cars can be the same way. They can freeze and have their bugs. Are you willing to risk the lives of you and your loved ones with a driverless car? I certainly wouldn't, and by the end of this essay, I hope you won't risk it either. \n\nDriverless cars have been fantasized about for many years. Google employees, such as Sergey Brin and Sebastian Thrun, claim that this fantasy is close to becoming a reality. I, for one, haven't really heard any concrete news on the matter. Sure, the rumors were there, but I honestly haven't seen any of these breakthroughs. I, and many other people, want to see true facts and real results. The fantasy of driverless cars clouds people's judgment, and with such little public attention and news coverage, I can see why I and so many others are skeptical of this idea. \n\nTechnology, as we know, is nothing short of unpredictable. A phone can shut down, a computer can catch a virus, and a TV can blow out. Who knows what a driverless car can do? At least, if a car breaks down, the human driver has some degree of control over the matter. To have that control taken away and replaced by a computer program is, frankly, frightening. A car can be dangerous if in the wrong hands. I don't believe the hands of a lifeless computer program are a good substitute for a human driver.",
        "My stance on driverless cars is that I do not support their presence on the road due to the potential for accidents and injuries or even death. Additionally, they can lead to serious disruptions in someone's life if they were to be harmed by a driverless car.\n\nDriverless cars lack the quick response capabilities that humans possess while driving. In adverse weather conditions, such as slick roads, their inability to adjust speed accordingly could result in accidents. The question arises: in the event of an accident involving a driverless car, who would be at fault? Should the company that manufactured the car bear responsibility and face legal action if a human driver did not cause the incident? Or should blame fall on the human operator since they are actively driving? I believe that full responsibility should lie with the company behind the manufacturing of these vehicles.\n\nDriverless cars have the potential to malfunction and lead to severe or life-threatening collisions for other drivers involved. Many individuals oppose these autonomous vehicles being permitted on roads out of concern for safety risks and potential harm. Despite having humans available as backup operators, I still believe that creating driverless cars poses unnecessary safety hazards and financial waste if these advanced vehicles were to incur irreparable damage.\n\nIf laws are enacted governing driverless cars in this 21st century era, liability would likely rest with manufacturers in cases of malfunctions or when human operators fail to recognize imminent dangers ahead. Those outside of a collision situation who are aware of their actions would likely not be held accountable compared to automated systems lacking awareness.",
        "Venus, often called the \"Evening Star,\" presents a paradox.  While relatively close to Earth, it remains a hostile and unexplored world.  We haven't sent a spacecraft there in 30 years, and for good reason.  Its thick atmosphere, composed of 97% carbon dioxide and laced with corrosive sulfuric acid clouds, creates a hellish environment.  Surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit \u2013 hotter than any other planet in our solar system \u2013 and the atmospheric pressure is a crushing 90 times that of Earth. These conditions are far beyond anything humans can withstand.\n\nGiven this extreme environment, why return to Venus?  Astronomers believe that Venus may once have been Earth-like, potentially covered with oceans and capable of supporting life.  Even today, Venus exhibits familiar geological features like mountains and valleys, hinting at a more hospitable past.\n\nThis potential for discovery drives renewed interest in Venus exploration.  NASA is developing innovative solutions to overcome the challenges. One concept involves deploying a research station that would float approximately 30 miles above the surface, safe from the extreme ground conditions.  They are also investigating technologies like mechanically driven devices, inspired by World War II designs, capable of operating under high pressures and temperatures without electricity.\n\nThe allure of Venus lies in our innate human curiosity and drive to explore.  We possess boundless imaginations, and to truly progress as a civilization, we should strive to become a multi-planetary species.  Innovation and learning have propelled us from the first automobiles a century ago to where we are today.  Imagine the possibilities that await us in the next 100 years, perhaps including a deeper understanding of our enigmatic neighbor, Venus.",
        "**Title: The Debate on Driverless Cars**\n\nThe concept of driverless cars has sparked significant debate, with tech visionaries like Google cofounder Sergey Brin advocating for their use in public transportation and taxi systems. Brin envisions driverless cars as a revolutionary approach to modern transportation, promising to use half the fuel of today's taxis while offering more flexibility than a bus. However, the safety and practicality of these vehicles remain contentious.\n\n**Safety Concerns and Challenges**\n\nCritics argue that driverless cars pose safety hazards and, therefore, shouldn't be allowed on the road. One significant concern is the potential for malfunctions. If a driverless car experiences a technical issue while in motion, it could endanger the passengers and other road users. The current discourse lacks clarity on how these cars would handle situations like accidents or mechanical damage. This absence of a human driver, capable of making quick, intelligent, and perceptual judgments, underscores the argument that driverless cars, as of now, cannot replicate the \"smartness and physical view and skills as a human do.\"\n\n**Potential Benefits and Safety Features**\n\nOn the other hand, driverless cars could offer unprecedented convenience, allowing humans to relax, eat, or check a text message while on the road. These cars, equipped with advanced sensors, could potentially detect and mitigate dangers, including out-of-control skids and rollovers, by accelerating and, if necessary, stopping the car.",
        "As a 15-year-old girl, I have yet to experience driving a driverless car, so I am unsure how much I would like them. Personally, I don't think they are a great idea. I believe that if someone thinks they can take on the responsibility of driving, they should be fully capable of performing all the tasks involved. What if a driverless car happens to malfunction? The possibilities of things going wrong are endless with driverless cars.\n\nIf you believe you are ready to drive, you should be familiar with all the necessary tasks and be capable of performing them while driving. The driver should be responsible, highly aware of their surroundings, and always alert. If you think you should be driving, you must be accountable for yourself and others around you. Not only is your life at stake, but so are theirs. You shouldn't have to rely on electronics and computers to assist you, as that may lead you to forget the rules of driving.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think it would be amazing if we didn't have to drive ourselves. Not having to worry about looking both ways or getting into a crash sounds appealing. However, in reality, we just can't trust it. What if, for instance, the anti-lock brakes malfunction in the middle of the highway, and a crash results, killing five people?",
        "Twenty-five years ago, something oddly strange happened on Mars. The NASA spacecraft, Viking 1, captured a photo on the red planet that bore a striking resemblance to a human face. This discovery led many to speculate that aliens were involved, but various facts counter this theory.

This innovative system could revolutionize education by addressing student engagement and comprehension while also offering insights into emotional recognition in social situations.\n\n## Enhancing Educational Experience\n\nThe technology's potential in educational settings is particularly promising. As Dr. Huang notes, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" This capability could transform learning outcomes by enabling real-time adjustments to teaching methods and content delivery, potentially increasing student engagement and comprehension significantly.\n\n## Personalized Advertising Experience\n\nFACS also offers practical applications in digital advertising. The system's ability to read facial expressions could streamline the user experience by customizing content based on emotional responses. As mentioned in the passage, \"If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" This feature could eliminate the frustration of manually dismissing unwanted advertisements while ensuring users see more relevant content.\n\n## Historical and Cultural Applications\n\nThe technology's potential extends to historical and cultural analysis as well. Art historians and educators could benefit from analyzing emotional expressions in historical paintings, providing new insights into artistic interpretation and historical context.",
        "Venus, the second planet from our sun, is often referred to as Earth's twin due to its similar size and density. However, the similarities largely end there. Venus has a harsh atmosphere composed of 97% carbon dioxide, clouds of sulfuric acid, and the hottest surface temperature of any planet orbiting the sun. Despite these challenges, scientists have endeavored to send unmanned spacecraft to Venus, intrigued by the possibility that it may once have been the most Earth-like planet, featuring valleys, mountains, and evidence of ancient oceans.\n\nThe author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers, by highlighting the planet's similarities to Earth and its proximity to our planet. The text mentions, \"...Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This suggests the potential that Venus, at some point, may have harbored conditions suitable for life, making the exploration of Venus a valuable endeavor. Additionally, the author notes, \"...recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.\"",
        "Driverless cars have both positive and negative aspects, but I personally do not think that we should have them on our streets. Multiple states have already outlawed the testing of driverless cars, and I am siding with those states. Driverless cars are dangerous, they will make people even lazier than they already are, and a lot of people probably would not be able to afford these cars.\n\nOne major concern is the safety risk. Driverless cars are dangerous because everything is controlled by a computer; the passenger is not in control at all times. Traffic laws state that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. If there is a passenger in a driverless car and it begins to malfunction resulting in injury or even death, whose fault will it be? The passenger or the manufacturer?\n\nAdditionally, driverless cars just make things so much more complicated. I think most people would rather drive their own cars anyway because they feel more secure being in control rather than having a computer manage everything for them.\n\nAnother issue with driverless technology is its potential to exacerbate societal laziness. People in this country already dislike doing things for themselves; having driverless cars will only worsen this tendency. If people do not have to drive, then they might neglect other responsibilities as well. Not having to drive just leads to more lazy actions down the road; driving should remain one of those essential tasks individuals must perform themselves.\n\nFurthermore, there's an economic aspect to consider\u2014manual vehicles are already expensive enough as it is; it's hard to imagine how costly driverless models might become if introduced on public roads today! Who would truly afford such innovation except perhaps affluent individuals? Hence investing heavily into developing these autonomous automobiles appears wasteful when considering limited accessibility across various income brackets nationwide!",
        "Venus, the second planet from our sun (paragraph one), presents a fascinating challenge for space exploration.  The author's interest in Venus is evident through the detailed information presented about the planet, including its extreme surface temperatures.  As stated in paragraph three, \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,\" making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system.  This extreme heat contributes to the planet's hostile environment, which explains why \"not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades\" (paragraph two).  The author emphasizes the difficulty of exploring Venus, noting that even metal cannot survive on its surface, and any potential human visit would require floating approximately 30 miles above the ground.\n\nThe varying orbital speeds of Venus, Earth, and Mars (paragraph two) affect their relative proximity to each other, with Earth sometimes closer to Mars and other times to Venus.  This dynamic adds complexity to any mission targeting Venus.\n\nDespite these challenges, Venus remains a compelling target for exploration.  NASA continues to develop innovative solutions for a potential human mission, as highlighted in the passage. \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\" (paragraph seven).",
        "\"Unmasking the Face on Mars\"\n\nThe article \"On the Face on Mars\" presents a compelling blend of facts and opinions.  In 1976, while the Viking 1 spacecraft orbited Mars, photographing potential landing sites for Viking 2, it captured something unusual.  The spacecraft discovered what appeared to be an enormous face-like structure, nearly two miles long.  While some NASA scientists dismissed it as a typical Martian mesa, the image sparked speculation.  Could this be a natural landform, or did it hint at another life form?\n\nThe structure's shadows gave it an uncanny resemblance to an Egyptian Pharaoh.  NASA's official explanation, released days later, described the image as a \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"  Despite this, some continued to believe the face was artificially constructed. However, numerous natural processes could have created such a formation.  The article explores several possibilities, including the erosive effects of Martian winter weather and draws a comparison to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain.",
        "Professor Thomas Huang, along with Professor Nicu Sebe, are the masterminds behind the Facial Action Coding System, a revolutionary technology that can detect and analyze human emotions based on facial expressions. By utilizing a 3-D model of the face and focusing on the 44 major facial muscles, the system can accurately identify a wide range of emotions, from happiness and sadness to anger and fear.\n\nThe technology's capabilities extend beyond just recognizing individual emotions; it can also identify mixed emotions within a single facial expression. For example, a person may appear happy but also exhibit signs of fear, and the system is able to pick up on these subtle nuances. This level of detail was demonstrated when the system was applied to the iconic Mona Lisa painting, accurately assessing the various emotions present and assigning percentages to each.\n\nWhile the Facial Action Coding System represents a significant advancement in the field of emotional detection, it is not infallible. Like any technology, it has the potential to experience errors or inaccuracies, and it is important not to rely on it as the sole source of emotional analysis. Despite this, the system holds great promise, particularly in educational settings, where it could be a valuable tool for students to learn about the intricacies of facial expressions and the emotions they convey.\n\nIn the classroom, the Facial Action Coding System could provide a hands-on learning experience, allowing students to not only observe the emotions portrayed by the system, but also to understand the specific facial muscles and movements responsible for each expression. This interactive approach to emotional analysis could enhance the students' comprehension and appreciation of the complexities of human emotions, making the technology a valuable asset in the educational sphere.",
        "Smart cars offer significant safety advantages.  Consider a driver momentarily distracted by a child, perhaps handing them a toy.  Without smart features, there's nothing to prevent a potential accident if their eyes are off the road.  Smart cars, with features like automatic emergency braking, can mitigate these risks and likely reduce both the frequency and severity of accidents, saving lives.\n\nThe automated features also offer convenience.  Parking assistance can simplify a sometimes frustrating task.  More importantly, smart car technology can counteract the dangerous behaviors of impaired or distracted drivers, preventing accidents caused by texting or driving under the influence.\n\nFurthermore, the development of smart cars stimulates investment in automotive safety technology.  The revenue generated allows manufacturers to continually improve these systems, making cars safer for everyone, including teen drivers and young children.\n\nMy primary motivation for supporting the development of driverless cars is the increased safety they provide.  These technologies can prevent accidents caused by inattention, offering drivers a crucial safety net and giving passengers, particularly children, a safer and more enjoyable travel experience.  By minimizing the risks associated with human error, smart car technology creates a more secure environment for all road users.  Therefore, I believe the development and implementation of driverless car technology is crucial for improving road safety today.",
        "The invention of this new device could be beneficial in numerous ways. I believe it could aid in studying how students react to various activities conducted online or in class, as well as in expressing their emotions in general. Additionally, it could assist in taking preventive measures for children and students who are experiencing depression and in need of help. This innovative technology offers a plethora of uses. Not only can it serve as a facial decoding system, but it can also provide insights into students' emotional states.\n\nAs mentioned, the Facial Action Coding System can be applied not only in studying students but also in observing babies and adults. This device could be particularly beneficial for disabled children and adults, as well as children with birth defects and syndromes. It could help them in understanding emotions and in recognizing when someone is angry, sad, and so forth, and perhaps in learning how to express emotions in a suitable manner.\n\nRegarding the analysis of students' facial expressions, it can be instrumental in discovering methods to make learning more engaging and in simplifying certain activities. It can also influence how teachers approach their work and teaching. For instance, students in special education programs might not find online tasks as straightforward as their peers, and they could become frustrated and discouraged.",
        "Throughout history, advanced technology has been a universal pursuit. While it has proven highly effective, it has also introduced numerous problems.\n\nThere are certain aspects of life that \"man\" should control themselves, with driving being one of them. Although assembly lines have made it easier to transport heavy items to their destinations, completely removing a human from the operation of a potentially lethal vehicle is not only lazy but also absurd. Humans possess a unique asset that sets them apart from all other creatures: a brain.\n\nAs highlighted, in the event of an accident, who should be held accountable? The \"driver\" or the robot controlling the vehicle? While a car may have an override system, a human may not be able to react quickly enough in the chaotic split second that a robot-induced situation may create.\n\nHowever, there are specific scenarios where robots may excel, such as in the case of a \"whiskey throttle.\" This occurs when a human, in a panic, applies excessive pressure to the accelerator, leading to an unintended accident. Robots, in contrast, do not panic, ensuring they will not rear-end the car in front of them.\n\nI fully support safety, but allowing a robot to have complete, total control over a car is not a measure I endorse.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\" may look like an alien has constructed it but the shadows of the bumps make it seem like it is an actual human face. If aliens had created this form, wouldn't there be more of these human-looking landforms? The answer to that question would be yes. The pictures from 2001 show that the artifact was really just a natural creation. Before scientists had found the Face on Mars, the question is... just how old is it?\n\nIn the beginning of the article, it states, \"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa\" (UTFONM, 1). Thus meaning that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. Before scientists had access to pictures in 1976 and '98 with awful quality, a clearer image in 2001 showed exactly what the Face on Mars truly represents. The article also stated that the Face on Mars \"...huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth\" (UTFONM, 1). This is proof that it only exists as a natural landform.\n\nIf aliens were responsible for creating such structures on Mars, wouldn't there have been more similar formations? There's no evidence suggesting aliens were involved in crafting the Face on Mars within this article. If indeed alien beings were behind its creation, NASA would likely have explored and documented it extensively instead of concealing such a discovery for financial gain. According to information presented in this article; \"Meanwhile defenders of NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars\" (UTFONM), implying benefits arising from such extraterrestrial involvement.\n\nIt might be intriguing to consider whether beings capable of space travel could have constructed such structures; however,\"There was no alien monument after all\" according to this source (UTFONM).",
        "My name is Bob Greene, and I am a scientist at NASA. I am discussing the \"Face on Mars\" with a man who believes it is evidence of an alien artifact. Despite my explanations, he insists that aliens are real and that this feature resembles a human face. I repeatedly explain that the formation is a natural landform known as a butte or mesa. It appears facial because shadows create the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. \n\nThe man questions how NASA can be sure that the formation is a mesa, implying it's a sign of alien life. I clarify that a mesa is a large rock formation with a flat top, which is exactly how the \"face\" appears up close. Nonetheless, he remains skeptical. I assure him that the truth will be revealed, and indeed, it is. \n\nOn April 8, 2001, the NASA team, myself included, obtained a clear image of the \"face\" with the Mars Global Surveyor. The Surveyor, having a perfect, cloudless day, captured a photo that was significantly clearer than the original 1976 Viking photo. \n\nMany who believed the \"face\" was an alien artifact eagerly awaited the release of the new image. NASA, eventually, revealed the photo, which, as the evidence confirmed, depicted a mesa. While the image disappointed some, a few, the man I debated, included, suspected a NASA conspiracy to conceal the truth about aliens.",
        "The idea of automated control has been a topic of discussion in various contexts, from border control turrets to androids, and has also been a popular theme in science fiction films like The Matrix and iRobot, where artificial intelligence (A.I.) takes control over humanity. However, potential issues arise with the implementation of automated cars, raising questions about whether A.I. should drive or humans, ultimately boiling down to a comparison of human error versus the limited thought capacity of a computer.\n\nOn one hand, automated cars have the potential to save lives, as a significant number of yearly car crash fatalities are caused by drunk or distracted drivers. With automated cars, human impairment, such as being drunk, would not affect the car's performance, potentially reducing car-related deaths, as speeding and car chases would be eliminated. This presents a strong argument in favor of automated cars, as they could significantly enhance road safety.\n\nNevertheless, the uncertainties surrounding automated cars, particularly in emergency situations, where the A.I. may not know how to react, raise concerns, as human intervention and decision-making capabilities could be crucial.",
        "Twenty-five years after the initial discovery in 1976 of an unusual face-like landform on Mars, located at 41 degrees north Martian latitude, the mystery surrounding it has been largely resolved.  While some initially speculated about it being an alien artifact, scientists recognized it as a natural formation.  As described at the time, \"The caption noted a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" This explanation pointed to the interplay of light and shadow creating the human-like appearance, rather than any extraterrestrial construction.\n\nTo further confirm this, in 1998 and again in 2001, NASA utilized advanced technology to capture higher resolution images of the landform. These newer images provided conclusive evidence, dispelling the notion of alien involvement and reinforcing the initial understanding that the \"face\" was a product of natural geological processes and the angle of the sunlight.",

While the technology promises convenience, there are legitimate concerns about safety, cost, and liability that need to be addressed.\n\nSafety remains a paramount concern. Even with current human drivers who exceed speed limits, there's at least personal accountability. In autonomous vehicles, if someone manages to override the speed controls while not paying attention to the road, the risk of accidents increases. Additionally, the reliance on technology raises its own safety concerns\u2014what happens if critical sensors malfunction or the guidance systems fail?\n\nThe human element in driving shouldn't be underestimated. While technology can be reliable, human drivers can make split-second decisions based on complex environmental factors. If a vehicle's sensors malfunction or its navigation systems fail, the consequences could be severe. This suggests that human drivers might still be more efficient and adaptable than autonomous systems.\n\nCost presents another significant barrier. Manufacturing autonomous vehicles requires sophisticated components and technology, substantially increasing production costs.",
        "Driverless cars present several significant challenges that warrant serious consideration before widespread development and adoption.  These concerns, primarily focused on technological reliability, safety implications, and the potential erosion of essential driving skills, collectively suggest that further development should proceed with caution.\n\nThe core issue lies in the inherent fallibility of technology.  As any technology can malfunction, driverless cars are susceptible to crashes and system errors. This raises critical questions of liability.  If a technological failure leads to an accident, who bears responsibility \u2013 the \"driver\" or the manufacturer? This legal and ethical grey area remains unresolved. While convenience is a strong selling point for driverless technology, ease of use should not overshadow fundamental safety concerns.\n\nThese safety concerns are amplified by the potential for sensor failures, which could lead to collisions.  Furthermore, the widespread adoption of driverless cars could lead to a decline in driving skills among the general population. If driving licenses become unnecessary, the essential knowledge and experience required to operate a vehicle could diminish, potentially creating a dangerous situation in emergencies or if autonomous systems fail.\n\nThis lack of knowledge and experience ties directly into the potential for increased societal laziness. While not everyone would become complacent, the convenience of driverless cars could discourage many from actively maintaining their driving skills. This over-reliance on technology could have detrimental consequences in the long run, limiting individual autonomy and potentially hindering responses to unforeseen circumstances.  We should strive to enhance, not diminish, essential life skills.",

All these emotions can be analyzed through computer recognition. While computers can now quantify emotional states as percentages, humans naturally interpret each other's emotions daily. For instance, when a close friend or family member appears gloomy, we typically recognize their emotional state immediately. Though we might struggle to describe specific emotional traits precisely, we intuitively understand them.\n\nThis technology aims to bridge gaps in human connection and understanding through the tools we use daily. Is there anything wrong with that goal?\n\n*Key improvements made:*",
        "In 1976, scientists made a startling discovery in Cydonia, a region on Mars. NASA's Viking 1 orbiter, while photographing potential landing sites for its sister ship, Viking 2, captured an image resembling a human face. This sparked immediate debate, with some believing it to be an alien monument and others attributing it to a natural landform.\n\nSubsequent analysis has definitively proven the \"Face on Mars\" to be a natural formation, analogous to a butte or mesa, common landforms in the American West.  Despite this scientific consensus, some remain unconvinced.  Conspiracy theories, lacking credibility, allege a NASA cover-up, suggesting the agency is hiding evidence of extraterrestrial life. Ironically, proponents of continued NASA funding might have welcomed evidence of an ancient Martian civilization.  The \"Face\" captivated public interest, and NASA prioritized capturing higher-resolution images.\n\nOn April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor finally provided a definitive answer.  Its Mars Orbiter Camera, operated by Michael Malin, captured an image ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed no alien monument, only a natural landform.\n\nAfter eighteen years of investigation, most researchers concluded the matter.

This discovery quickly became intertwined with theories about extraterrestrial life, as many believers cited it as compelling evidence of alien civilization on the Red Planet.\n\nThe original photograph depicted a region of Mars containing several geological formations, but one particular feature stood out dramatically. Shot at a specific angle and lighting condition, shadows created what appeared to be facial features on a mesa-like structure. Enthusiasts interpreted this as a monument crafted by extraterrestrial beings, comparing it to earthly landforms like the buttes and mesas common throughout the American West.\n\nHowever, skeptics presented compelling counterarguments. They pointed out that attributing complex meaning to natural rock formations was premature, especially given Mars's well-documented geological processes. The likelihood of artificially creating a human-like face on a distant planet posed significant logical and physical challenges.\n\nSubsequent high-resolution imaging has provided clarity to the debate. NASA captured additional photos in 1998 and 2001, with the 2001 image offering unprecedented detail of the formation. This clearer view revealed a markedly different picture: rather than a human face, the formation more closely resembled a lion-like shape. More importantly, the enhanced resolution exposed natural geological features that explained the face-like appearance in the original photograph.\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" ultimately proved to be a classic example of pareidolia\u2014the human tendency to perceive familiar patterns, particularly faces, in random stimuli. What was once heralded as evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence was revealed to be nothing more than an interesting natural formation, captured at a particular angle and lighting condition that created a momentarily compelling illusion.",
        "Autonomous vehicles hold potential, but significant safety concerns remain.  The lack of driver engagement poses several risks.  Drivers with nothing to do may become complacent, falling asleep or losing focus, rendering them unprepared to take control in emergencies.  This disengagement could also lead to increased distractions and risky behavior within the vehicle.  Maintaining driver attention is crucial for the safety of everyone on the road.\n\nFurthermore, the reliability of autonomous systems is a major concern.  Like any complex technology, these systems are susceptible to malfunctions and breakdowns.  Manufacturing defects, software glitches, or sensor failures could have disastrous consequences.  A malfunctioning GPS, for example, could lead drivers far off course, while a critical system failure could leave the driver stranded or worse.\n\nConsider this scenario: You're enjoying a lively conversation in your autonomous vehicle, completely unaware of an approaching hazard requiring driver intervention.  The system, designed to alert you, malfunctions.  The car continues autonomously, believing you're in control, and tragically strikes a construction worker.  The result?  Significant financial and legal repercussions.\n\nThese examples highlight the inherent dangers: driver inattention, system malfunctions, and the potential for unforeseen circumstances.  Relying on autonomous technology could foster a culture of complacency, particularly among younger drivers, teaching them to abdicate responsibility.

        "Can you believe that there is a face on Mars? The Face on Mars, while intriguing, is not actually a face but a natural landform. There are several reasons supporting this conclusion: the facial features are merely shadows, there is no concrete evidence of alien involvement, and scientific research has debunked the idea of extraterrestrial creation.\n\nFirstly, the facial features are nothing more than shadows cast by rock formations. While it may be enticing to imagine an alien origin for such an enigmatic image, reality dictates otherwise. Research has confirmed that it is simply a large rock formation. In fact, \"The authors proposed using this as a means to engage public interest in Mars\" (Paragraph 3).\n\nSecondly, there is no definitive proof that aliens were responsible for creating this formation. Speculation about alien involvement lacks substantial evidence since the existence of aliens itself remains unproven. As stated in one article: \"Some skeptics suggest that any alleged alien markings might be obscured by haze\" (Paragraph 8).\n\nLastly, scientists have conducted studies discrediting the notion of extraterrestrial intervention in shaping the Martian face. A photograph taken during April 1998 winter showed how challenging it would have been to capture such an image through wispy clouds (Paragraph 8).\n\nThe allure behind attributing the Martian face to aliens stems from humanity's desire to believe in otherworldly beings. It serves as a testament to our curiosity about potential life beyond Earth's boundaries but leaves us uncertain about its authenticity.\n\nWhile opinions may vary on this subject, I personally believe that the Martian face is simply a geological feature based on concrete evidence: shadow-like facial characteristics, scientific scrutiny debunking alien theories and lack of conclusive proof regarding extraterrestrial involvement.

There are various perspectives to consider, but which one would you lean towards? I believe that driving a car is much more enjoyable, especially for teenagers who are just starting out with driving. It would also be safer if we had more control over the vehicle, rather than letting it function independently. These reasons contribute to my preference for driving a car over using an automated system.\n\nImagine a sunny day where a teenager sets off on their first drive towards the beach with friends \u2013 an experience that driverless cars cannot replicate. \"For starters, you need numerous sensors.\" These sensors could take up valuable space in the car, making it difficult to accommodate luggage or other belongings, and potentially complicating usage for young drivers.\n\nI find the act of driving a car inherently enjoyable because \"all these systems are designed to alert drivers when human intervention is necessary.\" Only dealing with challenging road conditions during manual driving can be tough and frustrating \u2013 taking away from the overall enjoyment of the experience. Moreover, having \"a whole lot of sensors\" could significantly increase costs and maintenance requirements beyond what most households can handle. Unlike traditional cars that can be fixed relatively easily if something goes wrong, any malfunction in the computerized system of driverless cars renders them unusable until repaired by specialized technicians.\n\nAnother crucial aspect is safety and efficient traffic flow; without driverless cars around us, \"information systems utilizing heads-up displays\" wouldn't interrupt traffic patterns unnecessarily or slow down vehicles behind them due to distracted passengers onboard texting or delayed response times while switching between autonomous and manual modes.",
        "Self-driving cars may have a place in the future, but I don't see them becoming mainstream anytime soon. While Google's autonomous vehicles offer numerous advantages, several drawbacks hinder their widespread adoption.  Though they represent a novel form of transportation, I believe traditional taxis will remain prevalent for the foreseeable future.\n\nOne significant concern is the requirement for drivers or passengers to remain fully aware of their surroundings. If constant vigilance is necessary, it raises questions about the true autonomy of these vehicles and their overall safety for public roads.  While the potential environmental benefits, such as halving fuel consumption compared to taxis, are substantial and could significantly reduce humanity's carbon footprint, safety for passengers and other vehicles must be Google's top priority.\n\nI acknowledge the potential of self-driving technology to revolutionize the taxi industry.  However, I believe widespread adoption is still years away.",
        "The author asserts that exploring Venus would be worthwhile despite the risks, but this claim is not well-supported. The focus is predominantly on the dangers of traveling to Venus rather than emphasizing the significance of exploration. For instance, the author highlights challenges such as \"the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere\" and notes that \"the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet,\" suggesting that exploring Venus is nearly impossible due to its extreme conditions.\n\nIn paragraph 3, the author elaborates on these difficulties by stating, \"Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" This effectively summarizes how current technology falls short for a successful mission to Venus. The statement that \"such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans\" further underscores scientists' limitations with existing technology.\n\nSupport for why traveling to Venus might be valuable primarily hinges on its similarities with Earth. In paragraph 4, it's noted that \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" However, suggesting exploration based solely on these similarities does not adequately justify the substantial financial investment required for such an endeavor. Additionally, while it may be true that Venus is one of Earth's closest planetary neighbors worth visiting due to proximity alone doesn't negate its inhospitable nature.",
        "Today, I aim to debunk the claim that aliens created the Face on the red planet Mars. The primary flaw in your argument is the assumption that the Face on Mars is of extraterrestrial origin. The Face depicted in the image is simply an oddly shaped Martian mesa, a common feature in that region. It is entirely possible that there are more such mesas in the area.\n\nYou seem to have misinterpreted the image caption or perhaps overlooked it altogether. Had you paid attention, you would have noted that the caption explains the resemblance to a human head as a result of the shadows, creating the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The image was likely shared to generate more interest in Mars.\n\nAdditionally, on April 5, 1998, NASA officially confirmed on their website that the Face was merely a naturally occurring, peculiarly shaped landform.\n\nIn summary, there are multiple ways to refute the notion that the Face on Mars is of alien origin. Firstly, the structure is a mesa, lacking a distinct, intentional form, meaning that a similar formation could resemble a dog or a cat. Secondly, the caption, if read, clarifies that the Face's appearance is the result of the play of shadows, creating the illusion of facial features. These points conclusively establish the Face as a natural, rather than a man-made, formation.",

        "There is minimal evidence to support the notion that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. However, there is substantial evidence suggesting that the Face is nothing more than a natural landform. Similar landforms can be found on Earth, and high-quality images have been captured showing a typical geological feature on the surface of Mars.\n\nOne key reason why we can confidently conclude that the Face was not crafted by extraterrestrial beings lies in its resemblance to Earth's landforms. The Face closely resembles mesas, which are common in regions like the American West. Jim Garvin, NASA's chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program, highlighted these similarities: \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho... That's a lava dome forming an isolated mesa roughly similar in height to the Face on Mars.\" The uncanny resemblance between the Face and known natural formations on Earth strongly suggests that it too is a product of natural geological processes.\n\nFurthermore, advancements in imaging technology have provided clearer views of this enigmatic structure since 1976. In 1998, during a flyby over Cydonia where the Face is situated, researchers led by Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured an image ten times sharper than earlier ones. This higher resolution image revealed no signs of artificial manipulation but rather showcased a typical geological feature. Subsequent photos taken with improved resolution further dispelled any lingering doubts about alien involvement.\n\nDespite these findings, skeptics remained unconvinced and hypothesized that obscured \"alien markings\" may have been masked by atmospheric conditions such as haze or clouds. However, subsequent observations made during clear weather conditions using advanced imaging techniques discredited such claims entirely.",
        "Venus, often referred to as Earth's twin due to its similarity in density and size, is a planet that holds great intrigue for scientists. Despite its similarities to Earth, Venus harbors numerous dangers that make exploration a challenging endeavor. With an atmosphere composed of 97 percent carbon dioxide, surface temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that of Earth, Venus presents formidable obstacles to human exploration. Additionally, the planet is marked by erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes, further complicating any attempts to study it firsthand.\n\nHowever, the potential benefits of exploring Venus are significant. Some scientists believe that Venus may have once supported life, with rocky terrain, valleys, mountains, and craters hinting at a possible past that resembled Earth. Understanding Venus, with its similarities and contrasts to our own planet, could provide valuable insights into planetary evolution and the search for habitable worlds beyond our solar system. In the event of a catastrophic incident on Earth, Venus could potentially serve as a refuge, making the exploration of this hostile planet a strategic priority for scientific inquiry and, potentially, human survival.\n\nTo overcome the challenges of Venus, scientists are developing innovative approaches, such as utilizing floating platforms to study the planet's atmosphere, and designing electronic devices capable of withstanding the extreme conditions on its surface, with the potential to operate for extended periods.",

        "Having driverless cars is a great idea, but it could also be bad. Although I believe the world could work better with these cars, I also think that these types of cars can be dangerous. Some people may be worried about the safety of these cars because at any moment in time there could be a glitch in the computer software, and that small glitch could cause an accident any second of any day. However, I am not worried about that, because even if one car has a glitch, there will be many other smart cars on the road to help avoid an accident. That's why these cars should definitely be on the road.\n\nIf businesses and manufacturers really wanted to, they could make these dream cars a reality. The cars that we have now are pretty close to being completely driver-independent. All we would need to do is give the cars a few more updated sensors to replace the drivers. The updated sensors would act as the human reflexes, therefore creating better driving conditions. Hopefully, this would create fewer wrecks or accidents. Also, these driverless cars should have updated satellites and cameras, so when there is a detour or road construction, it will automatically update the car's route, helping to ease traffic congestion. If these cars could have the best technology that's out there today, they would already be a success.",
        "Driverless cars are on the horizon, driven by advancements in technology, improved safety features, and a growing global acceptance of autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe core technology required for driverless cars already exists.  While the cost remains a barrier to widespread consumer adoption, the underlying systems are largely in place.  Google employees have noted the effectiveness of current smart road systems, and the company believes that ongoing upgrades bring driverless cars closer to market readiness.  One key area of development is the car's starting system.  Google has leveraged existing technology like the Toyota Prius's radar sensor, GPS receivers, and inertial motion sensors, combining them to create a system that mimics human driving behavior.\n\nSafety is a paramount concern, and a major driver of the shift toward autonomous vehicles.  Google's driverless car has logged over half a million miles without an accident, a feat rarely achieved by human drivers.  The enhanced safety features, such as alerts that prompt driver intervention when necessary and motion sensors that ensure driver attentiveness, represent a significant leap forward in automotive safety.\n\nBeyond technological feasibility and safety improvements, widespread acceptance of driverless cars is crucial for their success.  The underlying technology, such as sensors and radios, is already familiar; the innovation lies in their application to enhance vehicle operation and safety.  While there are potential energy savings through the use of sensors, the primary benefits are centered around safety and convenience. I predict strong consumer demand once driverless cars become commercially available.\n\nIn conclusion, the convergence of technological advancements, enhanced safety features, and increasing global acceptance points to the inevitable rise of driverless cars.  These factors combine to create a compelling case for their eventual widespread adoption.",

These vehicles represent a significant advancement over conventional cars, incorporating smart technology that makes them notably different from their traditional counterparts.\n\n## Advanced Safety Features\n\nDriverless cars come equipped with sophisticated safety features. A spinning laser sensor on the roof continuously updates a 3D model of the car's surroundings. A video camera mounted on the rearview mirror monitors the driver to ensure attention is maintained. Additionally, the vehicle includes four automotive sensors and a GPS receiver. These technological components work together to create a comprehensive safety system.\n\n## Current Capabilities and Limitations\n\nWhile these vehicles aren't completely autonomous, they can perform many functions independently, including:\n- Steering\n- Accelerating\n- Braking\n\nHowever, human intervention is still necessary in certain scenarios. For example, when approaching an accident scene, the driver must take control. In such situations, the car alerts the driver through seat vibrations, warning them of dangerous conditions that require human intervention.\n\n## Future Implementation\n\nCurrently, driverless cars aren't legally permitted everywhere, as manufacturers continue to refine the technology.",

        "Here's a polished version of the text with improved structure, flow, and clarity:\n\n**The Case Against Driverless Cars**\n\nDriverless cars, despite their promising technology, present several significant concerns that make them impractical and potentially dangerous. This technology, while innovative, falls short of its promised potential for several key reasons.\n\nFirst, the term \"driverless\" is misleading. These vehicles still require human intervention for many common situations, such as navigating driveways or managing complex traffic scenarios like construction zones or accidents. This partial automation creates a paradoxical situation: drivers must remain vigilant despite the car's autonomous capabilities. The very feature meant to reduce driver workload may actually increase the risk of accidents, as drivers might become complacent or distracted, failing to take control when necessary.\n\nLegal frameworks pose another significant challenge. Current traffic laws are fundamentally designed around human operators, with many states restricting or prohibiting the testing of autonomous vehicles. While manufacturers hope for legislative changes as the technology proves itself, crucial questions remain unresolved\u2014particularly regarding liability in accidents involving autonomous vehicles. Who bears responsibility: the manufacturer or the driver?\n\nThe technical complexity of these vehicles raises additional concerns. Consider Google's modified Toyota Prius, which relies on an extensive array of equipment:\n- A roof-mounted sensor system\n- A video camera near the rearview mirror\n- Four radar sensors\n- GPS receiver\n- Inertial motion sensor\n- Left rear wheel sensor\n\nThis complex network of sensors creates multiple potential points of failure. The safety of passengers and other road users depends entirely on the reliable operation of these sophisticated components, which may malfunction without warning.",
        "Here's the polished version of your text:\n\n**The Case Against Driverless Cars**\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles appear promising, offering potential safety benefits and cost savings, I argue they may not be the optimal solution for our transportation future. Driving is a significant responsibility, and in this analysis, I will explain why I believe autonomous vehicles should not be mass-produced. Instead of pursuing driverless technology, we should focus on improving existing vehicles while maintaining human control. Cost considerations also play a crucial role in this debate, as autonomous vehicles represent a substantial financial investment.\n\nMany drivers occasionally express frustration with driving, but most also acknowledge the pleasure they derive from operating a vehicle. Transitioning to driverless cars would eliminate this enjoyment. Furthermore, future generations would lose the valuable skill of manual driving. The high cost of autonomous vehicles could also create accessibility issues, potentially forcing more people to rely on walking or public transportation.\n\nSafety concerns arise from the possibility that passengers in autonomous vehicles may become overly complacent. Despite requirements for drivers to remain attentive, people might place excessive trust in the technology, leading to reduced road awareness and potentially more accidents than we currently experience.\n\nThe introduction of driverless cars could encourage dangerous behaviors, particularly among younger drivers. While features like anti-lock brakes enhance safety, they don't guarantee accident prevention. Teenagers, especially, might be more inclined to engage in distracting activities during travel. A more practical solution might be to upgrade existing vehicles with advanced safety features while maintaining human control.\n\nLegislative challenges must also be considered, including necessary modifications to speed limits and traffic management in urban areas. Questions remain about the environmental impact of autonomous vehicles compared to conventional cars.\n\nIn conclusion, while autonomous vehicles offer innovative features, safety concerns and the preservation of driving culture suggest we should proceed cautiously. Rather than pursuing fully autonomous vehicles, we should focus on enhancing current automobile technology. The joy of driving remains important to many people, and improving existing vehicles may provide a more balanced solution.\n\nBefore making definitive decisions about the future of autonomous vehicles, additional research and comprehensive testing are essential to fully understand their implications and effectiveness.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text that enhances logical flow and coherence:\n\n# The Unnecessary Risk of Driverless Cars\n\n## Introduction\nWhen you hear the words \"driverless car,\" what comes to mind? Perhaps you envision a vehicle that can transport anyone anywhere, even allowing young teens to travel without adult supervision. While the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" presents both positive and negative aspects of this technology, we must ask ourselves: \"Are driverless cars really a necessity?\" The evidence suggests they are not, for several compelling reasons.\n\n## The Myth of Full Automation\nDespite their name, driverless cars are not truly autonomous. These vehicles can steer, accelerate, and brake independently, but they still require an alert driver's presence. Human intervention remains necessary for navigating work zones and managing unexpected situations like accidents. While manufacturers continue developing alert systems to signal when human control is needed, these ongoing developments add to the already substantial costs.\n\n## The Entertainment System Paradox\nThe proposed integration of built-in entertainment systems presents another significant concern. Although modern vehicles already feature entertainment options for passengers, manufacturers want to install new systems in driverless cars that would deactivate when driver attention is required. This creates an inherent contradiction: drivers must remain alert while simultaneously being encouraged to engage with entertainment features. This is fundamentally no different from the distraction of mobile phones, which these systems explicitly prohibit.\n\n## The Liability Dilemma\nPerhaps the most troubling aspect is the question of liability in case of accidents or system failures. Who bears responsibility when something goes wrong? The driver could be blamed for not maintaining proper attention and preventing the accident. Conversely, the manufacturer could be held accountable for system failures they were responsible for preventing. This ambiguity in accountability creates significant legal and ethical challenges.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile driverless car technology continues to advance, it introduces more complications than solutions.",

While humans naturally interpret facial expressions\u2014smiles indicating happiness, frowns suggesting sadness, raised eyebrows showing surprise\u2014computers can now analyze these cues with even greater precision. This technological advancement offers promising applications in educational settings, where understanding student reactions is crucial for effective teaching.\n\nThe technology works by creating a sophisticated 3-D computer model of the face, incorporating all 44 major facial muscles that mirror human expressions. This system can accurately identify six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Such precision in emotional recognition provides teachers with valuable insights into student engagement that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nStudent engagement remains a persistent challenge in education, with many learners struggling to maintain interest in traditional classroom activities. They often seek learning experiences that are both educational and engaging. This is where emotion-recognition technology becomes particularly valuable\u2014it allows teachers to receive real-time feedback about student reactions to different teaching methods and materials. As noted in the research, teachers can then adjust their teaching approaches while maintaining the core curriculum content.",
        "This passage argues against visiting and studying Venus, critiquing the original author's omission of crucial considerations. While the author effectively presents Venus's similarity to Earth, they fail to address the significant challenges and costs associated with such a venture.\n\nA major flaw in the original argument is the lack of discussion regarding the astronomical costs of a Venus mission.  The author glosses over this, likely because the expense of overcoming the immense obstacles\u2014an average surface temperature exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure 90 times that of Earth\u2014far outweighs any perceived need for another planet.  These challenges would require significant financial investment to mitigate, a point not adequately explored.\n\nFurthermore, the author never establishes a compelling reason for comparing Venus to Earth.  While mentioning Venus as Earth's twin and suggesting the possibility of past life, they fail to articulate why this should be a primary concern. The text highlights the unsuccessful history of Venus exploration, noting that no spacecraft has survived on the surface for more than a few hours. This raises the question: why persist with a mission that appears so improbable?",
        "Are driverless cars a good idea? I believe they are not, due to safety concerns, cost, and legal hurdles.\n\nFirst, safety remains a significant concern.  The article raises the critical question of liability: \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault\u2014the driver or the manufacturer?\"  It also mentions that driverless cars use light signals to indicate traffic jams and other safety issues. However, what happens if a human driver is distracted and doesn't react to these signals in time?  What if the signals malfunction?  Furthermore, potential issues like malfunctioning anti-lock brakes add to these concerns.  There are simply too many potential points of failure to guarantee safety on the road.\n\nSecond, the cost of implementing driverless car technology is prohibitive.  The article points out that these vehicles often require \"smart roads\" with extensive infrastructure upgrades: \"These smart roads systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\"  This cost would inevitably be passed on to consumers, making these supposedly \"eco-saving\" cars unaffordable for many. The article continues, \"Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars...\"  Even shifting the technological burden to the vehicles themselves results in significantly higher manufacturing costs, ultimately driving up the price for consumers.  The expense of these \"smart\" cars outweighs any potential benefits.\n\nThird, legal restrictions hinder the widespread adoption of driverless cars. Some states require \"a human driver in control at all times.\" This demonstrates a lack of trust in fully autonomous vehicles, even if the technology were perfected.  The article notes that other \"states will follow as soon as the cars are proven reliably safe.\"  This cautious approach underscores the prevailing skepticism about the safety and reliability of driverless technology.",
        "The first image that made the natural landform on Mars look like a face had low resolution compared to the subsequent images. The original Viking image had very low resolution compared to the ones taken in 1998 and 2001. Michel Malin and his MOC team took photos that were ten times clearer than the original Viking photos.\n\nThe later images taken after the original Viking image were clear enough and enlarged enough to see any type of building or structure, but none were seen. There were 1.56 meters per pixel in the original image, but in the 2001 image, there was 43 meters per pixel. Some conspiracy theorists thought that NASA hid some alien markings, but NASA did not hide anything. It is clear in the photos taken after the original Viking photo.\n\nIf there were some sort of life form on Mars, NASA would get more funding. They were getting everyone's attention and making everyone wonder if there was some sort of alien life form on Mars that could have created the \"face.\" They would have received a significant amount of money to investigate what was on Mars.\n\nIf there were any structures built on Mars, they would be visible due to the size and resolution of the images. There is no reason for NASA to lie about there being no alien life form on Mars.

NASA would be happy if there were some life form to create the face on Mars, as they would receive more funding.",
        "I believe that driverless cars should not be developed. While they may appear promising initially, the drawbacks of owning one of these vehicles are substantial. To start with, they would be exorbitantly expensive to manufacture and purchase, with the delicate sensors they rely on being prone to damage or malfunction. Moreover, the potential for these vehicles to be vulnerable to hacking, leading to malicious tampering that could result in accidents, is concerning. The possibility of a malfunction causing harm to a driver, passenger, or pedestrian further underscores the significant risks associated with these vehicles.\n\nEven if these vehicles were to become more widely available, they would likely face continuous scrutiny and criticism, with people inevitably discovering flaws or finding ways to circumvent the safety features. For instance, pressure sensors could be implemented to ensure the car only operates when the driver's hands are on the steering wheel, but individuals could easily bypass this by, for example, wrapping the wheel with tape, potentially causing accidents. These factors, among others, lead me to the conclusion that the production and sale of driverless cars should be avoided.",

        "Today, I will be discussing the \"Face on Mars.\" Some individuals claim that there are aliens residing on Mars who created the face structure. However, as a member of NASA, I have valid arguments against this notion.\n\nFirstly, the face on Mars bears a resemblance to a human face, which raises doubts about alien involvement, considering that aliens have never interacted with humans to know our appearance. Additionally, if NASA were to propose the existence of alien life, it could significantly benefit financially, which adds a layer of skepticism to such claims.\n\nTherefore, I firmly believe that the theory of alien life on Mars lacks substantial evidence. Despite my efforts, there are still individuals who persist in their belief in aliens, despite the lack of conclusive proof. In reality, the existence of aliens on Mars is highly unlikely, and I stand by this assertion. Thank you, and I am available to provide further information, if necessary.",
        "Let me help restructure this text to improve its flow, clarity, and professionalism:\n\n```markdown\nThe Facial Action Coding System (FACS), developed by Prof. Dr. Huang and his colleagues, represents a groundbreaking advancement in human-computer interaction. This innovative software can analyze and interpret human emotions by constructing a detailed 3D model of facial muscles, monitoring all 44 major muscle groups to detect subtle emotional changes.\n\nThe technology's potential applications span various industries, but its implementation in educational settings appears particularly promising. In classrooms, FACS could revolutionize how teachers understand and respond to their students' emotional states. By detecting when students become confused or disengaged, educators can adjust their teaching methods in real-time for more effective learning outcomes.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n**Can Computers Read Our Emotions? The Promise of Facial Action Coding Systems**\n\nHave you ever felt bored in class but tried to hide it from your teacher? Thanks to advancing technology, computers equipped with Facial Action Coding Systems can now identify human emotions. Scientists and researchers are developing systems that detect emotions by analyzing facial muscle movements, much like how we naturally read expressions on a friend's face.\n\nImagine a system that interprets your emotional state through facial expressions by monitoring subtle muscle movements. We already do this instinctively when reading friends' expressions, but computers could do it with greater precision. According to Dr. Huang, this technology could revolutionize how we interact with content. If a computer detects boredom, it could adjust the lesson or skip similar content in the future. Conversely, if you show enthusiasm, it could offer more related material.\n\nWhat's particularly fascinating is that most human communication is nonverbal, making this technology especially relevant. The Facial Action Coding System works by creating a detailed 3D model of each person's face, analyzing the 44 major facial muscles. The system aims to recognize six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It accomplishes this by tracking characteristic muscle movements\u2014for instance, raised eyebrows indicating surprise or tightened lips suggesting anger.\n\nThe technology's potential accuracy is impressive. In one notable demonstration, it analyzed the Mona Lisa's expression, determining she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. While the system may not be perfect initially, its accuracy will likely improve over time. Consider how human psychologists can already interpret emotions from subtle facial cues\u2014their expertise could help refine these systems further.\n\nLooking ahead, while fully functional emotion-reading machines aren't yet commonplace, the technology shows promising potential. It could transform our interaction with devices, making them more responsive to our emotional states. This development marks the beginning of a new era where technology better understands and responds to human emotions, potentially revolutionizing everything from education to entertainment.",
        "Is Venus safe, or merely survivable, for human life? This is the central question scientists are grappling with.  What other approaches are they considering for Venus exploration? What makes Venus so valuable that scientists would risk their lives to study it? These are the questions NASA is pondering as it contemplates missions to Venus.\n\nVenus, the planet closest to the Sun after Mercury, presents a harsh atmospheric environment, but one potentially bearable for humans.  As the text explains, NASA's proposed solution to the hostile surface conditions involves having scientists float above the intense heat and pressure.  At over thirty miles above the surface, temperatures would still be hot, around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be similar to Earth's at sea level.  Furthermore, solar power would be abundant, and radiation levels would be comparable to Earth's.  While challenging, these conditions are potentially survivable.  A vehicle, unlike a human, can hover above Venus, effectively avoiding the hazardous surface conditions.  This explains why Venus, though not safe, might be survivable for humans.\n\nScientists are drawn to Venus because of its potential for past life and its geological features. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.  Long ago, Venus was likely covered largely by oceans and may have supported various life forms, much like Earth.  The planet's surface consists of rocky sediment and includes familiar features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This potential for discovery explains why scientists consider Venus worth the risk of human exploration.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# Understanding Student Emotions Through FACS\n\nAs a teacher standing before your students, have you ever wondered what thoughts and emotions lie behind their expressions? The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) offers a fascinating solution to this age-old question.\n\nFACS enables educators to understand their students' emotional responses to various classroom activities, from traditional projects to computer-based assignments. By scanning facial expressions, this sophisticated system can decode students' genuine feelings about their learning experience.\n\nDeveloped by Dr. Paul Ekman, FACS can analyze facial expressions not only in real-time but also from photographs. The system focuses on six basic emotions:\n- Happiness\n- Surprise\n- Anger\n- Disgust\n- Fear\n- Sadness",
        "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" discusses the arrival of a new invention: driverless cars. As indicated by the title, the article outlines both the advantages and disadvantages of this innovation. The author provides insights into how these cars function and highlights some features that might be included in them.\n\nOne of the first aspects covered is how these vehicles operate. The article explains that driverless cars are expected to consume only half the fuel used by current vehicles. Google has already developed a prototype that hasn't experienced any crashes yet. These cars are designed to run on tracks equipped with electrical cables that transmit radio signals to receivers at the car's front end.\n\nAdditionally, the article delves into potential features these vehicles might possess. For example, they can manage functions up to twenty-five miles per hour but employ special touch sensors to ensure drivers keep their hands on the wheel. While not all models are entirely autonomous, they can steer, accelerate, and brake autonomously but notify drivers when human intervention is required. Moreover, driver's seats may vibrate if there's a risk of backing into an object, and cameras could monitor drivers to ensure they remain attentive.\n\nDespite these innovations, I personally believe such cars should not be made available for public use just yet. While there is an argument for improved safety for both drivers and those around them, I have reservations about some features like surveillance cameras monitoring drivers' attentiveness; this seems invasive rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, one positive aspect is reduced fuel consumption which correlates with decreased pollution\u2014a definite advantage in my view.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System, which interprets the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is a valuable tool. As the author states, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\" (Making Mona Lisa Smile).\n\nThis innovative system is also adept at detecting one's emotions. The author mentions, \"In a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful\" (Making Mona Lisa Smile).\n\nThis is crucial because the technology can significantly enhance children's education. Often, students hesitate to ask their teachers for help due to embarrassment. However, with this new system, students will feel less afraid or embarrassed, as the Facial Action Coding System can identify when a student is confused or bored, and provide the necessary assistance without the student needing to ask a teacher.\n\nAdditionally, the system can help teachers understand the students' feelings towards a subject and monitor their progress. It streamlines the process, saving teachers a considerable amount of time, as they won't need to rely solely on questions or tests to gauge a student's understanding of the lesson.\n\nThis development is important, as, from a personal perspective, the system could make a significant difference.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# The Questionable Future of Driverless Cars\n\nCan you imagine a life where humans no longer control their vehicles? While it might sound appealing, this reality is closer than you might think. According to the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" Tesla projected a 2016 release for a car capable of operating on autopilot 90 percent of the time, while Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan planned to introduce self-driving vehicles by 2020. Since the automobile's invention, humans have been in control of their vehicles. The concept of driverless cars represents a dramatic shift from this traditional manual control, and I believe this technological leap is neither logical nor necessary.\n\nConsider the complexity of modern vehicles and their numerous components that could malfunction. Driverless cars incorporate even more sophisticated technology than conventional vehicles, introducing additional points of potential failure. When problems arise, diagnosing and repairing these advanced systems would prove challenging for most people, as automotive technology continues to evolve rapidly, and many individuals still struggle with basic technological concepts.\n\nMoreover, do we truly need driverless cars in our lives? This innovation might only encourage greater societal laziness. People could become overly dependent on autonomous vehicles, potentially losing their ability to drive conventionally. Modern society seems fixated on finding ways to make life easier, but this particular advancement might ultimately complicate our lives more than we anticipate. As noted in the article, \"Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?\" This technology threatens to strip away the enjoyment and engagement of driving.\n\nThe financial implications also raise concerns. Driverless vehicles would likely remain out of reach for many consumers who struggle to afford even older model cars. This disparity raises important questions: How would this affect those unable to purchase autonomous vehicles? Would conventional cars create complications in an environment dominated by self-driving vehicles?\n\nIn conclusion, the rush to develop driverless cars appears premature and unnecessary.",
        "The use of technology to read students' expressions in the classroom is valuable as it greatly aids all students in quickly finding information they need. Technology makes the process easier and more efficient.\n\nAs the article mentioned, \"Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.\" Technology enables us to determine the percentage of happiness, disgust, fear, and anger in an image. For example, \"She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.\"\n\nTechnology has become increasingly important and useful for people worldwide, providing access to vast amounts of information, making work easier, and more efficient. According to the article, \"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts.\"\n\nFurthermore, technology can also help people relax after a long, stressful day, whether at work, school, or elsewhere, by engaging in activities like playing games, watching movies, or listening to music, all of which aid in relaxation.",
        "Venus is Earth's Twin because have almost the same density and size, and occasionally the closest distance. The author speaks about Venus, how if he went there, he would give you a lot of information about the planet, like, the fact that people sometimes call it the \"Evening Star\" and explains why people give it this nickname. Venus is really close to our planet, and scientists should examine it better. Maybe the author thinks that there can be life on Venus.\n\nVenus was a planet almost like Earth, covered with oceans and various forms of life. Today, it still has similarities to Earth, so scientists should verify this planet better. Maybe it could be our next planet to live on. The possibilities of this happening are not very high, but if scientists or NASA find a planet identical to Venus, it would be a big step for humanity.\n\nVenus, a planet not really safe, has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, temperatures that can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that of Earth. No humans could survive in these conditions. Just imagine how much information you can gain by reading about \"the challenge of exploring Venus.\" It can teach you a lot of things that you may not have known before.",
        "The integration of the 'Facial Action Coding System' into educational settings, particularly online learning environments, holds significant potential to enhance student engagement and comprehension. In a traditional classroom, if a student becomes confused, they can raise their hand and ask a question, and a teacher may even notice their confusion through their facial expressions. However, online learning is often an independent task, lacking the immediate, personalized feedback available in a classroom. \n\nThis technology can benefit not only the students but also the educational platforms, such as websites or apps, they are using. For instance, if a student is reading an article, the system can help the website owner or app designer assess whether the article is engaging and appropriate for the student's grade level. The Facial Action Coding System can also be applied in educational settings for younger children, such as those using ABCmouse.com, by providing feedback on the child's emotions, which can, in turn, be communicated to the parents, enhancing the learning experience for all ages.",
        "I have mixed feelings about driverless cars for various reasons, despite their positive impacts. Could these cars represent the next evolutionary step in the manufacturing industry, or do they pose hazards?\n\nDriverless cars appear to be a futuristic and fascinating concept that could become a reality. Let's discuss some of the benefits of these cars. They are highly efficient, reducing fuel wastage and saving energy, as mentioned in the first paragraph. Equipped with sensors, driverless cars are always alert to their surroundings, capable of stopping the vehicle, alerting the passengers of any dangers, and more. Google's driverless cars have traveled over half a million miles without a single crash, a feat that, in my opinion, a human-driven car might not have achieved. However, despite these advantages, these cars are not entirely autonomous.\n\nFor the most part, these cars are not fully independent, as they still require a driver to be present, ready to intervene when needed, such as in a traffic jam or a car crash. I find it concerning that the passenger, who is expected to be fully aware of the vehicle and its surroundings, may become distracted, potentially falling asleep, using their phone, and so forth, thereby, creating a safety issue.",
        "The future is advancing rapidly.\n\nDriverless cars are no longer just concepts; they are currently being manufactured and tested.\n\nWhile driverless cars have both positive and negative aspects, I believe they are not yet beneficial for society.\n\nFor cars to be autonomous, they must react promptly to any situation at any time and have faster response times than humans.\n\nIf a car possesses all these capabilities, it ceases to be just a car and becomes a robotic machine capable of making life-or-death decisions for its passengers and pedestrians.\n\nHowever, at present, cars are not fully autonomous.\n\nWe have yet to develop the technology to create cars with the essential human qualities, such as natural reflexes to avoid obstacles.\n\nThe world we inhabit today is different from yesterday and will be different tomorrow.\n\nOur current technology is progressing rapidly.\n\nToday, it's smart cars, tomorrow, smart houses, and the day after, smart individuals.\n\nWhile technology is beneficial, humans are so focused on constant improvement that they overlook the current advantages.\n\nWhat will happen to the human race if we rely solely on technology and not on each other?\n\nIf driverless cars become the primary mode of transportation for short distances, humans may neglect to develop hand-eye coordination and reflexes.\n\nThis could lead to a decline in these essential motor functions.\n\nWith the rapid advancement of technology, humans are gradually regressing.\n\nThe introduction of smartphones and tablets has resulted in humans having shorter attention spans than previous generations.\n\nPersonally, I oppose driverless cars, as they will push society further into a technology-driven existence.\n\nBy relying on these advanced cars, we are entrusting our lives to technology, and this trend is likely to continue.\n\nThe future is introducing a myriad of new devices and gadgets to simplify and ease our lives, but who wants a mundane, technology-dependent existence, where everything is handed to us on a silver platter?",

Such a discovery would fundamentally change our understanding of life in the universe, ending humanity's perceived cosmic solitude. While recent technological advances have enhanced our ability to search for extraterrestrial life, we must approach this possibility with caution.\n\nRecent NASA developments have improved our capacity to detect potential signs of life, but this capability should give us pause.

        "Think about a time when you felt extremely tired, barely able to keep your eyes open, and everything you heard seemed like a blur because you were simply zoned out. For me, that time was sitting in my English class, learning about Shakespeare. It felt like time would never end in that class. All around me, students had the same exhausted expressions. Facial expressions are a crucial aspect of communication. When you're out in public, you see many faces, and you can easily gauge their emotions and feelings. In today's society, technology plays a significant role, and we can now use it to determine someone's emotions. I believe that using technology to read emotional expressions in students could bring valuable insights to classrooms.  \n\nStudents in schools have a variety of emotions and experiences, and these emotions can fluctuate rapidly. Sometimes, these emotions make it challenging for students to concentrate during class, especially when teachers introduce new lessons. In the article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" writer Nick D'Alto discusses a new software, the Facial Action Coding System, designed to accurately determine people's emotions. Implementing this software in schools could be advantageous, shaping a better educational environment. The software can help teachers understand the emotions students are experiencing during a lecture. D'Alto quotes Dr. Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, who predicts, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\"",
        "The face-like appearance of this landform in early photographs might be explained by several factors, all pointing to a natural origin.  First, the limited resolution of cameras at the time, with pixels as large as 43 meters (compared to 1.56 meters today), could easily distort shapes and create illusions. This low resolution, combined with the angle of the camera and the direction of the light source, could significantly alter the appearance of shadows, potentially creating the impression of a human head.  Weather conditions at the time of the photograph, such as cloud cover, could also contribute to this effect.\n\nFurthermore, the angle of the sunlight and the resulting shadows play a crucial role in how we perceive shapes.  The interplay of light and shadow could easily create an illusion, making a naturally occurring landform resemble a human face.\n\nWhile some might interpret the image as something artificial, these technical limitations and natural factors provide strong evidence for a natural landform.",
        "Reading someone's facial expression may sometimes be effective, but it doesn't necessarily reflect their true emotions. For example, a person might appear angry or confused but could actually be feeling extremely happy. In an article, the author mentioned that Dr. Huang used a picture of the Mona Lisa to test new emotion-recognition software. However, the effectiveness of the software is questionable, as it was tested on a painted image rather than a real, living person. Additionally, da Vinci may have exaggerated the Mona Lisa's facial expression for artistic purposes, making it an unreliable test subject.\n\nUsing this software in a classroom setting may not be effective. If a student makes a certain face, it doesn't necessarily mean they are bored or confused; it could just be their natural expression. The software could misinterpret their facial cues, or it might even glitch. Moreover, using the software would require a camera, which raises safety concerns. Hackers could potentially access the computer, stealing personal information or, worse, the student's identity.\n\nIn conclusion, this software is not valuable for classroom use, as students have other, more pressing needs than a facial coding system. The presence of a camera, if known, could be a distraction, making the software unnecessary.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text, focusing on logical flow and clear argumentation:\n\n**The Natural Origins of Mars' Famous \"Face\"**\n\nThe so-called \"Face\" on Mars has sparked considerable debate about its origins, but evidence strongly suggests it was formed by natural processes rather than alien civilization. While some believe this formation was created by extraterrestrial beings, scientific investigation reveals a much simpler explanation.\n\nScientists who investigated the site have conclusively determined that the Face is a natural landform. Using advanced imaging technology, they were able to examine the formation in detail, even when skeptics claimed that seasonal haze might be concealing alien markings. These high-resolution photographs revealed the true nature of the structure.\n\nThe formation bears striking similarities to geological features found on Earth, particularly in the American West. As researcher Jim Garvin noted, \"This landform reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" He explained that the Idaho formation is a lava dome taking the form of an isolated mesa, approximately the same height as the Martian Face. This geological parallel provides compelling evidence for natural formation.\n\nWeather and erosion likely played crucial roles in shaping this feature over time. Throughout Earth's history, numerous landforms have been created by similar natural processes, and Mars is no exception. The Face appears to be equivalent to a butte or mesa, common geological formations that result from erosion and environmental forces.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves its logical flow and coherence:\n\n\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\"\n\n**Introduction**\nThe author argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its inherent dangers, supporting this claim through a systematic presentation of challenges and their corresponding solutions.\n\n**Main Challenges and Solutions**\nThe primary obstacles to Venus exploration are established in paragraph three, where the author details the planet's extreme heat and crushing atmospheric pressure\u2014conditions lethal to human life. Building on this foundation, paragraph five presents NASA's innovative solution: a \"blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian surface,\" designed to mitigate both the temperature and pressure challenges.\n\n**Secondary Challenges and Technological Solutions**\nWhile acknowledging that observing Venus from a safe distance \"can provide only limited insight on ground conditions,\" the author doesn't leave this challenge unaddressed. The subsequent paragraph describes NASA's development of technology capable of withstanding Venus's harsh environment while conducting necessary measurements, demonstrating another problem-solution pair that strengthens the author's argument.\n\n**Structural Analysis**\nThe author employs a consistent pattern throughout the text:\n1. Identify a specific challenge\n2. Present a corresponding technological or methodological solution\n3. Demonstrate how the solution supports the feasibility of Venus exploration\n\n**Conclusion**\nThrough this methodical approach of presenting problems and their solutions, the author effectively supports the central thesis that Venus exploration, while dangerous, is both worthwhile and achievable. The systematic presentation of challenges followed by practical solutions creates a compelling argument for continued Venus exploration efforts.\n\nThis restructuring organizes the content thematically, making the author's argument progression clearer and more impactful.",
        "Luke is a boy who signed up with his friend Don to become a seagoing cowboy. Here's why you should consider signing up, just like Luke did. \n\nFirst and foremost, being a seagoing cowboy allows you to help people around the world while traveling. For example, Luke went to Europe to assist with restocking supplies, food, and animals, making a meaningful impact on the communities he visited. Not only does this give you a sense of accomplishment, but it also allows you to experience a different way of life and lend a helping hand to those in need. \n\nAnother reason to consider this adventure is the opportunity to interact with some fascinating animals. While shipping animals across the seas, you\u2019ll have the chance to spend time with them, making the work a unique and rewarding experience. Furthermore, you can enjoy a bit of sightseeing, both on the ship and on the lands you visit. For instance, Luke made the most of his trip to Europe, taking the opportunity to explore the sights, like the ruins, structures, and the rich, historic landscapes, which, in his words, made the hard work, \"an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.\"\n\nThe journey, while challenging, also offers the chance to bond, relax, and have some fun, especially after the animals, the primary cargo, are unloaded.",
        "It's Not an Alien\n\nIn my opinion, this is not a face created by aliens because I don't believe aliens exist. There is no evidence supporting the reality of aliens. While scientists have discovered unusual phenomena and sometimes attribute them to aliens, there is no concrete proof of their existence.\n\nThe reason I believe this is not a face is because of information presented in \"Unmasking the Face of Mars.\" The article states, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" It further mentions that when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured an image ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers awaited the image, which, when it appeared on a JPL website, revealed a natural landform, not an alien monument. Another image, taken on April 8, 2001, using the camera's maximum resolution, further confirmed this. Garvin noted, \"You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects as large as airplanes on the ground, you would be able to see them.\"",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n**The Evolution of Autonomous Vehicles: A Path to Safer Roads**\n\nThe role of autonomous vehicles has grown significantly, becoming increasingly accessible to both the public and companies. While there are both advantages and disadvantages to these technological developments, I believe their impact will ultimately benefit society.\n\nCurrently, one of the main limitations of autonomous vehicles is their incomplete automation. Most self-driving cars only operate autonomously in specific conditions, requiring drivers to remain vigilant and prepared to take control. This raises a valid question: What's the advantage of a \"driverless\" car if constant alertness is still necessary? However, this limitation is temporary. With continued research and development, we will likely achieve fully autonomous vehicles that can operate independently without requiring constant driver supervision.\n\nHuman error is a significant factor in traffic accidents, often resulting in injury or death. By eliminating this variable through perfected autonomous technology, we could dramatically reduce car crashes and related injuries. Autonomous vehicles utilize sophisticated sensor systems that enable them to make split-second decisions and apply brakes precisely when needed, potentially preventing accidents that human drivers might not avoid.\n\nThe technology behind autonomous vehicles continues to advance.",
        "The idea of aliens creating a face on Mars is a popular one, but the evidence points to a more natural explanation.  People often perceive familiar shapes in random objects or landforms, a phenomenon seen frequently on Earth.  So, the question becomes: what created the \u201cFace on Mars\u201d? Nature or aliens?\n\nThe Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission provides crucial evidence.  Arriving at Mars in September 1997, eighteen years after the Viking mission, MGS prioritized photographing the Cydonia region, home to the alleged \"Face.\"  While some initially speculated about alien involvement, few scientists took the idea seriously.\n\nMichael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team further debunked the alien theory.  They captured images ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.  These images, eagerly awaited by thousands online, revealed the \"Face\" to be a natural landform, dispelling the notion of an alien monument. This significantly weakens the argument for any substantial alien creations on Mars, past or present.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence strongly suggests that the \"Face\" is simply a natural geological formation.  The improved image quality from later missions demonstrates how differences in photographic resolution, coupled with potential changes to the landform over time, can lead to misinterpretations.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\" has captivated the public imagination since NASA first unveiled an image that appeared to show a human-like face on the Martian surface.  This image fueled speculation about alien civilizations and even starred in movies, talk shows, and magazines. Many people strongly believed it was an alien monument. Others argued it was merely a natural landform, unintentionally appearing facial.\n\nAs a scientist, I subscribe to the latter explanation.  The initial image, taken by the Viking spacecraft, lacked the resolution to definitively determine the nature of the formation. However, on April 5th, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor, equipped with the higher-resolution Mars Orbiter Camera, flew over the Cydonia region where the \"face\" is located.  Michael Malin and his team captured an image ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.  Thousands of people anxiously awaited the release of this image on a JPL website.",
        "I disagree with the concept of driverless cars.  Primarily, I believe they are inherently dangerous. The requirement for a driver to remain alert negates the very purpose of autonomous driving.  Alerts designed to recapture the driver's attention shouldn't be necessary. If a car is truly driverless, it should function without any human intervention.\n\nWhile I understand the appeal for long road trips, where one person typically bears the burden of driving, and the desire for drivers to rest, the safety implications are concerning.  Even if a sleeping driver is alerted to an impending accident, their reaction time and judgment could be severely impaired.  Expecting someone roused from sleep to instantly take control in a critical situation is unrealistic.  They might panic and exacerbate the situation, leading to further collisions. The potential for catastrophic failures with driverless technology is simply too high.\n\nWhile many anticipate the widespread adoption of such technology, I'm reminded of the dystopian future portrayed in the movie Wall-E, where people became obese and indolent due to reliance on automated systems.  Do we really want to follow that trajectory?  The United States already struggles with obesity, and eliminating the need to drive will further reduce opportunities for even minimal physical activity.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe driverless cars are a misguided innovation.",

        "In this article, the example they use to show how it could be efficient in schools is '\"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" and then goes on to say how the software could change the lesson for them, or give some help. What would an average student (saying this software isnt yet in classrooms) do in the same situation? Raise their hand, ask for help from a teacher, and get personal help just the same way the technology would solve the problem. To be fair though, not all students have an available teacher, or some work at home; what could those students do? Contact someone else (like a teacher for example in online school), figure it out, and eventually understand the problem all the same. With this technology of course, the idea is that the student doesn't have to put in any effort of asking for help and could identify the eventual solution by just showing emotion. Worded differently, this entire example of how classroom computers are beneficial could become a statement of flaws in this idea.\n\nFirstly, the software could most likely be easily tricked. For evidence of students easily being able to get help & manipulate lessons by emotions; students could also manipulate lessons purposefully using software features to easily get ahead in problems or simply not put much effort into understanding them. The point about ease because of software with confused students is valid but what about lessons that communicating teaches them? The future aspects of life aren't going to be solely technology-based; so what happens when people rely too much on getting their emotions read easily and start communicating less with actual people? Not everyone can interpret others' troubles just by appearance alone. What would someone think when they are trying to convey a certain feeling and no one notices (because it's definitely not easy for normal people)?

Earth, Venus, and Mars orbit the Sun at different speeds, creating a celestial dance where our proximity to each planet varies over time.\n\nGiven Venus's relative closeness\u2014at least in astronomical terms\u2014humanity has launched numerous spacecraft to explore this cloud-shrouded world. However, despite its proximity, Venus presents formidable challenges for human exploration.\n\nWhat makes Venus so fascinating to astronomers is that it may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Today, though, it presents a hostile environment: a thick atmosphere composed of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide envelops the planet, while clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid drift through its skies. Surface conditions are extreme, with temperatures averaging over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's.\n\nRemarkably, Venus maintains the highest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, surpassing even Mercury, despite being farther from the Sun.\n\nScientists believe that Venus once hosted vast oceans and possibly supported various forms of life, similar to Earth. These challenging conditions, rather than deterrents, have become catalysts for innovation. Researchers are developing new technologies to advance our understanding of Venus.\n\nWhile modern electronic computers might struggle in Venus's harsh environment, mechanical computing systems\u2014using gears and levers\u2014could prove more resilient to extreme pressure, heat, and other forces. These robust mechanical systems might offer solutions for exploring Venus's hostile terrain.",

        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents an optimistic view on the potential for humans to someday touch down and explore the surface of Venus. The article, structured in a professional manner, balances the pros and cons associated with this ambitious endeavor. It acknowledges the significant risks humans would face due to Venus's harsh conditions, which currently prevent us from exploring its surface directly. However, these concerns are offset by discussing new technological innovations and alternative methods for getting closer to Venus.\n\nIn one of the initial paragraphs, the author creates an illusion that Venus is almost within our reach by describing it as \"...right around the corner...\" He highlights that \"...Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally in distance too.\" These statements suggest that despite its proximity making it seemingly accessible for exploration, there are substantial challenges yet to be overcome.\n\nSubsequently, he delves into paragraph three with an explanation of these dangers\u2014elucidating why human exploration hasn't advanced further on what might appear as a \"simple\" planet. The narrative then transitions into a more optimistic tone as past comparisons between Earth and Venus provide insights; astronomers have long held interest because \"it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" This draws readers into contemplating Earth's similarities with Venus\u2014enhancing their engagement through familiarity.",
        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author discusses both the positive and negative aspects of driverless cars, ultimately concluding that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. The development of these vehicles could significantly aid society. They have features such as notifying drivers when human intervention is necessary, using sensors and computer technology to enhance safety, and vibrating seats to warn drivers when they're about to back into an object. These innovations promise safer driving experiences for all.\n\nThe integration of sensors, along with advanced hardware and software, alerts drivers when their involvement is essential for navigating \"through work zones and around accidents.\" The vibrating seat feature is particularly useful in preventing accidents by alerting drivers before they back into obstacles. Additionally, these cars are capable of steering, accelerating, and braking autonomously but are still designed to signal when human intervention is required for certain tasks only a driver can perform. Information from sensors enables cars to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce engine power for superior response and control compared to what a driver can achieve alone. These capabilities greatly enhance overall safety.\n\nDeveloping driverless cars will make driving considerably safer. Although these vehicles can perform many tasks traditionally handled by humans, they still require a driver's presence. One might wonder why driverless cars need drivers at all; the answer lies in their necessity for managing situations like crashes or navigating work zones effectively.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the essay about driverless cars:\n\n```markdown\nWhat Will Life Be Like with Driverless Cars?\n\nDriverless cars represent an exciting advancement in transportation technology, offering several compelling benefits: smart-road integration, enhanced safety features, and convenient autonomous operation.\n\nSmart roads will play a crucial role in the driverless car revolution. As many futurists have noted, the key to developing self-driving cars lies not just in creating smarter vehicles, but in developing intelligent road systems. These smart roads will help regulate vehicle speed and assist with navigation, reducing the likelihood of human error.\n\nSafety stands as another significant advantage of driverless vehicles. Manufacturers have already implemented advanced technologies, such as wheel-mounted speed sensors for antilock braking systems. These features enable faster stopping times and provide assistance to those with limited mobility.",
        "Can cars truly be driverless? This article delves into the science behind the development of driverless cars. While these vehicles have their pros and cons, the technology is becoming increasingly advanced and well-understood over time.\n\nDriverless cars offer significant advantages. In the 1950s, General Motors introduced what they called a concept car, which operated only on a specialized test track embedded with electrical cables that transmitted radio signals to the vehicle. Modern advancements include LIDAR technology, which constantly updates a 3-D model of the car's surroundings. This combination enables driverless cars to mimic human driving skills. Manufacturers are also considering installing cameras inside vehicles to ensure that drivers remain aware of road conditions.\n\nHowever, there are still challenges associated with driverless cars. Although these vehicles can navigate freeways hands-free and park autonomously, drivers must remain engaged in case they need to take control. A common concern is whether drivers might become bored while waiting for their turn to drive. Even when not actively steering, drivers must stay alert in case intervention is required; for example, if a work zone appears on the freeway, an alert will notify them to take control.\n\nDriverless cars are progressing toward becoming more autonomous innovations. While they cannot yet drive entirely independently, some models\u2014like those produced by Tesla\u2014can operate autonomously about 90% of the time. Although not yet at peak performance levels, this represents a significant achievement in automotive technology as it minimizes the necessity for manual driving.\n\nThe journey toward creating fully autonomous vehicles has come far\u2014from conceptual models used solely on test tracks to functional prototypes on public roads today.",
        "I am completely against driverless cars, mainly because I believe that computers are attempting to dominate our world. They are taking away jobs from people every day, which is truly disheartening. And now, they are trying to strip away our ability to drive, one of the few things we still have control over.\n\nThis situation strikes me as rather amusing, if it even matters. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that this is not the ideal solution. Eventually, accidents will occur, tarnishing the reputation of these cars, especially if they become widespread. What I find frustrating is the need to remain vigilant while using them. If we still need to stay alert, why not just drive a traditional car yourself? It seems nonsensical to have to stay attentive to drive a driverless car, making it, in my view, a lazy alternative. As for the issue of gas, while these cars may use half the amount, if the government were more efficient, we could earn decent wages, and gas prices could be reasonable, benefiting everyone.

        "Here's the polished version:\n\nThe author presents a refreshingly optimistic perspective on studying Venus, diverging from conventional viewpoints. Rather than dwelling on the impossibilities\u2014particularly the fact that humans cannot physically set foot on the planet\u2014he sees these challenges as opportunities for innovation. He argues that humanity shouldn't abandon its Venusian aspirations simply because they seem daunting or dangerous. Instead, he views these obstacles as motivation, believing that transformative discoveries often emerge from what others dismiss as impossible dreams.\n\nNASA continues to pursue Venus research with practical alternatives. While direct human exploration remains unfeasible, they're developing plans to conduct research from floating stations above the planet's surface. Although observations from this vantage point may not provide the same detailed data as surface exploration, it represents the best current compromise. Looking ahead, NASA aims to develop technology capable of withstanding Venus's extreme pressure and heat. Scientists believe that Venus once closely resembled Earth, featuring similar topographical elements like valleys, mountains, and craters. Often called Earth's twin, Venus potentially hosted large bodies of water and may have been capable of supporting life in its distant past. These intriguing similarities drive researchers' continued interest in the planet.\n\nThe future of Venus exploration appears promising, particularly in the realm of robotic exploration. NASA's technological advances, especially in testing silicon carbide electronics under Venus-like conditions, show steady improvement in durability. While human exploration remains unlikely for the foreseeable future, artificial intelligence and robotics may soon bridge this gap.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n**Venus: A Challenging Frontier for Space Exploration**\n\nVenus shines as one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, often called the \"Evening Star.\" While easily visible from Earth's safe vantage point, it has proven exceptionally challenging to examine up close. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author argues that studying Venus remains a worthy pursuit despite its inherent dangers. Three key factors make Venus particularly challenging to explore: its dangerous geology and extreme weather patterns, its atmosphere's highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds, and its scorching surface temperatures averaging over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe first challenge lies in Venus's treacherous geology and weather systems. The planet's hostile environment makes survival impossible for any known organism. As noted in the text, \"Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.\" These conditions pose significant risks to any exploration attempts.\n\nSecondly, Venus's atmosphere contains dense clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The text emphasizes this danger: \"The cloud conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\" This hostile atmosphere presents a formidable barrier to both robotic and potential human exploration.\n\nThe third major challenge is Venus's extreme surface temperature, which averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, combined with atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's.",
        "Driverless cars, once a futuristic fantasy, are rapidly becoming a reality. Companies like Google, active in this field since 2009, and BMW are pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving technology.  This exciting development, however, raises crucial questions.  Is relinquishing control to a machine truly the best course of action?  Could it create more problems than it solves?  These critical questions demand careful consideration.\n\nOne key concern revolves around safety and liability.  BMW's \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" developed in 2013, allows vehicles to handle driving functions up to 25 mph.  However, even in these limited circumstances, the driver must remain vigilant and ready to intervene.  In complex situations like work zones or accidents, human control remains essential.  Consider a pedestrian unexpectedly crossing the street: a human driver can react instinctively, while an autonomous vehicle might struggle to process the unpredictable human element, potentially leading to an accident.  The current legal framework assigns blame based on who initiates a collision.  If an autonomous vehicle is involved, determining liability becomes complex.  Is the driver at fault, or is the supposedly infallible machine to blame?  Entrusting a machine with human lives requires careful consideration beyond the allure of convenience.\n\nThe financial and experiential costs are also significant.  Over-reliance on autonomous vehicles could erode driving skills, leaving drivers less alert and less capable of handling unexpected situations.  While some argue that warning signals prompt drivers to retake control, the time allowed may be insufficient to fully assess and react to complex scenarios. This poses a particular danger to new drivers.  Furthermore, the \"cars of the future\" come with a hefty price tag, offering only partial autonomy at exorbitant cost.\n\nLooking further down the road, widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles would necessitate a complete overhaul of our current infrastructure.  Replacing existing roads with \"smart roads\" is a monumental undertaking, both in terms of time and expense.  While proponents tout the safety benefits of autonomous vehicles, the reality is that software and sensor failures can occur.  No one wants to be injured or killed due to an error by a driverless car.\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles offer potential benefits, such as reduced fuel consumption and potentially improved traffic flow, these advantages must be weighed against the considerable challenges.  The transition to a driverless future requires careful consideration of safety, liability, cost, and infrastructure.  Only then can we determine whether the human or the car will ultimately take the wheel. The development of driverless cars continues, but their widespread adoption hinges on addressing these critical issues and developing solutions that outweigh the potential problems. It remains to be seen whether these vehicles will live up to their promise or become another costly technological experiment.",

While humans are creating phenomenal innovations, not all technological advances represent genuine progress. Among the daily flood of new ideas shaping our future, one development stands out as particularly transformative: driverless cars.\n\nScientists are steadily developing autonomous vehicles equipped with sophisticated sensor systems to detect nearby objects and obstacles. However, significant challenges remain. The artificial intelligence struggles to master complex traffic scenarios and unexpected road conditions like construction zones. Legal hurdles also persist, as many states maintain laws requiring human drivers to maintain control, stating that \"the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.\"\n\nWhile proponents argue that autonomous vehicles offer enhanced safety by eliminating human errors like distracted or impaired driving, serious concerns remain. What happens if the computer system fails at a critical moment, especially if passengers have become complacent and are not prepared to take control? Additionally, these vehicles are \"something that was simply too expensive to be practical,\" putting them out of reach for most consumers.\n\nBeyond practical considerations, there are experiential drawbacks to consider. Driving represents more than mere transportation\u2014it offers a sense of freedom, control, and responsibility. The ability to personally control one's vehicle, deciding speed and direction within legal limits, is a fundamental aspect of modern mobility that autonomous vehicles would eliminate.\n\nWhile acknowledging potential benefits of this technology, particularly in reducing accidents caused by human error, we must carefully weigh the implications. The stakes are unprecedented\u2014we're no longer just risking mechanical damage but human lives. A system failure in an autonomous vehicle could have devastating consequences.",

The Case for Visiting Earth's Hostile Twin\n\nScientists are contemplating exploration of one of the most inhospitable planets in our solar system: Venus. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents compelling reasons for this ambitious endeavor, while acknowledging the significant obstacles and proposing innovative solutions.\n\nVenus, despite its current hostile environment, holds particular interest for several reasons. As Earth's closest planetary neighbor and so-called twin\u2014sharing similar density and size\u2014Venus offers unique research opportunities. The planet's geographical features mirror Earth's, with valleys, mountains, and craters dotting its surface. Perhaps most intriguingly, scientists believe Venus once hosted vast oceans and potentially even life, making it the most Earth-like planet in our solar system's history.\n\nHowever, modern Venus presents formidable challenges. Its atmosphere, composed of 97 percent carbon dioxide and laced with sulfuric acid, exerts a crushing pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. The surface environment is equally forbidding, with temperatures averaging over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Active volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes further complicate exploration efforts.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, researchers propose an innovative solution: a blimp-like vehicle operating 30 miles above the Venusian surface.",

Currently, educators often struggle to accurately gauge students' emotional states, but modern technological advances offer promising solutions. With sophisticated systems now available, we can better understand and respond to students' emotional well-being.\n\nRecent developments in facial recognition technology have made significant strides. Researchers now employ computers that can generate detailed 3-D models of human faces, incorporating all 44 major facial muscles that simulate natural human movements. This technology is particularly valuable because many students may not openly express their emotions, even when experiencing strong feelings of happiness or distress.\n\nThe technology performs complex calculations daily, analyzing subtle facial movements that might escape human observation.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, maintaining its core message while improving clarity, flow, and technical accuracy:\n\n**The Power of Facial Expressions in Educational Technology**\n\nFacial expressions often communicate our emotions more effectively than words, offering valuable insights into our feelings and reactions to various situations. The ability to interpret these expressions and adapt our environment accordingly could significantly enhance human well-being. In \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explores the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. This innovation holds particular promise for educational settings, supported by expert testimony, comprehensive technical explanations, and its potential to enhance both learning engagement and overall student happiness.\n\nThe article presents compelling evidence for FACS's educational applications through an interview with Dr. Thomas Huang, a distinguished professor at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Working alongside colleagues like Professor Nicu Sebe, Dr. Huang explains how this technology could transform the classroom experience: \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This capability for individualized response represents a significant advancement over traditional group-focused teaching methods.\n\nThe technology's sophistication is evident in its ability to distinguish genuine from feigned emotions. The article details how FACS analyzes specific muscle movements to differentiate between authentic and artificial smiles. This precision ensures that students cannot manipulate the system, maintaining its effectiveness as an educational tool.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the article's reference to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, which suggests that facial expressions not only reflect but can actually generate emotional states. The author cites renowned drama coach Constantin Stanislavsky, who utilized this principle by having actors physically reproduce expressions to evoke genuine emotions. This understanding of the bidirectional relationship between expressions and emotions underscores the potential impact of FACS in educational settings.\n\nThe implementation of FACS in classrooms worldwide could revolutionize educational experiences by creating personalized learning environments responsive to individual student emotions. This technology promises to enhance student engagement, potentially improve academic performance, and contribute to overall well-being. As we look to the future, such innovations in emotional recognition and responsive education may pave the way for even more significant advances in human-computer interaction and educational effectiveness.",
        "Students attend school every day, and throughout their day, their moods and emotions can fluctuate. Ever wondered what their emotions are? There's no need to worry anymore because a new technology has just emerged: the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which allows computers to identify human emotions. However, this tool is not suitable for classroom use.\n\nThe FACS, or Facial Action Coding System, in my opinion, should not be utilized in classrooms for several reasons. One primary reason is that students experience various emotions throughout the day. They might feel happy one moment and upset the next. Using this system would require teachers to pause class activities frequently to analyze students' facial expressions with a computer program. This practice would waste valuable learning time\u2014not only for the student being scanned but also for others who have to wait during this process.\n\nMoreover, as described in a referenced statement: \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in this model must move like human muscles.\" This indicates that before analyzing emotions, creating a facial model adds even more time to an already lengthy process.\n\nFurthermore, using FACS won't change how students feel; it merely identifies their current emotional state without offering any solutions or improvements. Whether a student is mad or sad doesn't alter how they are feeling after being scanned.\n\nIn conclusion, FACS should not be integrated into classrooms as it detracts from valuable instructional time without benefiting students' emotional well-being or enhancing classroom dynamics. The Facial Action Coding System remains an impractical tool in educational settings since it does not contribute positively toward improving anyone's experience or outcomes within schools.",
        "The \"Evening Star,\" another name for Venus, is known for its inhospitable conditions to humans. Despite the dangers and obstacles, there is ongoing debate about sending more explorations to the planet, a viewpoint supported by the author of \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus.\" The author argues that exploring Venus holds value and should be pursued.\n\nOne key point made by the author is that Earth shares similarities with Venus, making further studies on the planet essential. The author frequently emphasizes this connection by highlighting features that both planets possess. For instance, Venus still exhibits characteristics akin to Earth such as rocky terrain with valleys, mountains, and craters (Exploring Venus). This evidence underscores the author's belief in exploring Venus due to its resemblance to our own planet.\n\nMoreover, NASA should consider a manned mission to Venus as it presents a unique opportunity for planetary exploration. Given its proximity and occasional closeness to Earth compared to other planets like Mars or beyond, traveling to Venus could be more feasible in terms of time and cost (Exploring Venus). By emphasizing this point, the author underscores the practicality of exploring a neighboring planet like Venus over more distant options.\n\nAddressing how we can navigate the challenges of exploring Venus is crucial according to the author. One proposed solution involves utilizing robust yet dated technology that can withstand extreme conditions better than modern counterparts (Exploring Venus). Additionally, deploying a blimp-like vehicle in the upper atmosphere of Venus could offer a safe vantage point for exploration despite limitations on direct sampling (Exploring Venues).\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging that exploring chaotic and scorching hot environments like those found on Venus may seem daunting or impractical at first glance due their inability support life; however they also hold significant scientific value worth pursuing. The insights shared in \"The Challenges of Exploring venus\" underscore why venturing towards venus over other planets makes sense based off factors such as similarities with earth prompt arrival times potential technological solutions overcoming hurdles along journey providing worthiness visiting venus despite facing numerous challenges along way ensuring valuable outcomes derived from ultimately embarking upon missions there.",
        "Driverless cars present a complex dilemma, promising significant advantages while raising serious concerns. While proponents emphasize increased safety and convenience, the reality of transitioning to autonomous vehicles is fraught with challenges.  My primary concern lies with the level of human oversight still required, seemingly negating the concept of a truly \"driverless\" experience.\n\nCurrently, Google's autonomous vehicles, despite impressive mileage without major accidents, require driver intervention in various situations, such as navigating driveways, traffic, roadwork, and accidents.  The cars alert the driver, who must then steer, accelerate, and brake. This necessitates constant vigilance, demanding drivers keep their hands on the wheel and remain prepared to take control.  This begs the question: how \"driverless\" are these cars if constant human oversight is necessary?  Such a system seems to introduce another layer of complexity, potentially increasing the risk of human error due to complacency or delayed reaction times.\n\nFurthermore, the argument that driverless cars will reduce accidents seems flawed.  While eliminating human error is a goal, the reliance on complex automated systems introduces new potential failure points. What happens if the system malfunctions?  The driver, expected to remain alert despite the autonomous nature of the vehicle, must react instantly to regain control, potentially creating a more dangerous scenario than if they were driving conventionally.\n\nThe supposed benefits, such as fuel efficiency and flexibility, also warrant scrutiny.  While Sergey Brin's vehicles reportedly consume less fuel, the overall environmental impact of manufacturing and maintaining these complex systems remains to be seen.  Moreover, the flexibility offered compared to public transportation needs further examination, particularly regarding individual needs and accessibility.",
        "Driverless cars represent a significant advancement in modern society.  While partially autonomous vehicles exist today, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan project fully self-driving cars to be available by 2020. The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" highlights several benefits, including enhanced safety features, such as the prevention of mobile device use while the vehicle is in autonomous mode.\n\nEach self-driving car will have specific regulations. While in self-driving mode, the operator must remain alert and keep both hands on the steering wheel.  A built-in sensor in the steering wheel ensures the driver can quickly and safely take control when road conditions demand human intervention.  Another feature allows for the instant shutdown of non-essential systems. For instance, in-car entertainment, while a privilege, can be deactivated when necessary.\n\nThese self-driving cars incorporate numerous other features, including GPS, tire pressure, motion, and radar sensors.  Many newer cars already utilize rear-view cameras displayed on the dashboard.  Vibrating seats alert the driver to potential collisions. With these advancements, the operating system of a self-driving car can effectively mimic a human driver.\n\nBeyond safety features, driverless cars also offer fuel efficiency. Projections indicate these vehicles will achieve significantly better gas mileage, potentially using half the fuel of current automobiles.  As Sergey Brin stated, \"Such cars would fundamentally change the world.\"  Not only will each tank of gas last longer, but harmful emissions will also be reduced.\n\nThe development of self-driving vehicles is a significant societal achievement.",

While the technology offers the potential for safer roads and innovative transportation, its implementation requires careful consideration of various factors.\n\nThe concept of autonomous vehicles isn't new. Back in the 1950s, General Motors pioneered this technology with a car that could navigate a test track using radio signals transmitted through electrical cables. Later, engineers at Berkeley developed a similar system using magnets for guidance. However, these early attempts faced practical limitations, particularly the high cost of infrastructure modifications and the reliability of sensor technology.\n\nPopular culture, especially the movie industry, has long imagined a future with autonomous vehicles. From flying cars to self-driving vehicles, what once seemed like science fiction is becoming reality through efforts like those of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. With proper engineering and advanced electronics, these vehicles could revolutionize transportation.\n\nHowever, significant challenges remain. The implementation requires addressing several critical issues:\n- Infrastructure costs for road modifications\n- Sensor reliability and technical failures\n- New legal frameworks for liability\n- The need for specific regulations beyond traditional vehicle laws\n\nThe question of liability is particularly complex: in the event of an accident caused by technology failure, who bears responsibility? These concerns make the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles seem simultaneously imminent and distant.\n\nDespite these challenges, I believe driverless cars will ultimately benefit society. They have the potential to make roads safer and enhance driver awareness. However, success depends on maintaining a balance \u2013 while embracing the technology, we shouldn't become overly dependent on it. The key is to view autonomous vehicles as aids rather than complete replacements for human judgment. With this approach, we can welcome this innovation while managing its risks responsibly.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text about the \"Face on Mars\" phenomenon:\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" controversy began on May 24, 2001, when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft made an intriguing discovery while orbiting Mars. As the spacecraft circled the Cydonia region, it captured images of what appeared to be a shadowy figure resembling a human face. The snapshot was transmitted to Viking 2, its sister ship, and carefully analyzed by mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Their initial assessment revealed that the formation was actually a Martian mesa\u2014a common geological feature in Cydonia\u2014though this particular one cast unusual shadows that resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n\nNASA promptly shared the image with the public, accompanying it with a caption that read: \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" While NASA used the photo to generate public interest in Mars exploration, the impact exceeded their expectations. The \"Face on Mars\" became a cultural phenomenon, featuring in Hollywood films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even appearing in grocery store checkout line publications for 25 years.\n\nTo address persistent speculation about the formation, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured new images with ten times better resolution than the original. These sharper pictures definitively revealed a natural landform rather than an alien monument. When public skepticism continued, additional images were taken, confirming the formation was simply the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Jim Garvin, a NASA scientist, noted its similarity to the Middle Butte in Idaho's Snake River Plain.\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" saga demonstrates how a simple geological formation can capture public imagination and drive scientific inquiry.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n```markdown\n\"Is exploring Venus worth the risk?\" This question echoes across the scientific community and beyond. While some consider Venus exploration too hazardous, others embrace the challenge. The fundamental question remains: Should NASA proceed with this potentially perilous mission?\n\nThe author clearly advocates for Venus exploration. In the fourth paragraph, they present compelling arguments supporting Venus as a worthy pursuit. Throughout the article, their stance favoring human exploration of Venus remains consistent. However, as the saying goes, appearances can be deceiving.\n\nThough the author's vision of visiting Venus is compelling, it carries significant risks. As noted in paragraph four, \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.\" The planet fascinates astronomers due to its Earth-like characteristics, making it unique in our solar system. The fifth paragraph mentions that \"NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus,\" further reinforcing this perspective.\n\nHowever, a mission to Venus would likely prove extremely dangerous. Despite NASA's support for this initiative, some scientists argue that not every celestial body warrants exploration.",
        "The author argues that studying Venus is a worthy endeavor despite the inherent dangers. This argument is supported by the fact that Venus was once the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, which not only expands our knowledge of the planet but also drives technological advancements, making travel to Venus more feasible.\n\nIn ancient times, Venus may have closely resembled Earth. Although exploring Venus poses significant risks, scientists continue to discuss its potential as Earth's \"sister planet.\" As stated in the text, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.\" This suggests that there were\u2014and still are\u2014remarkable similarities between Venus and Earth. Scientists are captivated by these findings and are eager to venture to Venus for further exploration.\n\nTraveling to Venus is a challenging and potentially hazardous task; thus, technological advancements are necessary to withstand its harsh temperatures and atmosphere. Enhancing technology will keep people engaged in learning and drive further improvements. With these technological advancements, traveling to more extreme planets will become easier. The text highlights this by stating: \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitudes to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid unfriendly ground conditions by staying up out of harm\u2019s way.\"",
        "Driverless cars are touted as the future of transportation, but I believe their adoption would be a mistake.  Several compelling arguments support this position.\n\nFirst and foremost is the critical issue of safety. While proponents envision a world where automated vehicles eliminate human error, the reality is that technology can malfunction.  What happens when a driverless car experiences a critical failure while the occupant is asleep or otherwise not actively monitoring the vehicle? The potential for accidents and fatalities is a serious concern.\n\nThe financial implications of widespread driverless car adoption are also substantial. While this article doesn't address the issue, the technology required for autonomous driving significantly increases the cost of manufacturing. This translates to higher prices for consumers, forcing them to spend considerably more for a vehicle they cannot fully control. The cost-benefit analysis simply doesn't favor driverless cars.\n\nFurthermore, the technology itself is not yet ready for widespread deployment.  Even Google admits that a driver must be ready to take control.  If a driver is still required, the supposed benefits of driverless technology \u2013 such as allowing drivers to text or make calls \u2013 are negated.  We already have Bluetooth-enabled vehicles for hands-free communication.  GM has also highlighted the need for \"smart roads\" with embedded digital information for fully autonomous driving.  The immense cost of implementing such infrastructure makes it unlikely governments will invest in it any time soon.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling argument against driverless cars is the legal ambiguity surrounding accidents.  In a collision involving a traditional vehicle, determining liability is usually straightforward.  However, with driverless cars, assigning responsibility becomes incredibly complex.  Was the driver actively controlling the vehicle at the time of the crash, or was the car operating autonomously?  This uncertainty will inevitably lead to protracted legal battles and disputes, creating a quagmire that benefits no one.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# The Promise of Driverless Cars\n\nHave you ever felt exhausted behind the wheel, battled drowsiness, or simply wished you didn't have to drive? The future offers a promising solution: driverless cars. These autonomous vehicles offer numerous benefits, including accident prevention, reliable navigation, and a more relaxing travel experience.\n\nOne of the most compelling advantages of driverless cars is their ability to prevent accidents. These vehicles are equipped with sophisticated sensors that can detect and respond to potential hazards before a collision occurs. According to industry research, this technology has evolved significantly since the 1980s, when automakers first introduced speed sensors for antilock brakes.",
        "Technology is rapidly becoming astonishingly intelligent, exceeding what many of us realize.  One striking example is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which allows computers to identify a wide range of human emotions.  This innovation has the potential to revolutionize various fields, particularly education.\n\nAs D'Alto explains in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\"  a classroom computer equipped with FACS could recognize signs of confusion or boredom in students and subsequently adapt the lesson accordingly. This personalized approach could lead to faster and easier comprehension, enabling students, especially those struggling, to excel while simultaneously saving teachers valuable time.  By constantly modifying the lesson to maintain student engagement, FACS could cultivate exceptional learning habits from a young age.\n\nThe accuracy of FACS lies in its ability to analyze subtle muscle movements in the face. The article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" details how different emotions engage specific facial muscles. For instance, a genuine smile utilizes different muscles than a forced one, with the latter primarily involving the zygomatic major and risorius muscles.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n**Venus: Earth's Mysterious Twin**\n\nVenus, the second planet from our Sun, has long been considered the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. As one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, it has captivated astronomers and scientists for generations. Venus is so similar to Earth that it earned the nickname \"Earth's twin.\"\n\nEarly observations of Venus led scientists to believe it was covered largely in oceans due to its bluish appearance. Indeed, Venus shares remarkable similarities with Earth in terms of density, size, and proximity. Like Earth, Venus features a rocky surface composed of sediments, valleys, mountains, and craters, making it our closest candidate for planetary exploration.\n\nThe challenge of studying Venus lies in its hostile environment. Scientists have attempted to study the planet but face significant technological limitations. Traditional electronic equipment, even when made with silicon carbide, survives only about a week in Venus's extreme conditions. This has led researchers to explore alternative solutions, including a return to mechanical computers\u2014technology used from the 1800s through World War II. These mechanical devices, which operate without electronics, offer promising advantages in their resistance to pressure, heat, and other extreme forces.\n\nDespite these challenges, researchers maintain that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit. As one scientist noted, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" This optimistic perspective emphasizes the potential benefits of understanding our planetary neighbor, despite the significant obstacles.\n\nThe scientific community's determination to explore Venus reflects humanity's broader aspirations in space exploration. While we have successfully reached the Moon, Venus presents unique challenges that push the boundaries of our technological capabilities. As technology continues to advance, future generations may unlock the secrets of this fascinating planet, potentially providing invaluable insights into planetary evolution and our own Earth's future.",
        "Venus: A Worthy Pursuit Despite the Dangers\n\nVenus, often called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, easily spotted by even amateur stargazers.  This striking celestial body, frequently referred to as Earth's twin due to its similar size and density, and occasionally its proximity, deserves our attention and further exploration. While undertaking such a mission presents undeniable risks, the potential rewards of understanding our closest planetary neighbor are immense.\n\nThe question arises: why invest our time and resources in exploring Venus?  The answer lies in the tantalizing possibilities it holds.  Venus possesses features analogous to Earth, including a rocky surface with valleys, mountains, and craters. This similarity sparks curiosity about the planet's composition and history, including the potential for shared geological materials between Earth and Venus.  Furthermore, the very presence of these familiar features raises intriguing questions about the potential for other, yet undiscovered, similarities.\n\nBefore sending humans, however, a preliminary robotic mission is crucial.  A demo rover could assess unforeseen hazards and gather further data on the planet's surface and atmosphere.  This information would be invaluable in preparing a safe and effective human mission.\n\nWhile Venus presents seemingly survivable conditions for humans in its upper atmosphere, with plentiful solar power and manageable radiation levels according to some studies, significant challenges remain.  The planet's incredibly dense atmosphere, composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide, and its extreme temperatures, hot enough to liquefy metal and crush deep-sea submarines, pose considerable obstacles.  These dangers necessitate careful planning and technological innovation to ensure the safety of any human explorers.\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential benefits of a Venus mission are compelling.  Further study could unveil new information about planetary formation, the evolution of atmospheres, and perhaps even the potential for life beyond Earth.  The author's argument for Venus exploration as a \"worthy pursuit despite the dangers\" is supported by the planet's unique characteristics, the possibility of scientific breakthroughs, and the inherent human drive to explore and understand the universe around us.  By taking measured steps, beginning with robotic exploration and culminating in carefully planned human missions, the United States, through collaborative scientific efforts, could achieve a significant victory in space exploration and expand our understanding of our place in the cosmos.",
        "Have you ever struggled to read and understand a person's emotions, finding it impossible to truly grasp what they're feeling? A new technology system, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), has been developed to address this challenge by offering precise percentages of a person's emotions through a simple camera analysis. Designed to decode emotions using \"some new computer software that can recognize human emotions\" (1), FACS has already been tested on the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci, providing insights into the emotions she might be expressing. This system has the potential to be incredibly valuable in classrooms, aiding the study of human anatomy and psychology, and helping individuals to better understand one another.\n\nEmotions are often incredibly difficult to interpret, especially when they're coming from others. Typically, unless one has a close personal relationship, it can be challenging to determine how a person is feeling based solely on their appearance. Understanding emotions, however, can be beneficial, fostering better communication, enabling timely support, and preventing misunderstandings. A program like FACS, which provides the most accurate emotional percentages, can be a crucial tool. For instance, the analysis of the Mona Lisa revealed she is \"83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry\" (1).",
        "Do you believe in the supernatural or in ancient civilizations, like aliens? Well, I don't. In the passage \"Unmasking the Face of Mars,\" there are two major opinions on whether there once was a civilization on Mars or if it was a natural landform. Based on text and factual evidence, I believe that the \"face\" on Mars is a natural landform.\n\nFirst, let's consider what happened on April 8, 2001\u2014a cloudless summer day in Cydonia\u2014when the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. This means they obtained the best picture they could.\n\nMoreover, as a rule of thumb in digital imagery, you can discern objects three times larger than the pixel size. So if there were structures like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks in this picture, you would be able to see them clearly! This evidence suggests that if it was indeed a civilization, other structures should have been visible too\u2014but they aren't.\n\nFurther supporting this idea is another piece of evidence from paragraph 12: \"The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\u2014landforms common around the American West.\" Gavin remarks that \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in Idaho's Snake River Plain,\" comparing it to a lava dome with an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\n\nHowever, opposing viewpoints exist as well. The article notes that \"The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north Martian latitude where it was winter in April '98\u2014a cloudy time of year on Planet.\" Some skeptics argue that alien markings might have been hidden by haze since MGS had to peer through wispy clouds during its observation.\n\nBased solely upon expert analysis and textual evidence presented thus far\u2014I firmly maintain my stance: believing steadfastly still today\u2014that what many perceive merely just another remarkable geological formation than remnants any ancient civilization ever resided upon indeed remains intact here within our solar system itself entirely!",
        "Driverless cars are coming and are closer than we think. This essay will discuss three reasons why driverless cars are a phenomenal idea: innovation, adoption by major car companies, and safety.\n\nFirstly, driverless cars are overwhelmingly innovative. Initially, many futurists doubted the possibility of self-driving cars, believing that smarter roads, not cars, were the key. However, the founder of the Google Car project, a pioneer in the field, has stated that the technology has finally caught up to the dream, showcasing the level of innovation achieved since the project's inception in 2009.\n\nSecondly, major car companies are actively pursuing the development of driverless cars. For instance, Tesla, known for its innovation, has announced plans to release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90% of the time by 2016. Additionally, luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are aiming to introduce their own self-driving cars by 2020, indicating a widespread industry shift towards autonomous vehicles.\n\nLastly, driverless cars prioritize safety, employing a range of sophisticated technologies to ensure the well-being of passengers and pedestrians. Google, for example, has equipped its modified Toyota Prius with a variety of sensors, cameras, radar, GPS, and motion sensors, demonstrating the comprehensive safety measures taken in the development of autonomous vehicles.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the article about driverless cars, enhancing its logical flow and addressing grammatical issues:\n\n# The Case Against Driverless Cars\n\n## Safety and Technical Concerns\nThe concept of autonomous vehicles raises serious safety concerns. The idea of a car operating without human control seems not only improbable but potentially dangerous. While manufacturers promote these vehicles as technological advances, we must consider: What happens if the technology fails? Who bears responsibility in case of accidents? These critical questions remain inadequately addressed.\n\n## Human Oversight Requirements\nDespite being labeled as \"driverless,\" these vehicles still require human supervision. Drivers must remain vigilant, keeping their hands near the steering wheel to take control when necessary. This creates a paradoxical situation: Why invest in a driverless car if constant human oversight is still required?\n\n## Liability and Legal Framework\nThe question of liability in autonomous vehicle accidents presents complex challenges. Should responsibility fall on the driver who chose to use the technology, or on the manufacturers who developed it? Before widespread adoption, we need comprehensive laws governing autonomous vehicle operation and accident liability.\n\n## Technical Reliability\nManufacturers must ensure flawless operation before bringing these vehicles to market. However, like all technology, autonomous systems can fail. The consequences of such failures on public roads could be catastrophic. The current technology may not be sophisticated enough to replicate human judgment and skill in all driving scenarios.\n\n## Practical Concerns\nSeveral practical issues also merit consideration:\n- Driver engagement and alertness during autonomous operation",
        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of driverless cars. Personally, I hold a negative view on driverless cars, mainly due to the uncertainty of potential mishaps.\n\nOne concern I have regarding driverless cars is the scenario of needing to make a sudden stop in an unfamiliar location. How would the car recognize the need to stop promptly? Driverless cars could potentially lead to an increase in car accidents, as not everyone may feel comfortable or confident operating a technology they were not raised with.\n\nFurthermore, I worry about the reliability of driverless cars. Technology is not infallible, and there is always a possibility of malfunction or glitches. Entrusting one's safety to a driverless car, which is not immune to errors, seems risky to me.\n\nAdditionally, the proliferation of technology is contributing to a sedentary lifestyle, with people becoming increasingly reliant on the conveniences it offers. This dependence on technology, including driverless cars, may further promote a culture of laziness, which is another negative aspect to consider.\n\nIn conclusion, while driverless cars may represent a significant technological advancement, the potential risks and uncertainties associated with them, in my opinion, outweigh the benefits.",
        "To experience fun and new opportunities, it's important to step out of your comfort zone. If you have a desire to do something, take action and don't let others deter you from pursuing your dreams. Your self-perception holds more value than the opinions of others. Embrace who you are and consider exploring new ventures, such as studying Venus, to expand your knowledge and skills. Engaging in worthy pursuits can lead to personal growth and learning experiences that you might otherwise miss out on.\n\nOvercoming fear and uncertainty is crucial when facing challenges and new experiences. Avoid letting fear interfere with your plans and goals, as it can hinder your progress and prevent you from achieving your aspirations. Rather than dwelling on regrets, use your experiences as opportunities to learn and grow. Embrace each obstacle as a chance to improve and move forward in your personal and professional journey.\n\nAs the author emphasizes, \"Striving to meet the challenge\" is key to personal and professional growth. Don't let anything or anyone hinder your progress and dreams. Stay true to yourself, maintain confidence, and believe in your abilities.",
        "Considering the Seagoing Cowboys program?  It's a rewarding experience for several reasons: you'll be directly helping people in need by delivering essential supplies, and you'll gain invaluable hands-on experience in providing aid.\n\nThe program has a rich history.  For example, in August 1945, a group received orders to report to New Orleans.  \"We arrived August 14th,\" one participant, Luke, recalled, \"the day the Pacific war ended.\"  With their seamen's papers in hand, they boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, bound for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses, along with the necessary hay and oats.\n\nThe journey across the Atlantic from the eastern coast of the United States took approximately two weeks, and the entire trip to their final destination (presumably China, given the context) took a month.  Caring for the animals kept Luke busy. He fed and watered them two or three times a day, and constantly cleaned their stalls.\n\nLuke's previous experience working on his aunt's farm proved invaluable. The hard work he learned there translated directly to his responsibilities caring for the horses on the ship, significantly impacting his ability to handle the demanding tasks.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) offers exciting potential for classroom use.  By recognizing characteristic facial muscle movements, a classroom computer equipped with FACS could identify when a student is experiencing confusion or boredom, common classroom occurrences. This technology allows for personalized learning experiences, modifying lessons much like a human instructor, ultimately leading to improved learning outcomes.\n\nFACS identifies six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Each emotion is associated with specific movements of the facial muscles. These movements are called \"action units.\" For example, the frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above the eyes) raises the eyebrows to express surprise, while the orbicularis oris (around the mouth) tightens the lips to convey anger.\n\nBy comparing expressions against a neutral face, FACS can even analyze subtle expressions like the Mona Lisa's smile, demonstrating the system's sensitivity. This technology has broad applications beyond the classroom.",
        "Luke would likely promote the Seagoing Cowboys program as an opportunity to give back to communities while also traveling to exciting destinations you may not have visited before. The program allows participants to assist countries in Europe by delivering much-needed supplies. Additionally, participants care for various kinds of animals and have the chance to sightsee during their free time or after completing their hard work.\n\nSome intriguing destinations to visit include Europe and China, known for their historical and beautiful sites. However, before embarking on the journey to these countries, it's important to consider the potential dangers at sea. For instance, in paragraph 7, there's a mention of Luke serving as a night watchman, during which he slipped on a slippery ladder, fell, and cracked his ribs, rendering him unable to work for a few days.\n\nDespite such risks, the Seagoing Cowboys program offers the rewarding experience of bringing joy to many by helping them regain their livelihoods. It also provides personal growth and benefits to participants. Evidence of this can be found in paragraph 1, which states, \"Luke Bomberger had no idea his life would change soon after high school.\" So, come and join to make a positive impact on your life and the lives of others.",
        "With the numerous advances that car companies are making, there is no doubt that driverless cars are on their way to America's roadways. The author of this article presents some compelling arguments supporting driverless cars, but they also make points that lead me to oppose them. I have not seen enough evidence to prove their safety.\n\nCurrently, we find comfort in knowing there is a human in charge when we see a large SUV speeding down the road, hopefully paying attention to the driving task at hand. I doubt a computer could consistently make all the necessary logical decisions for safe travel. Let's consider interstate driving as an example: quick decision-making is essential when reacting to unexpected maneuvers or deciding when to overtake another vehicle. These are decisions computers might struggle with.\n\nLooking at it from a legal perspective, the author discusses some legal issues in paragraph nine and poses a crucial question: \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault \u2013 The driver or the manufacturer?\" Logically speaking, I believe fault lies with the manufacturer since it's their system controlling the vehicle and not the driver directly. Therefore, if their system fails, they should be held responsible for any resulting failures.\n\nIn conclusion, there isn't enough conclusive evidence demonstrating these cars' safety for public use. Without such proof of safety, it would be unwise to introduce them onto our roads. Moreover, manufacturers may not be prepared for shouldering responsibility if their systems malfunction. Perhaps as new advancements emerge and additional evidence surfaces my concerns may diminish; however; currently I firmly oppose introducing driverless cars into our communities.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\nWhile Prof. Thomas Huang's development of emotion-reading technology is remarkable, its implementation in classroom settings raises serious concerns about privacy and autonomy. As humans, we possess the fundamental right to freedom of speech, which encompasses not only the ability to express our opinions but also the right to keep certain aspects of ourselves private\u2014including our emotions.\n\nThe author states in paragraph 7 that while this technology exists, it won't be widely available soon: \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile.\" However, even if implementation isn't imminent, we must carefully consider whether this technology belongs in educational environments at all.\n\nConsider the complexity of human emotions and learning processes. Some students deliberately conceal their emotions from teachers for various reasons, while others prefer to work through challenges independently. If a student in an online course appears confused, they should retain the agency to decide whether they need additional instruction or are simply processing new information. Moreover, in cases where a student's expression shows 45% concentration and 55% confusion, automated intervention could disrupt their focus and lead to frustration rather than assistance.\n\nThe author's example in paragraph 6 raises additional concerns: \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" This scenario already troubles many people who consider personalized advertising invasive. The prospect of computers reading emotional responses to optimize ad delivery is particularly concerning, especially since many people rarely respond positively to advertisements, viewing them primarily as interruptions.\n\nFurthermore, the technology's ability to differentiate between lesson-related emotions and those stemming from personal circumstances remains questionable. How would the system distinguish between confusion about the current lesson and distraction from external factors?",
        "Driverless cars present significant challenges that make their widespread development for public use questionable.  These challenges center around exorbitant costs, questionable utility, and serious safety concerns.\n\nThe financial burden of developing truly driverless cars is staggering.  Equipping vehicles with the necessary sensors and cameras is just the beginning.  As some sources acknowledge, creating the infrastructure to support these vehicles, such as electrifying or magnetizing roads, is prohibitively expensive.  These vast sums could be better allocated to addressing pressing social needs rather than pursuing technological novelty.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of partially automated vehicles raises concerns about their actual usefulness.  While these cars might handle driving under normal conditions, they would still require driver intervention in complex situations like work zones or accidents.  If a driver must remain vigilant and ready to take control, the value proposition of a \"self-driving\" car diminishes significantly.  Proposed additions like in-car entertainment systems further exacerbate this issue, potentially distracting drivers and hindering their ability to react swiftly to emergencies.\n\nThis leads to the most critical concern: safety.  Proponents argue that driverless cars will improve public transport and fuel efficiency.  However, these potential benefits are overshadowed by the inherent risks.  In a fully autonomous vehicle, passengers would be helpless in the face of an unavoidable accident.  Even in partially automated cars, the presence of entertainment systems could delay driver reaction times, increasing the likelihood of accidents.\n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of driverless technology faces substantial obstacles. The immense financial investment required, coupled with the questionable practicality of partially automated systems and the overriding safety concerns, makes the large-scale development of driverless cars for public use a dubious endeavor.",
        "Would you buy a car that could drive you around without you having to do anything? Personally, I would not. There are too many things that could go wrong. We all know that technology can break down at times, as even our computers fail for no reason. So why let a car, which could end your life in a split second, drive you around? I wouldn't want to take that risk.\n\nThe passage \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" explains that even with autonomous technology, the driver has to take over at times. They mention, \"the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" But what if, one time, the car did not notify the driver, or the driver fell asleep? This could end the driver\u2019s life, and potentially, someone else\u2019s, too. Although the passage states, \"the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel,\" I know plenty of people, mostly teenagers, who would disconnect the wheel sensor. So, why take the chance, risking lives, for the sake of a driverless car?\n\nIf we are going to have driverless cars, they need to be safer before anyone can, or should, drive them.",
        "The Face on Mars: Natural or Artificial?\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" has sparked much debate, raising the question: is it a natural landform or an alien creation?  Let's explore this intriguing phenomenon.  Some believe it's evidence of extraterrestrial life, while others, myself included, maintain it's a natural occurrence.  Similar, though smaller-scale, formations exist on Earth, and we readily accept their natural origins.  Just as we see faces or objects in cloud formations without attributing them to aliens, the Martian face could be a similar illusion.\n\nMy skepticism stems from the existence of comparable formations on Earth, none of which are considered alien-made.  We routinely perceive familiar shapes in random patterns, whether in clouds or elsewhere.  The only real difference between these earthly phenomena and the face on Mars is location.\n\nThe Easter Island heads offer another interesting comparison. These massive statues bear a resemblance to the Martian face, and they, too, have been subject to theories of extraterrestrial involvement.  Ultimately, whether one believes in their alien origin is a matter of opinion, not fact.  Currently, there's no definitive proof either way regarding the Face on Mars.\n\nHowever, compelling evidence points towards a natural explanation.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text about driverless cars:\n\nThe development of driverless cars represents a crucial advancement in automotive technology that could revolutionize road safety and accessibility. Every year, countless lives are lost due to preventable accidents caused by distracted driving, particularly from texting, and impaired driving due to alcohol consumption. Autonomous vehicles offer a promising solution to these pressing issues.\n\nThese vehicles would be programmed to strictly adhere to traffic laws, maintaining proper speed limits and observing all traffic signals and signs. This systematic compliance would significantly reduce the risk of accidents caused by human error or negligence. Moreover, the constant alertness of autonomous systems would eliminate accidents caused by driver fatigue or inattention, which are major contributors to road fatalities.\n\nBeyond safety improvements, driverless cars would provide unprecedented mobility opportunities for individuals who currently face transportation challenges. People with visual impairments, physical disabilities, or other conditions that prevent them from operating traditional vehicles would gain newfound independence. This technology could open up new possibilities for transportation equity, ensuring that everyone has access to safe and reliable transportation.\n\nThe benefits of autonomous vehicles extend beyond individual users to society as a whole. By reducing accidents caused by human error and providing reliable transportation options for all members of society, driverless cars represent a significant step forward in both public safety and accessibility.",
        "In this story, I will be discussing how a supposed face made by aliens is actually just a natural landform resembling a face. This landform, known as the \"Martian mesa,\" is common around Cydonia. It has unusual shadows that create the illusion of a face, resembling an Egyptian Pharaoh, with shadows forming the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nTo support the idea that it wasn't made by aliens, consider the fact that the structure is decaying. If aliens had created it, wouldn't they have come back to fix it, ensuring it remained intact forever? It seems unlikely that they would create something only to neglect it over time.\n\nAdditionally, if aliens, presumably more advanced than us, had made this, wouldn't it have kept its shape for more than 25 years, maintaining its form against the natural elements?",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n**The Drawbacks of Facial Expression Recognition Technology in Education**\n\nNew software has emerged that analyzes students' facial expressions to determine their emotions, including happiness, sadness, and boredom. While this technology is being considered for classroom implementation to optimize learning based on emotional feedback, its use may actually be detrimental to the educational experience.\n\nThe primary concern is privacy and surveillance. As noted in the text, \"Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements\" (D'Alto 4). This continuous monitoring raises significant privacy concerns, as students would be under constant camera surveillance. Furthermore, such systems could be vulnerable to security breaches, potentially exposing students to unauthorized observation or data theft.\n\nCost presents another substantial barrier. The text emphasizes that \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile\" (D'Alto 7). This limitation necessitates specialized equipment, creating a significant financial burden for schools. If institutions cannot bear these costs, the expense might be passed on to families, potentially exacerbating educational inequities.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the technology's fundamental premise may be flawed. As Dr. Huang suggests, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\" (D'Alto 6). However, facial expressions don't always accurately reflect a student's engagement with the material. A student's confused expression might stem from a private conversation rather than the lesson content, yet the system would unnecessarily adjust the curriculum in response.\n\nThe development of students' communication skills is also at stake. Learning to articulate understanding or confusion to teachers is a crucial part of education.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves the logical flow and creates a more compelling narrative:\n\nThe Face on Mars has captivated imaginations and sparked theories about extraterrestrial life. While the formation may appear artificial at first glance, subsequent scientific investigations have revealed a different story.\n\nOn April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor provided our first breakthrough. The MOC team captured images ten times sharper than the original Viking photos from 1976, revealing what appeared to be a natural landform rather than an alien monument. However, many theorists remained unconvinced.\n\nA definitive answer came on April 8, 2001, when Malin's team captured an even more detailed image. The resolution was remarkable\u2014each pixel spanned just 1.56 meters, compared to the Viking photo's 43 meters per pixel. This level of detail would have revealed any artificial structures, from pyramids to small shacks, had they existed. Instead, the image showed what Jim Gravin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, described as a Martian version of a butte or mesa, similar to those found in the American West.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nThe technology of emotional expression analysis is revolutionary, allowing us to examine historical photographs with new insight. We can now analyze what made Abraham Lincoln appear stern in certain photographs, or understand the complex emotions behind George Washington's expressions. This technological advancement is transforming our perspective on historical figures.\n\nThis innovation deepens our understanding of the past. Consider the Mona Lisa, for instance. For centuries, scholars focused primarily on her enigmatic smile, but emotional analysis technology reveals a more complex array of emotions that had previously gone unnoticed. Her famous expression contains layers of meaning that we're only now beginning to decode.\n\nThis technology offers exciting educational opportunities. Students can select historical figures for research projects, analyzing photographs to understand their subjects' emotional states during significant moments. This scientific approach to emotional analysis may challenge previous historical interpretations and provide new insights into well-documented events.\n\nThe applications extend beyond historical analysis to contemporary situations. It can help detect genuine versus artificial expressions, particularly relevant in today's media-driven world where public figures often maintain carefully crafted personas. In educational settings, this technology could serve as an early warning system. By analyzing yearbook photos, for instance, educators might identify students experiencing emotional distress who may need support.\n\nThe potential impact of this technology is far-reaching, with applications in education, business, law enforcement, and mental health services.",

As a former member myself, I can tell you it's an extraordinary opportunity that offers unique experiences and personal growth.\n\nDuring my time with the program, I traveled to remarkable destinations that opened my eyes to the world beyond our small town. I visited the Panama Canal en route to China and explored Greece. These weren't just work trips \u2013 they offered a perfect balance of responsibility and adventure. In fact, when I turned 18 and became eligible for military service, the draft board recognized the value of my work on the cattle boats and allowed me to continue serving through the program.\n\nLife aboard the ship was never dull. During return journeys, when the animal holds were empty, we created our own entertainment. We organized baseball and volleyball games in the vacant spaces, engaged in friendly boxing and fencing matches, and enjoyed quieter activities like table tennis and whittling. Reading was also a favorite pastime during those long voyages.\n\nOf course, the job came with its challenges. During storms, we had to secure everything on board and ensure both people and cargo remained safe. I'll never forget my close call as a watchman during my second trip.

        "The use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could be a valuable tool in the classroom, as it enables a more tailored learning experience by interpreting and addressing each student's emotions effectively. By comparing a person\u2019s facial expressions to neutral ones, FACS can identify and distinguish specific emotions, providing valuable insights into a student's mindset. This technology can be instrumental in enhancing both traditional and online learning systems.\n\nIn a traditional classroom, FACS can help teachers teach more efficiently. By recognizing emotions like disgust, confusion, and boredom, educators can adjust their teaching methods, ensuring they do not become too cumbersome and providing more in-depth explanations when necessary. This adaptability can lead to more effective teaching and a better learning experience for students, as teachers can identify the moments when they need to slow down and revisit complex topics.\n\nOnline learning could benefit significantly from this technology, too. When a student is learning from a computer, it can be challenging to adjust the lesson to the student's emotional and cognitive needs. By integrating FACS, computers can recognize and respond to a student's emotions, presenting the material in different, more engaging ways. For instance, a computer can introduce a humorous example to a bored student, or, if a student appears confused, it can slow down and revisit the previous content, ensuring a more personalized and, thus, a more effective learning process.",
        "Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. In paragraph 5, the author mentions that NASA has a particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in paragraph 2, Earth's previous mission to Venus was unmanned, for good reasons, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. This may explain why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.\n\nEven more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The surface temperatures on Venus average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet. Beyond the high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments, such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes, to probes seeking to land on its surface.\n\nIn paragraph 8, the author says that striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insights to be gained on the planet itself, but also because our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",
        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.\n\nVenus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\" due to its similar density and size, and it is occasionally the closest planet to Earth in terms of distance. Many people acknowledge these similarities, although some remain skeptical, believing it to be a mere celestial body rather than a planet. This resemblance, along with its striking visibility in the sky, has earned it the nickname \"the evening star.\"\n\nScientists have extensively studied Venus to determine if it could potentially support human life. Despite their efforts, they faced numerous challenges, such as understanding the planet's hostile conditions, and ultimately paused the mission to send humans to Venus. Although the results were initially disappointing, the study of Venus led to the development of new methodologies and the naming of celestial features to enhance public understanding, as the text notes, \"Venus, sometimes called the 'evening star.'\"\n\nThe article demonstrates the resilience and innovation of the scientific community, illustrating that the pursuit of knowledge, even in the face of failure, can lead to the creation of new understanding and the achievement of unexpected successes.",
        "Wouldn't it be nice to have a car that drives and navigates itself? Driverless cars are the transportation of the future. By 2009, Google had already created a car that was almost completely independent, and many other companies, such as General Motors, had developed similar vehicles. While there are still many unknown variables to address, driverless cars represent a promising step toward the future.\n\nScientists have been working on creating driverless cars for years. As of 2009, Google developed a nearly autonomous car, capable of performing most driving tasks. However, it still required driver control in situations like construction zones. These cars have alert systems to notify the driver when human assistance is needed, ensuring they remain safe to operate, even if not entirely independent.\n\nMost driverless cars being developed today are equipped with a wide array of sensors. These sensors enable the cars to distinguish their surroundings, offering the highest level of safety possible. They are also more fuel-efficient and eco-friendly, consuming less fuel and featuring numerous safety enhancements. These innovations allow the cars to provide a 360-degree view, ensuring the passenger's safety and comfort.\n\nCurrently, many of these cars still require human attention. They are equipped with vibrating seats and sensors on the steering wheel to ensure the driver remains alert. Eventually, these cars will navigate all situations without human support, allowing passengers to enjoy the ride, travel longer distances, and maintain confidence in their safety.",
        "The problem with driverless cars raises several safety concerns. What happens if the system fails and the occupant doesn't know how to drive?  What if a malfunction occurs, or the car breaks down and the person inside can't fix it?\n\nConsider this: You're alone in a driverless car, traveling through a remote area, when the system suddenly stops working.  If you don't know how to drive, you're stranded.  Or, imagine navigating heavy traffic when the car unexpectedly ceases autonomous operation.  If you can't take control, a serious accident could occur.\n\nMalfunctions present another set of dangers.  Suppose you're driving in a city and the car fails to stop at a red light.  This could result in a collision, injuries, or even fatalities. The car could also veer off the road or crash into a building.  Similarly, a sudden, uncontrolled acceleration or deceleration could have devastating consequences.\n\nBreakdowns in driverless cars pose unique challenges.  Imagine your car breaks down on a deserted back road.  Without mechanical knowledge, your options are limited: abandon the vehicle, call for help, or attempt to diagnose the problem yourself.  Even in heavy traffic, a malfunction can lead to accidents and potentially fatal outcomes.\n\nThese are just a few potential problems associated with driverless cars. While the technology holds promise, it's crucial to address these safety concerns before widespread adoption.  Hopefully, manufacturers can mitigate these risks to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles.",
        "Twenty-five years ago, something very uncommon happened on our planetary neighbor, Mars. NASA launched a shuttle named \"Viking 1\" into space, designed to take pictures of planets and to scout for possible landing sites for its sister ship, Viking 2. As Viking 1 captured images, it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. This face, with an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end, appeared to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. These are some of the intriguing details about the \"Human Face.\"\n\nEven though I am a scientist at NASA, some of my colleagues and I, who are also scientists, agreed it was probably just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia. This one, however, had unusual shadows, making it resemble an Egyptian Pharaoh. I was discussing the \"Face\" with a colleague, John, who believed it was created by aliens. I told him that we had unveiled the image for the public, noting, \"a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows, giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"",
        "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold immense potential, but also present significant safety challenges. While the idea of driverless cars may seem appealing, a critical examination of their potential risks is necessary.  A primary concern revolves around the potential for technology failure and the resulting impact on both occupants and those sharing the road.\n\nSafety is paramount with AVs. Unlike traditional vehicles where human drivers are expected to be alert, AVs demand a shared vigilance.  Current traffic laws are predicated on human control, placing responsibility squarely on the driver.  With AVs, this responsibility becomes more diffuse. While proponents argue that sensors and monitoring systems will prevent accidents, the question remains: what happens when these systems fail? Human drivers are responsible for maintaining their vehicles; however, ensuring the constant, perfect operation of complex AV technology presents a significant challenge.  A driver may not be equipped to diagnose or address a malfunctioning system, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences.\n\nFurthermore, the safety of those outside the AV is a critical concern.  Even with a perfectly functioning AV, the unpredictable actions of other drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians introduce significant risk.  Pedestrians, in particular, are vulnerable as they have no control over the AV's actions.  A malfunctioning sensor or software glitch could lead to pedestrian injuries or fatalities, raising complex questions of liability.  Even minor technical issues could have devastating consequences.\n\nWhile the convenience of not driving may be attractive, the potential for malfunctions during operation is substantial. Proponents might argue that proper maintenance is the solution. However, ensuring the continuous, flawless performance of a complex technological system is far more challenging than routine car maintenance. A significant concern is the driver's potential inability to recognize or resolve technical issues, leading to unexpected breakdowns or malfunctions.\n\nThe allure of autonomous vehicles is undeniable, especially given their potential to alleviate the burden of driving.  However, prioritizing safety and ensuring robust, reliable technology are crucial.  Technology, however sophisticated, is fallible. The potential for failure necessitates a cautious approach to the widespread adoption of AVs.",

        "Let me help restructure this text about Venus exploration to improve its flow and coherence. Here's the edited version:\n\n# The Challenge of Exploring Venus\n\nVenus, often referred to as Earth's twin, is the second planet from our sun and our closest planetary neighbor. In terms of density and size, Venus bears the closest resemblance to Earth among all planets in our solar system. Due to the varying orbital speeds of Earth, Venus, and Mars, sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.\n\nDespite its proximity, Venus presents formidable challenges for exploration. A thick atmosphere composed of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide envelops the planet, accompanied by clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's. These extreme conditions would crush even deep-sea submarines and liquefy many metals.\n\nGiven such inhospitable conditions, one might question the scientific community's interest in exploring Venus. However, astronomers are particularly fascinated by Venus because it may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Scientists believe that long ago, Venus was likely covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, similar to Earth. Even today, Venus maintains some Earth-like features, including rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proposed an innovative solution to overcome Venus's hostile environment. Their concept involves a blimp-like vehicle that would hover approximately 30 miles above the Venusian surface. At this altitude, while temperatures would still reach around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the air pressure would be comparable to sea level on Earth.",

However, exploring this planet poses significant challenges. In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author discusses why Venus exploration is fraught with danger but also why it captures scientists' curiosity. The article delves into the potential risks and rewards of such an endeavor, shedding light on Venus's composition and its intriguing history. Through a combination of data-driven insights, Q&A exchanges, and a historical perspective on past explorations of Venus, the author presents a compelling argument.\n\nData-based information plays a crucial role in outlining the hazards associated with exploring Venus. For instance, the author highlights that temperatures on its surface can soar above 800 degrees Fahrenheit, while atmospheric pressure exceeds that experienced on Earth by 90 times (Paragraph 3). These extreme conditions underscore why human missions to Venus would be perilous, making exploration seemingly unfeasible. By providing such detailed facts, not only does the author bolster their argument but they also educate readers about the complexities that make NASA's interest in Venus so profound.\n\nThe use of question-and-answer segments further reinforces the dangers inherent in exploring Venus. By addressing common queries like \"Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?\" (Paragraph 4), the author demonstrates their expertise while engaging readers' curiosity. This approach not only lends credibility to their claims but also fosters trust among readers who seek comprehensive insights into potential missions to Venus.\n\nMoreover, drawing upon historical accounts of previous explorations enriches the narrative and strengthens the author's assertions regarding Venetian exploration challenges.

        "The face on Mars is fake because on the day the face was first seen, outside was very foggy. This means that the cameras would have to see through haze. However, some still thought that the face was made by aliens, even though it was winter and in bad weather.\n\nThen later we took a picture of the face on a clear day and didn't see a face. This makes me think that there has never been a face on Mars.\n\nAnother reason that I think the face on Mars is fake is because the statue was supposed to be approximately two miles long and maybe even longer. This makes it seem unreasonably tall. If the face were two miles tall, then many of the other rocks would be smaller, but they are not; actually, the surrounding rocks are much bigger.\n\nMy last reason for doubting if there ever existed a Face on Mars is because our pictures aren't of high quality. The original camera took 43 meters per pixel, while in 2001 each pixel represented 1.56 meters - leading to no evidence of any actual structure resembling a human-like figure or statue.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone now needs to know that the \"face\" found on Mars mountain is an optical illusion due to poor weather conditions during photo capture and low-resolution imagery from outdated cameras employed by NASA at different times.",

        "In 1976, camera resolution was not high enough to capture clear photos, leading to a blurry image of what appeared to be a face on Mars. This lack of clarity fueled conspiracy theories suggesting alien involvement in creating the face-like formation. However, by 2001, advancements in technology provided a clearer image, revealing that the face was likely a natural landform or a result of human or spacecraft activity. Despite the speculation, there is no concrete evidence to support the idea that the face on Mars was created by aliens, as it lacks the complexity and sophistication one would expect from extraterrestrial artwork.\n\nNASA has conducted research on the face on Mars, studying the object to determine its origins. In contrast, conspiracy theorists rely on speculation and popular opinion, without conducting any research of their own. Some conspiracy theorists believe that NASA is hiding the truth about the face on Mars to protect their budget, suggesting a cover-up of potential alien involvement. However, the likelihood of NASA being correct in their findings is high, given their in-depth analysis of the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the face on Mars is most likely a natural landform, the result of human activity, or a formation from a spacecraft, rather than the work of aliens.",

The author argues that advancing our understanding of Venus is crucial as scientific capabilities and experimental methods continue to evolve.\n\nResearch suggests that Venus may have once been remarkably Earth-like, potentially harboring conditions suitable for life. \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth,\" the author notes, adding that it remains \"our nearest option for a planetary visit.\" This historical similarity to Earth opens intriguing possibilities for future human exploration and potential habitability.\n\nThe challenges are formidable: Venus's surface temperature reaches 800 degrees Fahrenheit, its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth, and the planet experiences intense volcanic activity, seismic events, and frequent lightning strikes. However, these obstacles could drive technological innovation. As the author explains, \"Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\" The technological advances required for Venusian exploration could pave the way for more ambitious space missions and scientific discoveries.\n\nSuccessfully establishing a human presence on Venus would represent a landmark achievement in space exploration.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System, created by Dr. Paul Ekman, is a sophisticated computer system that constructs a 3-D model of the human face. While some may dismiss this technology as unnecessary, there is more to the Facial Action Coding System than meets the eye. This innovative system has the capability to analyze the emotional expressions of students in a classroom setting. This ability proves extremely valuable as it can detect when a student is feeling confused or bored and adapt the lesson accordingly. Since much of human communication is nonverbal, these computers are programmed to respond like humans in any situation.\n\nIn a typical classroom scenario where multiple students are engaged in learning from their teacher, it's common for some students to become disinterested or perplexed by certain lessons. The Facial Action Coding System, as explained by Dr. Huang, can \"recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" Just imagine having access to technology that enables you to understand your students' emotions better! Such a tool would be an invaluable asset for any educator striving to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment.\n\nFurthermore, this system not only detects students' emotions but also adjusts lessons accordingly when boredom or confusion is detected. According to Dr. Huang, it can \"modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This adaptive technology can cater specifically to individual student needs; whether it's helping a struggling learner grasp complex concepts or assisting students with attention disorders like ADHD. With this system in place, teachers gain insights into their classrooms' dynamics and ensure all their students receive tailored support.\n\nLastly, the Facial Action Coding System operates on principles mimicking human behavior due to its understanding that most human communication is nonverbal and emotional in nature\u2014a fact highlighted by Dr.Huang: \"Most human communication is nonverbal... So computers need to understand that too.\" By replicating human responses effectively within classroom settings through nonverbal cues interpretation and adaptability features akin to genuine interpersonal interactions\u2014the system fosters trust between teachers and students.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating the Facial Action Coding System into classrooms enhances teaching practices significantly\u2014it identifies emotional states such as confusion or boredom among learners and adjusts lessons accordingly while operating functionally similar to interacting with another person.",

        "Studying Venus is a worthwhile endeavor, despite the inherent dangers it presents, as the author suggests. Venus, often referred to as Earth's \"twin\" due to its proximity, has captured the interest of many, even as others focus on Earth-based geography. This fascination with Venus stems from its unique characteristics and the potential insights it offers.\n\nVenus, although not the closest to the Sun, has the hottest surface temperature of any planet, even surpassing Mercury. This extreme heat, resulting from its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, can lead to erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes, highlighting the planet's dangerous nature. Nevertheless, the allure of Venus lies in its Earth-like qualities, as, in the distant past, it, too, was covered in vast oceans, potentially supporting different forms of life, much like Earth, which is rich in various bodies of water.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\" has sparked a lot of intrigue.  A few days after NASA's Viking 1 orbiter photographed the region of Cydonia, images revealed what appeared to be a human face. This naturally led to some wild speculation.  Given the time and resources dedicated to researching the possibility of human life on Mars, and the scientific consensus that it's currently uninhabitable, the idea of a human face on the planet seems impossible.  Some have even suggested aliens as a possible explanation.  Wouldn't we have found other evidence of their presence by now, though?\n\nThe most logical explanation, and the one supported by scientific evidence, is that the \"face\" is simply a natural landform.  While it initially seemed bizarre, this theory holds the most weight.\n\nUpon closer examination, scientists identified the feature as just another Martian mesa, a common geological formation in the Cydonia region.  Subsequent, higher-resolution images confirmed this assessment, revealing the \"face\" to be a natural landform, debunking the idea of an alien monument.  All available evidence points to this single, conclusive explanation. The \u201cface\u201d on Mars is nothing more than a trick of light and shadow on a natural geological formation.",
        "Venus, the second planet from the Sun in our Solar System, is also known as the \"Evening Star.\" It is easily visible from Earth, but exploring it up close presents significant challenges. With a surface temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and an atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide and sulphuric acid, Venus is a harsh and inhospitable environment. The extreme conditions on Venus make it a difficult target for exploration, with no spacecraft having successfully landed on its surface for three decades. The harsh environment, with temperatures that could melt metal and crush submarines, presents a formidable obstacle to exploration.\n\nDespite these challenges, NASA is considering sending humans to study Venus, with potential missions to explore the planet's surface from a safe distance. While the surface conditions are hostile, the atmosphere at higher altitudes could be more tolerable, with temperatures around 170 degrees Fahrenheit and air pressure comparable to Earth's sea level. This presents an opportunity for scientific exploration, with the potential for solar power to sustain human missions in the Venusian atmosphere. However, the dense atmosphere of Venus limits the ability to gather detailed data and samples, highlighting the need for innovative technologies to enhance our understanding of the planet.\n\nNASA is exploring alternative approaches, such as the development of mechanical computers and silicon carbide electronics, to withstand the extreme conditions of Venus.",

I opened it to find Don Reist, who invited me to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't refuse.\n\nIt was 1945. World War II raged in Europe, leaving many countries devastated.  These ravaged nations desperately needed supplies and food, aid that I and others would deliver.\n\nForty-four nations united to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). The organization hired \"Seagoing Cowboys\" to care for the horses, cows, and mules being shipped overseas. Don and I signed up for the job.\n\nWe arrived on August 14th, the day the war in the Pacific ended.  Don and I received our seaman's papers and boarded the SS *Charles W.

        "For over a million years, humans have been attempting to discover extraterrestrial life. Despite venturing into space multiple times and deploying numerous space robots into orbit, we have yet to find any evidence of aliens. This raises an intriguing question: why have we not discovered aliens yet?\n\nOne possible explanation is that some phenomena thought to indicate alien life are, in fact, natural landforms. For instance, a notable example is the \"face\" on Mars. The appearance of a human face is a result of shadows forming the \"eyes, nose, and mouth,\" creating an illusion. This suggests that the \"face\" is merely a natural rock formation, not an alien monument. This perspective is supported by the biblical account in Genesis, which implies that only humans were created to inhabit the Earth, with no mention of aliens.\n\nScientific evidence also supports the idea that the \"face\" on Mars is a natural landform. In paragraph seven of the article, it is stated, \"There was no alien monument after all.\" This conclusion, reached by scientists, is further corroborated by the space station, which, on April 8, 2001, observed the \"face\" landform. Due to the pixelation, the \"face\" no longer seemed to resemble a human, reinforcing the natural landform theory.",
        "Let me help restructure this text to create a more coherent argument against emotion-recognition technology in classrooms:\n\n**The Limitations of Emotion-Recognition Technology in Educational Settings**\n\nThe implementation of emotion-recognition technology in classrooms presents several significant concerns. First and foremost, the fundamental premise of using technology to detect students' emotions seems flawed. Teachers can already observe students' facial expressions and body language, making the technology redundant. More importantly, if a student is struggling, the solution lies in personal interaction\u2014teachers should initiate private conversations rather than rely on automated systems.\n\nPrivacy and authenticity pose additional challenges. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotions are being monitored in front of their peers, potentially leading to increased anxiety or self-consciousness. Furthermore, the technology's reliability is questionable, as it relies heavily on facial expressions which can be misleading. As noted in the passage, \"even though individuals show varying degrees of expression... the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements.\" However, many people are adept at masking their true feelings with fake smiles or expressions, rendering the technology's readings potentially inaccurate.\n\nThe practical implications also raise concerns.",
        "For those who do not believe in aliens, this may seem like nothing more than a mere coincidence. We lack concrete evidence to suggest that aliens were responsible for creating this phenomenon, let alone that there exists an entire alien civilization on Mars. Similar landforms can be found on Mars, as well as on Earth, that bear a resemblance to faces or objects that might appear to be of man-made or even \"alien\" origin. However, the mere presence of a landform resembling a face does not necessarily imply the existence of extraterrestrial life on Mars. The discovery of alien life on Mars would undoubtedly be a significant breakthrough for NASA, providing valuable insights into the nature of such life forms, their habitats, and more. Yet, attributing the creation of a face-shaped landform to alien life without concrete evidence to support this claim is premature.\n\nIn 1976, a photograph captured an image that did indeed resemble a face. However, it is important to note that the technology available at that time was not as advanced as it is today. If the same photo were taken with today's high-tech equipment, the image would likely be clearer and more detailed. Additionally, subsequent photographs taken on April 5, 1998, revealed sharper images, dispelling the notion of an alien monument.\n\nIn the final analysis, one could argue that aliens are, in fact, real, and that they played a role in the creation of the landform in question. Yet, the truth remains that, as of now, there is a lack of concrete, empirical evidence to support the theory that alien life forms were the architects of this landform, or that there are alien civilizations on Mars.",

        "The introduction of driverless cars seems like a dream come true\u2014no more worrying about horrific car accidents or the temptation to text and drive simultaneously, right? Wrong. While the concept of driverless cars may seem appealing, I believe they pose significant concerns, especially when it comes to interfering with a person's fate. Moreover, the advent of driverless cars could contribute to an even lazier society and result in job losses for driving instructors. The introduction of autonomous vehicles could lead to increased human laziness, a rise in car accidents, and unemployment for many around the world.\n\nCar accidents can occur anywhere, anytime, and they are not a pleasant sight. Most accidents happen during \"rush hour\" and on highways. Now, consider the potential increase in accidents with \"smart\" cars driving themselves. The damage could be catastrophic. In the referenced passage, paragraphs 7-8, it is emphasized that, although these cars are computer-engineered, they would still require human assistance when necessary. A line from paragraph 7 states, \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" This highlights the need for human alertness, even with smart cars. But, what if the technology in the smart car fails to provide the necessary alerts and warnings to the human driver, leading to a major accident?",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# The Case Against Driverless Cars\n\nThe article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" presented an intriguing perspective on autonomous vehicles. However, I firmly oppose the implementation of driverless cars for several critical reasons: the potential increase in accidents, technological vulnerabilities, and prohibitive costs.\n\n## Safety Concerns and Accident Risks\n\nThe primary concern with autonomous vehicles is the increased risk of accidents. While many drivers, particularly teenagers, already struggle with distracted driving, driverless cars present a unique challenge. In situations requiring immediate human intervention, passengers who aren't actively monitoring the road may fail to respond in time. Current accident rates are already concerning, and introducing autonomous vehicles could exacerbate this problem. Furthermore, as noted in passage 9, liability becomes unclear when accidents result from technical glitches\u2014should responsibility fall on the passenger or the manufacturer?\n\n## Technological Reliability Issues\n\nAlthough we live in an era of rapid technological advancement, no system is infallible. Autonomous vehicles could face various technical failures, including:\n- Computer system crashes leading to complete vehicle shutdown\n- Electrical malfunctions causing loss of control\n- Potential fire hazards or explosions due to system failures\n\nRecent history provides a cautionary tale with the \"Hoverboard,\" where a seemingly advanced technology proved dangerous when units spontaneously combusted during normal use. Similar risks could apply to driverless cars.\n\n## Financial Implications\n\nWith companies projecting driverless car releases by 2020, the anticipated cost raises significant concerns. Potential buyers should carefully consider the value proposition, weighing the substantial purchase price against the associated risks. Additional expenses, such as fuel costs\u2014which continue to rise\u2014further impact the total cost of ownership. The fundamental question becomes: Does the technology justify its premium price point, given the potential risks?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe combination of increased accident risks, technological uncertainties, and substantial costs makes driverless cars an inadvisable development in automotive technology.",

However, this doesn't mean the computer understands our emotions. It only recognizes the physical configuration of facial muscles.\n\nTherefore, using this technology in a classroom is problematic. A teacher might wrongly conclude a student is angry based on a computer's interpretation of their facial expression, even if the student is happy or sad.\n\nSimilarly, if the program indicates a student is happy when they are actually sad, their friends might tease them, leading to unwanted conflict and hurt feelings.\n\nIt's simply not possible for a computer to reliably determine our emotional state.",
        "Venus is possibly the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density, which might make one believe that humans could potentially live on Venus just as we do on Earth. Although Venus is similar to Earth in some aspects, it is also vastly different. For instance, Venus's atmosphere is composed of 97% carbon dioxide, resulting in surface temperatures that average around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions are far too extreme for human survival. However, we might eventually create or discover technologies that can withstand these harsh environments.\n\nEarth is home to a diverse range of cloud shapes and sizes. While some clouds are simply beautiful to behold, others can be harmful, such as smog, which is a mixture of fog and pollution that can damage our skin. Venus, too, has clouds, but they pose a greater threat. Venus's atmosphere contains highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds, which could be deadly to humans and are capable of corroding many types of metal, presenting a significant challenge to exploring the planet.\n\nIn conclusion, the harsh conditions on Venus do not necessarily have to be insurmountable, provided we can innovate to counteract them. The author believes that there is a way for humans to study Venus, and perhaps, in the future, make it habitable.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the essay on driverless cars:\n\n**The Promise and Perils of Autonomous Vehicles**\n\nDriverless cars represent one of the most significant technological advances in modern transportation, though their impact remains a subject of debate. While these vehicles offer potential benefits, they also raise important concerns about safety, liability, and human control.\n\n**Understanding Driverless Technology**\n\nThe term \"driverless car\" requires clarification. From a consumer perspective, these are vehicles that can transport passengers to their destinations with minimal human intervention. However, as Google co-founder Sergey Brin explains, current autonomous vehicles still require human oversight. These cars can handle basic functions like steering, acceleration, and braking, but are designed to alert drivers when human intervention becomes necessary. As noted in the research, \"While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver,\" highlighting the collaborative relationship between human and machine.\n\n**Safety and Performance**\n\nThe safety record of autonomous vehicles appears promising at first glance. Reports indicate that these cars have logged up to half a million miles without accidents. However, this success relies heavily on sophisticated sensor systems and constant human supervision. While the technology may reduce certain types of accidents, it introduces new considerations about the balance between automated and human control.\n\n**Legal and Liability Concerns**\n\nOne of the most pressing questions surrounding driverless cars involves liability in the event of an accident. Who bears responsibility when an autonomous vehicle is involved in a collision \u2013 the driver or the manufacturer? This uncertainty could have significant implications for both consumers and manufacturers, potentially affecting insurance policies and legal frameworks.\n\n**A Balanced Perspective**\n\nWhile driverless cars offer the alluring promise of enhanced safety and convenience, particularly for families concerned about road safety, their implementation requires careful consideration. The technology may indeed prove beneficial, but it's essential to maintain realistic expectations and understand both its capabilities and limitations.",

        "Here's a polished version of your essay on driverless cars:\n\n# The Case Against Autonomous Vehicles: A Safety Perspective\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles represent an impressive technological advancement, I have serious concerns about their widespread implementation. Despite their innovative nature, the potential risks outweigh the benefits. Three key factors support this position: unpredictable human drivers, various road hazards, and challenging weather conditions.\n\n## The Human Factor\n\nTraditional drivers already pose significant challenges on our roads through behaviors like speeding, illegal maneuvers, and failure to signal. While human drivers can instinctively react to these unpredictable situations, autonomous vehicles may struggle to adapt. Although these vehicles can follow traffic rules precisely, they lack the human intuition necessary to anticipate and avoid reckless drivers. This limitation could lead to accidents and ultimately affect consumer confidence in autonomous technology.\n\n## Road Hazards and Infrastructure Challenges\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles can recognize and respond to major obstacles like construction zones, their ability to detect and navigate smaller hazards remains questionable. Consider common road hazards like potholes or debris\u2014situations where human judgment and experience prove invaluable. In smaller cities with varying road conditions, the limitations of autonomous systems become particularly apparent. The technology's inability to recognize and respond to novel obstacles poses a significant safety risk.\n\n## Weather-Related Concerns\n\nDespite advanced features like individual wheel control and skid prevention, autonomous vehicles face substantial challenges in adverse weather conditions. Several scenarios raise concerns:\n\n- Heavy snowfall could obstruct crucial sensors\n- Severe hailstorms might damage sensitive equipment\n- Flash floods in areas not mapped for flood risk\n- Variable weather patterns that require human judgment\n\nWhile manufacturers may offer solutions for these scenarios, none can guarantee perfect performance across the wide spectrum of weather conditions drivers encounter.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe reliability of human judgment, developed through years of driving experience, remains superior to autonomous systems. Our ability to anticipate dangers, recognize hazards, and understand local weather patterns makes manual driving the safer choice. While technology can enhance our lives in many ways, entrusting our safety entirely to autonomous vehicles seems premature and potentially dangerous.",
        "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" explores both the promises and pitfalls of autonomous vehicles.  While driverless cars have been in development since at least 2009 and have logged hundreds of thousands of miles without incident, significant challenges remain.  One major concern is the cost of implementation and the question of liability in the event of an accident. Determining fault when a crash involves autonomous vehicles presents a complex legal challenge.  Furthermore, the expectation that drivers remain alert even in autonomous vehicles seems counterintuitive and potentially costly in terms of training and system design.\n\nMany drivers struggle to maintain focus on the road due to distractions like texting and phone calls.  Driverless cars offer the potential to mitigate these risks, but their capabilities are limited. While Google, for example, has been developing autonomous vehicles since 2009 that can operate under specific conditions, these systems are not yet foolproof.  These vehicles utilize sensors and sophisticated software to interpret their surroundings, much like the technology used in anti-lock brakes, which has advanced considerably over the past decade. Continued advancements in sensor technology, computer hardware, and software promise to make driving safer and potentially free up drivers' time for other activities.  Ideally, driverless cars would enhance the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians.\n\nHowever, the financial burden of implementing widespread autonomous vehicle systems is substantial.  Upgrading existing infrastructure to support smart-road systems is a significant hurdle. The specialized sensors required for these vehicles are not readily available and come at a premium cost.  Maintaining driver alertness presents another challenge.",
        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author argues compellingly for further exploration of Earth's twin, Venus, despite its extreme environment.  The author maintains that these conditions, while harsh, are not insurmountable for human ingenuity.\n\nWith a little creativity and curiosity, the author suggests, we can unlock Venus's secrets. While past missions have faced significant challenges, with most spacecraft succumbing to the planet's harsh conditions within hours, this shouldn't deter further exploration.  The author questions why scientists would even attempt these missions if they believed life there was impossible.\n\nThe article highlights astronomers' fascination with Venus, noting, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" This possibility that Venus once supported life raises the intriguing question of whether it could do so again.\n\nWhile acknowledging the dangers of Venus's current conditions, the author believes solutions can be found.  One proposed solution, described in the article, is a \"blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.\" This approach would allow exploration while avoiding the intense surface temperatures and pressures. However, the author concedes that remote observation from such a vehicle would provide limited data about ground conditions.\n\nThe article also highlights NASA's innovative work developing silicon carbide electronics capable of withstanding Venus's harsh environment.  It mentions, \"some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\"  This represents significant progress compared to the mere hours of operational capacity of previous spacecraft.\n\nThe author expresses hope that NASA's continued advancements will eventually enable safe human exploration of Venus.",

        "Twenty-five years ago, the phenomenon known as \"The Face on Mars\" captured public attention. Some people speculated that the face, a widely recognized formation discovered by NASA, was of alien origin. However, it was later determined to be a natural formation.\n\nOn April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor, during its first flyover of the Cydonia region since the Viking 1 mission discovered the face in 1976, captured a new, much sharper image. Michael Malin, along with his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team, took a photograph that was ten times more detailed than the original Viking images, revealing, as the Mars Global Surveyor team confirmed, a natural landform.\n\nDespite the evidence, some people, including conspiracy theorists, remained unconvinced, citing the haze, winds, and cloudy conditions, which, they claimed, could obscure alien markings, as the reason for the natural appearance.",
        "The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, with all 44 major muscles in the model moving like human muscles. Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving facial muscles not only expresses emotions but may also produce them.\n\nThe claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is remarkable and could potentially reduce the risk of suicide and bullying among students. This technology could help keep people's minds focused and possibly make them more open-minded. For instance, if the computer detects sadness, it might suggest a game or video that could alter the person's mood.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nThe Face on Mars has captivated public imagination for decades, though many dismiss the idea of its alien origins. More likely, this intriguing formation resulted from natural processes such as storms or meteor impacts. NASA prioritized photographing this distinctive rock formation, and scientists generally concluded it was simply another Martian mesa, a common geological feature in the Cydonia region.\n\nWhen NASA first released the image, they labeled it simply as a \"huge rock formation.\" Scientists noted that the face-like appearance resulted from shadows creating the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. An opportunistic author later recognized the formation's potential to generate public interest in Mars exploration.\n\nThe Face quickly became a worldwide cultural phenomenon, appearing in Hollywood films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and tabloid headlines. Some interpreted it as potential evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars, leading to speculation about NASA withholding information. Others suggested that supporters of NASA's budget might welcome the possibility of an ancient Martian civilization.\n\nOn April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor captured new, detailed images of the formation. As Jim Garvin explained, \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view.\" Malin's team obtained high-resolution photographs using the camera's maximum capabilities. The 2001 images achieved remarkable clarity, with each pixel representing 1.56 meters\u2014a dramatic improvement from the 1976 Viking photos' 43 meters per pixel.\n\nWhile the true nature of the Face on Mars remains a subject of debate, scientists have conducted extensive research to understand its origins. Most experts consider it a Martian butte or mesa, similar to geological formations found on Earth. Though some still speculate about artificial origins, the scientific consensus leans toward natural geological processes. While both possibilities persist in public discourse, definitive proof remains elusive.",
        "I strongly support the development of smart/driverless cars for several compelling reasons: their potential for increased fuel efficiency, enhanced safety features, and reduced driver burden.\n\nThese vehicles promise significant fuel savings, potentially using half the fuel consumed by current taxis.  This efficiency, combined with their personalized routing, offers greater flexibility than public transportation options like buses.  Replacing traditional taxi services with driverless cars also eliminates the potential for human driver error. While the passenger becomes solely responsible for their safety, the removal of human unpredictability from other drivers significantly enhances overall road safety.\n\nSmart cars excel at detecting and responding to road hazards. Equipped with advanced sensors and technology, they can react to dangers faster than a human driver, preemptively applying brakes and mitigating potential collisions. Features like \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" while still requiring driver alertness, automate much of the driving process in challenging traffic situations, increasing both safety and convenience.\n\nFurthermore, these vehicles offer a safer driving experience even with reduced driver control.  While some might find this paradoxical, the consistent and predictable nature of automated systems minimizes risks associated with human error.  As Werner Huber, a project manager from BMW, points out, this shift requires us to \"interpret driving in a fun new way.\"",

        "Here's my restructured version of the text, improving flow and coherence while maintaining the key information:\n\n# The Face on Mars: Natural Formation, Not Alien Civilization\n\n## Introduction\nWhen a peculiar face-like formation was discovered on Mars, it sparked widespread controversy and speculation about potential alien civilization. However, scientific investigation has definitively proven that this formation is nothing more than a natural landform, similar to Earth's mesas and buttes.\n\n## Scientific Investigation Timeline\nIn 1976, Viking captured the first images of the formation in Cydonia, with relatively low resolution of forty-three meters per pixel. These grainy images fueled initial speculation about artificial structures. \n\nNASA launched further investigations to settle the debate:\n- 1998: Mars Global Surveyor's initial flyover of Cydonia\n- 2001: Follow-up mission with high-resolution imaging\n\n## Definitive Evidence\nThe 2001 photographs provided conclusive evidence, with dramatically improved resolution of just two meters per pixel\u201422 times more detailed than the 1976 images. As Jim Garvin, NASA's Mars Exploration Program chief scientist, noted, \"If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n\n## Geological Context\nThe formation's natural origins become clear when comparing Mars's environment to similar Earth landscapes.

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n**The Facial Action Coding System: Revolutionizing Emotion Recognition in Education**\n\nThe Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is sophisticated software that analyzes facial expressions to detect and interpret human emotions. For instance, if someone is experiencing sadness, the system can identify and report this emotional state through advanced facial analysis. This groundbreaking technology represents an unprecedented advancement in emotion recognition.\n\nFACS has diverse applications across multiple fields, including education, art, and law enforcement. In educational settings, it offers particularly promising benefits by helping teachers better understand their students' emotional states during the learning process.\n\nConsider a mathematics classroom scenario: Dr. Huang notes that \"when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" FACS can alert the instructor to these emotional cues. This real-time feedback enables teachers to adapt their teaching methods more effectively. If the system detects student confusion, the instructor can rephrase explanations or try alternative teaching approaches. Similarly, when signs of disengagement appear, teachers can either re-engage students or provide necessary breaks to maintain optimal learning conditions.\n\nThis innovative technology offers significant advantages for education and various other fields requiring emotional intelligence and understanding. While implementing FACS requires substantial investment due to its sophisticated software and hardware requirements, its potential benefits for educational outcomes are considerable. The system represents a major breakthrough that could transform teaching methodologies and enhance student learning experiences across multiple disciplines.\n\nThe integration of FACS into educational settings marks an important step forward in personalizing instruction and improving teacher-student communication. Despite its high implementation costs, this technology promises to revolutionize how we understand and respond to emotional cues in educational and professional environments.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Case Against Driverless Cars\n\nI firmly oppose the implementation of driverless cars. While some human drivers already pose risks on the road, I believe automated systems wouldn't necessarily improve safety. Rather than embracing this technology out of convenience, people should maintain responsibility for their own transportation.\n\nOne significant concern is that these vehicles aren't truly autonomous. They still require human intervention in certain situations, creating a dangerous gray area of responsibility. If the system fails to alert the driver in time for manual override, the consequences could be catastrophic. Moreover, this technology might enable impaired individuals to attempt driving under the misguided assumption that the car's autonomous features will ensure their safety. A driver too intoxicated to respond to emergency takeover requests poses a severe safety risk.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities present another critical issue. These computer-dependent vehicles could be susceptible to cyber attacks. Currently, skilled hackers can already breach smart vehicles' systems, remotely unlocking and starting cars without physical keys. With fully autonomous vehicles, the risks multiply exponentially. Malicious actors could potentially redirect vehicles, force collisions, or disable driver alerts\u2014leaving uncertainty about whether to blame the driver, the vehicle, or the system itself.\n\nFurthermore, this technology could exacerbate society's growing dependence on automation. We're already seeing the negative effects of excessive reliance on technology, as portrayed in films like \"WALL-E,\" where humans become increasingly sedentary and disconnected from active participation in their lives. Driverless cars represent another step toward this concerning future.\n\nDespite ongoing technological advances and improvements in autonomous vehicle systems, I believe their potential drawbacks outweigh their benefits.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text, enhancing its logical flow and coherence:\n\n**The Evolution of Technology in Our Lives**\n\nTechnology has become an integral part of human existence, developing at an unprecedented pace. From the evolution of television to pocket-sized computers, we have witnessed remarkable technological advancement that mirrors our own progress as a society.\n\nToday, life without technology would be challenging and inefficient. It has transformed every aspect of our daily routines, from solving problems on our phones to accessing instant information on the web. In education alone, we've progressed from chalkboards to interactive projectors, revolutionizing how we teach and learn.\n\nHowever, some technological developments raise important questions about their practical value. Consider the recent innovation in emotion-detection technology in classrooms. While it claims to help teachers read students' facial expressions and emotional states, I question its necessity and effectiveness. Teachers and staff members should already be capable of recognizing basic emotional cues, such as the tightening of the orbicularis muscles around students' lips, indicating happiness or displeasure.\n\nThe fundamental reality of school life remains unchanged: students typically don't enjoy assignments or coursework, regardless of emotional monitoring. Implementing emotion-detection technology won't alter the fact that students must complete their work and pass their classes.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# The Future of Autonomous Vehicles\n\nDriverless cars represent the next frontier in transportation technology. While they offer numerous advantages, they also present certain challenges that need to be carefully considered.\n\nOn the economic front, autonomous vehicles may disrupt traditional transportation services like taxis. However, this disruption could create new employment opportunities in specialized mechanics and service technicians for these sophisticated vehicles.\n\nThe benefits of self-driving cars are compelling. They promise to transform long-distance travel, making it less stressful while improving fuel efficiency. Their advanced computer systems can process information and react to dangers far more quickly than human drivers, potentially reducing accident rates significantly.\n\nIt's important to note that current autonomous vehicles aren't completely driverless. They still require human intervention in challenging situations, such as navigating complex driveways or managing unexpected road conditions. These vehicles incorporate sophisticated safety features, including driver monitoring systems that ensure operators remain alert when manual control is necessary. The system can even pause entertainment features when driver attention is required.\n\nThe primary obstacle to widespread adoption isn't technological but regulatory. While many states currently restrict self-driving cars on public roads, this is likely to change as the technology proves its reliability and safety record. Tesla and other manufacturers continue to demonstrate the safety potential of autonomous vehicles, though public trust remains a crucial factor in their acceptance.\n\nLooking ahead to the near future, we can expect to see autonomous vehicles become increasingly common. As public confidence grows and regulatory frameworks evolve, professional drivers may transition into more specialized roles, while autonomous operation becomes the norm for everyday transportation.\n\nHowever, the prediction that by 2020 ordinary people would no longer drive proved premature. This reminds us that while technological progress is inevitable, its timeline and social impact often unfold differently than anticipated.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The \"Face on Mars\": Debunking the Alien Theory\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" was definitively not created by aliens. There is compelling evidence that disproves any extraterrestrial origin theories.\n\nFirst, scientists demonstrated that the face-like appearance was merely an illusion created by shadows. As noted in scientific literature, \"Scientists determined it was just another Martian mesa, common in the Cydonia region, with unusual shadows that created a resemblance to an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" This conclusion comes from leading space scientists\u2014experts in a highly specialized field\u2014effectively dismissing any conspiracy theories.\n\nIn 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor captured high-resolution images that provided conclusive evidence. These new photographs, with pixels just 1.56 meters wide (compared to the Viking photos' 43-meter resolution), revealed the formation to be a typical Martian mesa, similar to geological formations found in the American Southwest. The supposed \"face\" was nothing more than a natural rock formation.\n\nMoreover, if alien artifacts had been discovered on Mars, it would have revolutionized space exploration. The resulting surge in funding would have undoubtedly accelerated human missions to Mars. The fact that we haven't prioritized manned Mars missions further supports the conclusion that the formation is simply a natural geological feature.\n\nIn conclusion, multiple lines of evidence confirm that the \"Face on Mars\" is nothing more than a mesa shaped by natural processes:\n- Scientific analysis of shadow patterns\n- High-resolution imagery from 2001\n- The absence of accelerated Mars exploration programs\n\nThis case exemplifies how improved technology and scientific investigation can help dispel misconceptions about seemingly mysterious phenomena.",
        "Driverless cars are a waste of time, money, and safety, and they should not be invented. Here are the reasons why they are not a good idea.\n\nFirst and foremost, driverless cars should not be used due to potential technology failures. If the technology fails and someone gets hurt, the company would be easily blamed, leading to significant legal and financial repercussions. Moreover, the cost of constantly upgrading and fixing the car, should it malfunction, can be burdensome for both the company and the individual. This is a significant reason why driverless cars should not be invented.\n\nDriverless cars also pose a major safety issue. While they could potentially reduce the number of drunk driving and texting while driving incidents, there are already laws in place to address these issues. Instead, there should be more focus on safety technology that protects the individual, rather than technology that drives the car. Additionally, the performance of driverless cars in adverse weather conditions, such as icy roads and floods, raises concerns. How will the car protect us from crashing or getting stuck in such scenarios? This is another reason driverless cars should not be used.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of a driverless car is not as straightforward as it seems.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a technology developed by Professor Thomas Huang, has the potential to revolutionize classroom learning and student support.  While researchers have long studied facial expressions, FACS utilizes advanced facial recognition to detect and interpret emotions.  This has far-reaching implications beyond the laboratory, particularly in educational settings.\n\nOne key benefit of FACS lies in its ability to personalize learning.  As Dr. Huang notes, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\u2026 Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"  Currently, teachers, while bound by curriculum and time constraints, strive to address individual student needs within a classroom of fifteen to twenty students.  FACS could provide the individualized support that is often challenging for teachers to deliver consistently. By recognizing student frustration or confusion through facial cues, the system could dynamically adjust lesson pacing and complexity, ensuring that students grasp the concepts effectively. This responsiveness could prevent students from feeling overwhelmed and disengaged, ultimately fostering a more positive and productive learning environment.\n\nFurthermore, FACS could prove invaluable for school counselors. Students often struggle to articulate their emotions, especially in a counseling setting where they may feel nervous or hesitant.  FACS could provide counselors with real-time insights into a student's emotional state, even if the student is not verbally expressing those feelings.  This technology could help counselors quickly identify underlying issues such as sadness, anxiety, or fear, allowing for more targeted and effective interventions. By facilitating a deeper understanding of student needs, FACS could significantly enhance the role of counselors in supporting student well-being.\n\nFACS could also bridge communication gaps between teachers and students, particularly those who are less verbally expressive or have communication challenges.  As Dr. Huang points out, \"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.\"",
        "Can Computers Read Your Emotions?\n\nIn the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author discusses how the Facial Action Coding System can decipher emotions and its potential application in classrooms. However, implementing this technology in educational settings may not be advantageous due to its high cost, potential for distracting students, privacy concerns, and risk of hindering effective learning.\n\nThe author mentions in paragraph 7 that \"Your home PC cannot handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile.\" Considering that typical home computers are priced between $200 and $500 USD, schools would need to invest in higher-end computers capable of running these sophisticated algorithms for each student. This expenditure becomes significant as every student would require access to such advanced hardware and software throughout their school day.\n\nFurthermore, paragraph 6 suggests that a classroom computer could identify when a student is bored or confused during a lesson and adapt accordingly. Yet, not every student will find every lesson engaging, leading to potentially misleading emotional cues triggering constant modifications by the program. This continual adjustment might veer lessons off course from their original objectives if they focus excessively on catering to individual emotions rather than teaching core content effectively.\n\nMoreover, constant monitoring of students' emotions by a computer infringes upon their privacy rights. The program's ability to detect boredom or confusion mandates informing teachers so they can adjust lessons accordingly based on each student's emotional state. This intrusion disregards individuals' desires for confidentiality regarding personal feelings, which may impact how freely students express themselves within an academic environment.\n\nConsequently, tailoring lessons based on students' emotions may deviate from educators' intended curricular outcomes. For instance, if the goal is understanding mitochondrial functions within cells but a bored expression prompts continuous modification of the lesson with attention-diverting tactics, it compromises comprehensive learning attainment envisioned by teachers initially.\n\nAlthough Facial Action Coding Systems offer remarkable utility in scientific contexts, practical challenges arise when integrating this technology into classrooms due to associated costs burdensome purchases for schools,, heightened distractions for learners,, privacy infringement concerns,,, and altered learning experiences straying from instructional intents,,,,,.",
        "The allure of driverless cars has captured the media's attention, with companies like Google developing autonomous driving capabilities since 2009.  However, the fundamental safety concerns surrounding these vehicles remain paramount.  Rather than enhancing safety, driverless cars pose a significant hazard to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians alike.\n\nThe core issue lies in the potential for distraction.  Even semi-autonomous systems, like Google's, require driver intervention in specific situations such as navigating driveways, construction zones, traffic, and accidents.  These alerts, ironically, can create distractions, diverting the driver's attention from the road and increasing the risk of accidents.  Features like BMW's \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" while designed for low-speed driving, still require hands-on monitoring, highlighting the inherent limitations of these systems and the continued need for driver vigilance.  The possibility of a driver falling asleep while relying on such a system, especially at higher speeds, raises serious safety concerns and potential legal ramifications for both drivers and manufacturers.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of in-car entertainment systems with heads-up displays, while potentially engaging, exacerbates the distraction problem. Even with the ability to disable these displays while driving, the temptation to engage with them remains, diverting attention from the road and increasing accident risk.\n\nCurrent traffic laws underscore the importance of a constantly alert driver for the safety of all road users.  Introducing driverless technology undermines this fundamental principle.  In the event of a system failure, the question of liability\u2014driver or manufacturer\u2014becomes a complex legal battleground.  Automakers' optimistic projections about resolving these technological challenges in the near future do not negate the immediate dangers posed by driverless cars.\n\nWith traffic accidents already a significant problem, introducing driverless vehicles onto our roads is a gamble with public safety. The only truly safe vehicle is one operated by a fully attentive driver.  Until driverless technology can guarantee a level of safety equivalent to, or surpassing, that of a human driver, it should not be allowed on public roads.",
        "Driverless cars hold immense promise for enhancing road safety by preventing accidents caused by human errors such as texting while driving or hit-and-runs. With advanced sensors that detect and modify the car's actions when approaching objects, these vehicles offer protection not only to their passengers but also to other drivers on the road. Key technologies such as LIDAR use laser beams to create an ever-updating 3-D model of the surroundings, allowing driverless cars to emulate the decision-making capabilities of a skilled human driver. Additionally, Google\u2019s GPS technology integrates with Google Maps, helping these vehicles navigate effectively to their destinations.\n\nA vital component of this technology is \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" which enables cars to manage driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. This system includes touch sensors that ensure drivers maintain contact with the wheel for safety. Although current models cannot operate entirely without human intervention\u2014they can brake, steer, and accelerate autonomously\u2014driver input is still crucial for navigating complex situations like work zones or unexpected accidents.\n\nDespite advancements in autonomous technology, human oversight remains essential. Drivers must remain attentive and ready to take control when needed. GM has developed a system where vehicle seats vibrate if there is danger or when backing up towards an object; this alerts drivers who need to intervene. The vehicle also communicates alternative routes in challenging situations where human judgment becomes necessary.\n\nTo enhance driver attention further, cameras monitor whether drivers are focused on the road while ensuring their awareness through various alerts and signals. Automakers continue innovating ways to ensure both safety and engagement on the road.\n\nManufacturers are optimistic about future developments in autonomous vehicles; they anticipate that by 2020\u2014or soon thereafter\u2014cars will be able to operate on autopilot 90% of the time. Continuous technological innovation promises even more advancements in automobile safety features over successive decades.",

        "Imagine driving past a car with no driver. The concept of driverless cars is indeed intriguing. However, after reading the article, it is clear that despite some appealing features, driverless cars should not be integrated into our daily lives any time soon.\n\nThe article highlights several drawbacks of driverless cars, including the need for new traffic laws, the potential for accidents, and concerns about the safety of pedestrians and other drivers. Currently, traffic laws assume that a car is only safe if a human driver is in control, making it illegal in most states to test cars operated by computers.\n\nThe safety of driverless cars is also a major concern. Although, as the article notes, these cars are equipped with numerous cameras and sensors, the technology is not yet perfected. The possibility of sensor or camera failure is a significant risk, which could lead to accidents. Such failures compromise the safety of other drivers and pedestrians. Additionally, if a driverless car is involved in an accident, the question of liability arises. New laws would need to be established, solely to accommodate driverless cars, while the alternative of driving our cars remains a viable, less complicated option.\n\nAnother downside of driverless cars is the potential loss of jobs. Driving services, which currently rely on human drivers, would no longer need them, leading to unemployment for thousands. This, in turn, would increase the unemployment rate, forcing the government to provide more financial support, as affected families would lose a source of income, a direct consequence of driverless cars replacing human drivers.\n\nIn conclusion, driverless cars, while a fascinating concept, seem to generate more issues than they resolve.",

        "I am in favor of advancing towards driverless cars for several reasons. Once the technology is perfected, roads will become safer, transportation costs will decrease, and travel on roads could become faster.\n\nThe concept of driverless cars is remarkable, and when perfected, it will create new opportunities for road transportation. These cars will have the ability to detect vehicles that a human driver might miss, reducing the number of accidents significantly.\n\nSome states have already permitted computer-driven cars on the road, indicating the increasing safety of driverless vehicles. Manufacturers anticipate that more states will authorize the use of driverless cars as they continue to enhance safety and affordability.\n\nAnother benefit of driverless cars is the potential for more economical transportation. For instance, Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, predicts that the fuel consumption of these cars will be half of the current rate, reducing environmental impact. Brin also suggests that driverless taxis will offer greater safety and flexibility, minimizing the risk of hazardous driver behavior.\n\nMoreover, driverless cars could facilitate quicker travel between destinations. These autonomous vehicles have the capability to travel at speeds higher than the current highway limits, while maintaining safety through advanced sensors, making the roads safer.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of driverless cars is an ongoing process, and further research is needed to perfect the technology for road use. However, the evolution of driverless cars will transform the future of transportation, offering a safer, faster, and more cost-effective means of travel.",

Scientists have consistently identified it as a typical Martian mesa, a landform commonly found in the Cydonia region.\n\nWhile conspiracy theorists suggest NASA is concealing evidence of alien civilization, the reality is quite different. Ironically, NASA budget defenders would have welcomed discovering ancient civilizations on Mars, as such a finding would justify increased funding. However, few credible scientists ever considered the formation to be an artificial structure. When higher-resolution images were captured\u2014ten times sharper than the original\u2014they clearly revealed the natural characteristics of the formation.\n\nSome skeptics remained unconvinced, prompting NASA to take additional photographs using the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nI am a scientist at NASA, and over the years, we have discovered a peculiar formation on Mars that resembles a face. This feature was photographed by our spacecraft on three separate occasions: first in 1976, then in 1998, and finally in 2001. While the discovery of what appeared to be a face on Mars generated significant public interest, reactions were mixed.\n\nThe image sparked widespread speculation, with some suggesting it was created by extraterrestrial beings, while others maintained it was simply a natural landform. The phenomenon captured the public's imagination, inspiring movies, books, and magazine covers, and becoming a topic of discussion on various talk shows.\n\nHowever, as scientists, we believe this \"face\" is merely an illusion. Our analysis suggests it's just another Martian mesa, a geological formation commonly found in the Cydonia region. Subsequent high-resolution images clearly labeled it as a \"huge rock formation.\" The face that captivated so many people and fueled theories about alien architects is, in fact, a natural formation.",
        "Here's a logically restructured and improved version of the text:\n\n**Natural Formation vs. Alien Theory: Analyzing the Mars Mesa**\n\nThe discovery of an intriguing landform on Mars has sparked debate, with some believing it to be an alien signal. While its appearance might seem unusual at first glance, there's a more straightforward explanation.\n\nThis object is simply another natural formation in space. Despite its striking appearance\u2014resembling an Egyptian face\u2014it's merely a large rock formation known as a mesa. The perceived facial features are created by the interplay of sunlight and shadows on the rock's surface, nothing more.\n\nSimilar phenomena occur frequently on Earth. People often claim to see faces or familiar shapes in everyday objects\u2014like celebrities' profiles in food items\u2014a phenomenon known as pareidelia. As mentioned in passage 12, these optical illusions are common on our own planet.\n\nThe rarity of this formation actually argues against alien origin. According to passage 9, this particular structure was difficult to locate. If alien civilizations were responsible for constructing such features, we would expect to find many more examples, not just isolated instances.\n\nFurthermore, there is no concrete evidence supporting extraterrestrial construction. Scientific research has revealed this to be a mesa\u2014a natural geological formation. While initial observations may have seemed suspicious, thorough investigation has provided a clear geological explanation.\n\nThe need for empirical evidence is crucial in such cases.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System is quite puzzling to me. Why would anyone want to know what someone else is feeling or their emotional state? To me, that's personal information I'd prefer to keep private. Besides, I doubt there are many people willing to invest money just to discern their emotions. That's just my perspective, though. What do you think about this concept? Would you spend time and money simply to determine your emotions and current mood? I wouldn't.\n\nAs you continue reading, I'll explain why I believe this is a poor idea\u2014because it truly is. Who would dedicate time, effort, or money merely to identify their emotions or feelings? Honestly, who needs guidance on which facial expressions convey happiness when we already instinctively know how to express joy? We don't need a machine telling us how to look happy. When something wonderful occurs in someone's life and they feel happy, it's evident from the big smile on their face. Similarly, we recognize when someone is angry; they tend not to talk much and might appear as if they're ready for confrontation.\n\nFor instance, some texts provide step-by-step instructions on which facial expressions project happiness\u2014as if we don't already understand how our faces naturally reflect happiness or sadness or anger! We certainly don't need a machine for that.\n\nSo why rely on technology for insights into what we innately comprehend? Our world seems preoccupied with spending resources on unnecessary things and creating inventions that serve no real purpose today. There's literally no point in such inventions existing. Furthermore, strangers likely wouldn't appreciate us calculating their emotions at any given moment since these matters are deeply personal; we have no understanding of their life's context or experiences.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nStudents experience a wide range of emotions throughout the school day. While school can be stressful and overwhelming, it can also be engaging and enjoyable. These emotional states significantly impact students' ability to learn. By incorporating the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in the classroom, teachers\u2014or even computers themselves\u2014could adapt their teaching methods to customize learning experiences based on students' emotional states.\n\nLearning styles vary greatly among students. While some are visual learners, others may better process information through auditory means. These individual differences create challenges for teachers attempting to deliver uniform content to diverse groups of students. The Facial Action Coding System could ease this burden while enhancing student learning outcomes. For instance, if a teacher fails to notice that a student is fatigued, they might continue with their current teaching method, potentially leaving that student struggling to grasp the concept. With FACS, teachers could recognize these emotional cues and adjust their teaching approach to something more engaging for that particular student, helping them remain focused and receptive to learning.\n\nWhen FACS detects that students appear engaged and enthusiastic, it can validate the effectiveness of current teaching methods, encouraging teachers to maintain successful approaches. This technology could prove particularly valuable when students work on computers or other electronic devices. With FACS integrated into these learning devices, the system could automatically adjust content presentation to match each student's emotional state and learning needs. As Dr. Huang, a professor at Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, notes, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"\n\nThe implementation of the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms offers numerous benefits for both teachers and students. This technology would enable educators and electronic learning platforms to adapt their teaching methods to accommodate diverse learning styles.",

        "Here's the polished version:\n\nThe Face on Mars: Natural Formation vs Artificial Construction\n\nThe mysterious \"Face on Mars\" has sparked considerable debate since its discovery. While some believe it was created by extraterrestrial intelligence, I maintain that it is a natural geological formation.\n\nSeveral pieces of evidence support the natural formation theory. Scientists have identified similar landforms on Earth, suggesting common geological processes at work. More importantly, high-resolution photographs taken by NASA spacecraft reveal that the \"facial features\" are merely an illusion created by shadows falling across the Martian terrain. Despite extensive study, no concrete evidence of artificial construction has ever been found.\n\nThose who support the alien origin theory cite various arguments. They point to the face-like appearance in the original Viking 1 photographs and suggest that government agencies might be concealing information. The enduring human fascination with extraterrestrial life also fuels these beliefs, even in the absence of substantive evidence.\n\nHowever, technological advances have provided clarity. While the initial Viking 1 images from 1976 seemed to show a face-like structure, modern high-resolution imaging has revealed the true nature of the formation. Today's detailed photographs clearly demonstrate that the \"face\" is simply a natural mesa, shaped by millions of years of Martian geological processes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Face on Mars captured public imagination and spawned numerous theories, the evidence strongly suggests it is a natural formation rather than an alien artifact. This case demonstrates how improved technology can help distinguish between apparent mysteries and natural phenomena.",
        "Integrating Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology into schools offers valuable classroom insights. By detecting often subtle student cues, FACS can provide teachers with feedback on lesson effectiveness and student emotional well-being.  However, it's crucial to ensure this technology respects students' privacy and doesn't intrude on their personal feelings.  FACS can enhance teaching by providing in-depth analysis of student comprehension, reactions, and areas where teachers can adapt their approach for optimal learning outcomes.\n\nStudent expressions of fatigue or anticipation, particularly at the beginning or end of the school day, can sometimes be misinterpreted by teachers as disengagement with the lesson.  Integrating FACS into school computers allows for the tracking of students' emotional responses during online activities and assignments, providing insights into their attentiveness. By comparing facial expressions against a neutral baseline, teachers gain a clearer understanding of student reactions.  While tiredness or excitement can sometimes mask true engagement, FACS, using video imagery and analysis of characteristic facial muscle movements associated with six basic emotions, offers a more objective assessment of student responses to lessons.\n\nAnother valuable application of FACS lies in identifying student confusion or boredom, both indicators of a mismatch between task difficulty and student ability. While teachers strive to support struggling students and challenge those who are bored, these emotions are not always readily apparent.  Students, especially when confused, may hide their struggles to avoid embarrassment. FACS technology can detect subtle muscle movements indicative of these emotions, even when students attempt to conceal them.  This allows teachers to identify students requiring additional support or lesson modifications, tailoring instruction to individual needs and ensuring appropriate levels of challenge.\n\nFurthermore, FACS can play a role in addressing bullying and depression within schools. By recognizing signs of fear or sadness, the technology can provide early warning signs of potential problems.  Even attempts to mask these emotions, such as forced smiles, can be detected by the system.  This offers a valuable tool in a time when student mental health is a critical concern.  Consistent monitoring and reporting of these emotional cues can provide a crucial lifeline for students who might not otherwise seek help.\n\nWhile the benefits of FACS are significant, it's essential to implement safeguards to protect student privacy. With the increasing prevalence of take-home devices, clear boundaries must be established to ensure FACS data is used solely for educational purposes and does not infringe on students' personal lives.",

        "Have you seen the \"Face on Mars\"? If so, do you believe it is a natural formation or evidence of alien activity? While many people think the face is proof of extraterrestrial life, this is likely not the case. The Mars Global Surveyor, a mapping spacecraft, has passed over the area several times. However, these passes have revealed no evidence of alien civilization. This leads us to believe it is merely a natural landform.\n\nThe story began when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting Mars. Viking 1 was taking photos of potential landing sites for its sibling craft, Viking 2. During this mission, Viking 1 captured an image resembling a human face\u2014an extraordinary find on planet Mars! When these images were released to the public, many believed they were evidence of life beyond Earth.\n\nHowever, this might not be true. NASA suggests that the face is just a natural formation similar to buttes or mesas found on Earth. Despite considerable evidence supporting NASA's conclusion, public enthusiasm about extraterrestrial life remained high for some.\n\nThe initial pictures of the \"Face on Mars\" from NASA were quite unclear due to being taken through clouds by the Mars Global Surveyor. This led some people to suspect that NASA was hiding something in the fog\u2014possibly evidence of alien life\u2014though NASA aimed to dispel such theories.\n\nA few years later, during a cloudless summer day in Cydonia region where this feature lies\u200b ,\u200bNASA passed over and adjusted their spacecraft's position by 25 degrees to perfectly center its viewfinder\u200b\u200b\u200b.

As humans, we naturally perform emotional recognition every day, instinctively understanding whether our friends are happy or sad through their facial expressions. Research has shown that certain facial expressions for basic emotions are universal across cultures. Furthermore, the capabilities of computers in this field are still expanding, with systems becoming increasingly adept at detecting emotional states.\n\nWhile we might struggle to precisely describe the specific facial traits that indicate happiness or worry, our understanding of human anatomy helps us recognize these emotions. Modern computer software now incorporates this anatomical knowledge into its programming. New emotion-recognition software can track facial movements in both real-time video and static images, such as the Mona Lisa. These systems can even detect complex, mixed emotions by analyzing different facial components simultaneously.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly support this technological advancement, particularly as computers become more integrated into our daily lives. The combination of video analysis capabilities, the expanding potential of computer systems, and our innate ability to recognize emotions makes a compelling case for this technology.",

        "The face is just a natural landform described as a \"huge rock formation\" in the story. Whether real or fake, it aimed to bring Mars into the public eye, which it successfully achieved. Had those final photos not been captured, the fate of this research project would remain unknown.\n\nIn the story, NASA posited that the face likely resulted from shadows on a large rock formation, creating an illusion of facial features. While some still question this explanation and propose alien involvement, NASA's expertise and firsthand observations suggest otherwise. Aliens are unlikely to create such structures openly on Mars.\n\nThe effort to draw attention to Mars through discussions in various media outlets proved effective. Hollywood films, magazines, talk shows, and everyday conversations boosted Mars' profile significantly for 25 years post-discovery. This increased publicity ensured that people worldwide engaged more with discussions surrounding Mars.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of Viking missions and reduced public interest in the face on Mars, NASA revisited it for closer inspection through enhanced photography efforts. By capturing clearer images during less cloudy months and sharing sharper pictures in 1998 via web platforms like JPL's site drawing large audiences eager to view them revealed its true identity as a natural landform devoid of alien origins.\n\nUltimately, despite initial speculation about alien involvement around the Martian face formation by some individuals - confirmed by NASA's later observations - initiating public discourse about Mars was beneficial overall.

        "Let me help restructure this text to improve its flow, clarity, and coherence while correcting grammatical errors and typos. Here's the revised version:\n\n# The Role of Facial Recognition Technology in Modern Classrooms\n\nThe integration of new technology in classrooms has sparked considerable debate in educational circles. While some advocate for incorporating innovative tools like facial recognition technology, others question its necessity in the learning environment. Author Nick D'Alto presents compelling arguments for how facial recognition technology could enhance the educational experience.\n\n## Benefits for Student Learning\n\nOne significant advantage of facial recognition technology is its ability to detect student engagement and comprehension in real-time. As Dr. Huang explains, \"A classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" For instance, when students work on online mathematics or English assignments, the system could identify confusion and provide targeted, step-by-step instructions. Teachers could also access this data to identify common areas of difficulty and provide more detailed explanations during class.\n\n## Applications in Specialized Education\n\nThe technology offers particular benefits for students interested in coding and computer animation. As noted in the research, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive\u2014for video games or video surgery.\" This capability provides valuable learning opportunities for students in computer animation classes who aspire to become programmers or animators. The technology helps them understand how to create more detailed and expressive digital characters, providing essential knowledge for their future careers.\n\n## Addressing Concerns\n\nWhile critics argue that teachers can adequately read their students' facial expressions without technological assistance, they may overlook subtle cues or mixed emotions that the technology can detect. Facial recognition systems can track minute facial movements and identify complex emotional states that might not be immediately apparent to human observers.",

He advocates for expanding horizons beyond conventional boundaries while maintaining reverence for both nature\u2019s wonders and dangers alike.\n\nIn conclusion, studying celestial bodies plays a crucial role in comprehending our surroundings better.",
        "The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He notes that Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky and is one of the planets in our solar system with the highest surface temperatures, reaching 800 degrees Fahrenheit. This is remarkably high, even though Mercury is closer to the sun but does not reach Venus's temperatures.\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on Venus is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on our planet. Such an environment would crush even a submarine designed to dive to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\n\nStudying Venus is challenging due to numerous obstacles. Venusian geology and weather present additional challenges, such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes, which complicate the efforts of probes trying to land on its surface. These factors, including the extreme conditions, weather, temperatures, and pressure, make the study of Venus's surface difficult.\n\nMoreover, the dense atmosphere prevents light from penetrating, and, most importantly, researchers cannot collect samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. However, NASA is exploring alternative approaches to studying Venus, including a project that is revisiting the concept of mechanical computers, a technology first envisioned in the 1800s, which played a crucial role during the 1940s, in World War II.",
        "I personally believe that the Facial Action Coding System, a computer program capable of identifying human emotions, would have no practical value in a classroom setting. While it may have potential applications in other fields such as the entertainment industry, scientific studies, and crime-solving, its use within an educational environment is questionable.\n\nOne major concern with implementing this technology in classrooms is the invasion of privacy it poses to students. Being monitored and scanned for emotions on a daily basis could make students feel exposed and uncomfortable. Some individuals may not want their emotional states to be recognized due to personal reasons or fear of unwanted conflicts arising from others knowing how they feel.\n\nMoreover, teachers are tasked with ensuring that students understand and absorb the material regardless of their emotional state. While recognizing students' emotions could provide insight into why they might be disinterested in the material, it does not change the fact that learning must still take place for academic progress to occur. Therefore, this technology would serve little purpose for both students and teachers within a classroom setting.\n\nFurthermore, using emotion identification technology in classrooms raises ethical concerns about student privacy rights being violated. The idea of having one's emotions constantly monitored without consent could create an atmosphere of distrust and discomfort among students.\n\nIn contrast, there are various beneficial uses for this technology outside of the classroom context. For instance, it could aid researchers in understanding historical artistic techniques by analyzing expressions like those found on the Mona Lisa. Additionally, industries such as entertainment could benefit from more accurate CGI development based on emotion recognition technology.\n\nIn conclusion, while emotion identification technology has potential applications beyond academia, its implementation within classrooms may do more harm than good by infringing upon student privacy and potentially hindering learning processes rather than enhancing them.",

        "Driverless cars have become a significant development in recent years, sparking controversy over their necessity and feasibility. Some argue that driverless cars are not truly autonomous yet as they still require a driver for certain functions. However, I firmly believe that driverless cars are a beneficial concept, and here is why.\n\nOne of the key advantages of driverless cars is their ability to significantly reduce fuel consumption by almost half, which has positive implications on multiple levels. Gas emissions contribute to pollution, particularly with the increasing number of motorists on the roads today. These emissions harm the ozone layer crucial for maintaining air quality. Therefore, any opportunity to decrease gas consumption through driverless technology is highly beneficial not only for environmental reasons but also for lowering fuel costs.\n\nMoreover, as gas prices continue to rise over time, drivers experience financial strain due to this ongoing expense. By transitioning to driverless cars that require less fuel, individuals can save money that would otherwise be spent on gasoline.\n\nIn terms of functionality, driverless cars serve more as assistants rather than fully independent operators. This feature can relieve pressure on drivers\u2014especially new ones\u2014by taking over certain tasks such as steering and braking while alerting them when human intervention is necessary.\n\nSafety remains a top priority for companies developing these vehicles, ensuring consumer satisfaction with advanced safety features designed to prevent accidents or collisions effectively.\n\nAnother aspect worth considering is entertainment within these vehicles. Despite concerns about potential boredom from not actively driving while inside a car, manufacturers have focused on incorporating various entertainment systems like heads-up displays to enhance passengers' experiences during travel.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that embracing driverless car technology offers numerous benefits: reduced pollution levels; cost savings through lower gas consumption; alleviation of stress on new drivers; improved safety features; and enhanced in-car entertainment options. While there may be further enhancements needed before achieving complete autonomy in vehicles, embracing this innovative technology signals an essential step towards progress in transportation solutions.I sincerely believe that widespread adoption of drivereleess card will bring positive changes adn improvements nd encourage youo do research further into this impactful innovation.",
        "In the article about the Mona Lisa's smile, a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is discussed. This technology analyzes the Mona Lisa's smile using computer software to determine the percentage of each emotion she is expressing. According to the article, FACS can provide detailed insights into a person's emotions. As mentioned in paragraph 6, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" I believe this is a smart innovation, as it can reveal when a person is sad even if they have a smile on their face, indicating their true feelings at a given moment.\n\nHumans express the same emotions daily, whether they are happy or sad. The article states that there are \"44 muscles, just like human muscles,\" that can convey emotions and the intensity of those emotions. Sometimes, the system compares a face to a neutral one to highlight the differences.",
        "Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, even when you are trying to hide your emotions.  New software, called the Facial Action Coding System, has been developed to identify the emotions of others and is poised for use across various industries.  Using video imagery, this emotion-recognition software tracks subtle facial movements, interpreting expressions that you might miss.  As the article explains, \"in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways.\"  While you might not be able to discern a friend's true feelings simply by looking at their face, this software can.\n\nThe potential of this technology in the classroom is particularly exciting.  Imagine a classroom computer that could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused. As Dr. Huang predicts, \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This ability to read the emotional expressions of students is invaluable. It could revolutionize teaching by allowing for real-time lesson adjustments, ultimately enhancing students' learning experience.

        "Driverless cars are often envisioned as a hallmark of the future, expected to dominate our roads in the next twenty years. However, technology is not advancing as rapidly as we might think, and there are numerous challenges and concerns associated with these vehicles.\n\nWhen people imagine driverless cars, they envision a futuristic world finally becoming reality. Yet, as mentioned in several articles, these cars could malfunction and legally implicate manufacturers rather than drivers. Accidents are just one aspect; drivers would still need to be cautious and remain aware of their surroundings. Every time individuals enter their driverless vehicle, they must acknowledge the risks involved.\n\nOne significant concern is that driverless cars have a feature designed to alert humans when they need to take over control. However, this feature may not be as reliable or safe as believed. If the car fails to alert the person swiftly enough\u2014especially on fast-moving highways\u2014serious problems could arise for all those using such vehicles. The current technology struggles with recognizing traffic stops or work zones effectively, requiring drivers to intervene temporarily.\n\nFurthermore, questions have been raised about whether a driver might become bored with their car being autonomous. Initially exciting, this novelty could fade over time since users aren't actively engaged in driving tasks. Although sensors require hands-on-the-wheel interaction at all times for safety reasons, this stipulation seems contradictory to calling them \"driverless.\" Manufacturers must also address potential mishaps like falling asleep behind the wheel due to inactivity.\n\nIn conclusion, while incorporating advanced features into vehicles sounds appealing for those seeking futuristic enhancements in their transportation methods\u2014as discussed throughout this reflection\u2014the concept of driverless cars presents multiple disadvantages and concerns that must be thoroughly considered before widespread adoption becomes viable.",
        "For many people, including myself, there are days when we feel happy, optimistic, and generally in a good mood for no particular reason. Conversely, there are days when we feel sad, pessimistic, and overall just in a bad mood. \n\nThe passage explores the potential of technology to read and interpret human emotions, using a variety of examples and expert insights. In paragraph one, the passage introduces the Mona Lisa, noting that the technology has assessed her expression as 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This example illustrates the potential of emotion-reading technology, although it raises questions, which the passage aims to address. \n\nParagraph three provides background information, explaining how the emotions of the girl in the painting were determined. The author discusses the main emotions humans display, and the technology's ability to mimic the facial muscles and movements, which are essential in expressing these emotions.",
        "Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a new technology designed to identify emotions. Developed by Dr. Paul Ekman, FACS classifies six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.  Each emotion is associated with characteristic facial muscle movements.\n\nThis technology is now being implemented in schools. A classroom computer equipped with FACS could recognize when a student is confused or bored, then modify the lesson, much like an effective human instructor.  This application seems promising for students who are hesitant to communicate with their teachers.  However, there are potential downsides.\n\nOne concern is the possibility of the computer misinterpreting a student's facial expressions, leading to the delivery of incorrect or irrelevant information.  The cost of implementing such technology is also a significant factor.  Perhaps the most serious concern is the potential displacement of teachers.  If a computer can effectively instruct students, the need for human educators might be questioned, leading to job losses for those who have dedicated their careers to teaching.\n\nOn the positive side, FACS could enhance learning, particularly for students who are withdrawn or quiet in class.  These students might benefit from a computer's ability to personalize instruction based on their emotional responses.  Just as online advertising algorithms adapt to user reactions \u2013 displaying similar ads after a smile, and different ones after a frown \u2013 FACS could tailor lessons to a student's emotional state. This allows for a real-time understanding of the student's feelings.\n\nUltimately, FACS presents both advantages and disadvantages.  While the long-term benefits might include improved learning outcomes and potentially more intelligent students, the short-term consequences could be disruptive. Students might become less socially adept due to decreased interaction with teachers, and educators could face unemployment.  Balancing the potential educational gains with the societal impact on teachers will be crucial as this technology develops.",
        "There are many people who enjoy driving for various reasons, such as fun, family bonding, or socializing with friends. However, some companies are considering the development of driverless cars to eliminate the need for manual driving. In this essay, I will argue against the production of driverless cars and explain why they should not be allowed on the roads.\n\nThe first reason against driverless cars is that obesity and laziness are already significant issues in America. With sedentary lifestyles contributing to health problems, having driverless cars could worsen this situation by reducing physical activity even further. Driving involves physical movements like walking to the car, steering, and getting in and out of the vehicle \u2013 all forms of exercise that would be eliminated with autonomous vehicles.\n\nAnother concern is the safety aspect of driverless cars. If a technical malfunction occurs while a self-driving car is on the road among human-operated vehicles, it could lead to severe accidents or injuries. The question of liability in such cases remains unanswered \u2013 whether fault lies with the manufacturer or user adds another layer of complexity to this issue.\n\nFurthermore, existing laws prioritize safety by emphasizing alert and responsible driving practices. Introducing autonomous vehicles into this regulatory framework could pose challenges as they may not align with current legal standards aimed at protecting drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Lawmakers must consider how allowing driverless cars might compromise public safety on our roads.\n\nIn conclusion, due to concerns regarding escalating obesity rates in America, safety implications associated with potential malfunctions in autonomous technology during road use, and conflicts with existing laws focused on alert driving practices for public safety; I firmly believe that driverless cars should not be manufactured or permitted on our streets at present.",
        "The author presents various challenges associated with studying Venus in the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus.\" Despite these obstacles, the author argues that researchers should make an effort to study this planet due to several compelling reasons. These reasons include highlighting the similarities between Venus and Earth, proposing solutions for inhabiting Venus, and emphasizing how research on Venus could advance human knowledge.\n\nOne way the author supports their argument is by suggesting that Venus may have had conditions similar to Earth in the past. The text mentions that long ago, Venus might have been covered with oceans and supported life forms akin to those found on Earth. This notion is reinforced by descriptions of familiar geological features such as valleys, mountains, and craters on Venus. Furthermore, considering Venus as a potential destination for planetary exploration is advantageous given the vast distances involved in space travel.\n\nAdditionally, the author offers potential solutions for conducting research on Venus despite its hostile environment. For instance, NASA's proposal to utilize floating vehicles above the planet's surface could provide scientists with a safe means of observation. By highlighting factors like manageable air pressure levels and ample solar power availability at higher altitudes on Venus, the author underscores how practical strategies can be employed to study this intriguing planet.\n\nFinally, the author underscores how overcoming the challenges associated with exploring Venus would not only enhance our understanding of this celestial body but also stimulate human curiosity and innovation.

        "Here's my polished version of the text:\n\n# The Promise of Driverless Cars\n\nIn the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author examines both the advantages and potential drawbacks of autonomous vehicles. The piece explores their capabilities while acknowledging certain limitations inherent in this emerging technology.\n\nI support the development of driverless cars because they enhance human safety by providing additional layers of protection against potential accidents. As noted in the article, \"The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\" These autonomous systems often prove more reliable than human reflexes in preventing collisions and protecting vehicle occupants.\n\nCurrently, driverless cars can handle various driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. They're intelligently designed to alert drivers when human intervention is necessary, such as during road construction or accidents. The article states, \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills... navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" This technology represents a significant advancement in automotive safety.\n\nThe evolution of autonomous vehicles has been steady and promising. Even in 2016, we saw cars equipped with features like automatic braking systems and safety-linked entertainment controls.

While individual opinions vary, the potential benefits of this technology are compelling.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages is enhanced safety.  As the article highlights, these cars have already driven over half a million miles without incident. This impressive track record suggests that driverless technology could drastically reduce the number of car crashes each year.  Furthermore, the car itself is designed with safety as a priority. Equipped with sensors that \"sense the world\" around them, these vehicles can react faster and more efficiently than a human driver.  These sensors, which the article notes are not a new technology, allow the car to independently apply brakes to individual wheels and reduce engine power, responding to potential hazards with a precision unmatched by human capability. This protects not only the driver but also the vehicle itself.  The built-in safety mechanisms, such as the touch sensors that ensure driver engagement when necessary, further mitigate risk.  The alert system reminds drivers when they need to take control, adding another layer of security.\n\nWhile some may harbor concerns about unforeseen issues, the potential positive impact outweighs the hypothetical negatives.  The desire for safer vehicles is widespread, and driverless technology directly addresses this need.  Specifically, this technology offers a solution to the pervasive problem of distracted driving, particularly texting while driving.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe driverless cars represent a significant advancement.",
        "The \"Face on Mars,\" a peculiar landform captured in images by the Mars Global Surveyor in 1976, sparked considerable speculation.  While some believed it to be evidence of extraterrestrial construction, scientific analysis reveals a more natural explanation.  The initial image, with its low resolution of 43 meters per pixel, contributed to the illusion of a face.  Subsequent images taken in 1998, and particularly in 2001 with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel, progressively clarified the landform's true nature. The improved clarity of the 2001 image revealed a rounded, smooth, natural mesa, debunking the artificiality suggested by the earlier, blurrier photographs.\n\nThe location of this mesa within the Cydonian region of Mars is also significant.  Cydonia is known for its abundance of mesas, and, as scientists quickly pointed out, the \"Face\" is just another example, albeit one with unusual shadowing that initially created a resemblance to an Egyptian Pharaoh.  This explanation, widely disseminated through the internet, helped to quell the initial excitement surrounding the image.  The 1998 image, taken during a cloudy period on Mars, likely further obscured the mesa's true form, contributing to the ongoing mystery.\n\nDespite scientific consensus classifying the \"Face\" as a natural landform, some still maintain the possibility of alien construction. However, the progression of images, from the blurry 1976 photo to the clear 2001 image, provides compelling visual evidence of its natural origin.  Therefore, the \"Face on Mars\" stands as a testament to the power of image resolution and the importance of scientific scrutiny, demonstrating how initial perceptions can be transformed with improved data and wider dissemination of information.  While it may remain a subject of fascination, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the \"Face on Mars\" is a natural geological formation, shaped by the forces of nature rather than by alien hands.",

        "Here's my polished version of the text:\n\n# The Double-Edged Sword of Emotional Recognition Technology in Education\n\nThe Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, captivates viewers with its subtle blend of emotions. This human ability to perceive and interpret emotions raises an intriguing question: Can computer programs effectively analyze human feelings? Like many technological advances, emotional recognition software in educational settings presents both opportunities and challenges.\n\n## The Human Connection Dilemma\n\nStudents' emotional states naturally fluctuate throughout their academic journey. While technology might offer precise emotional detection, it risks diminishing essential human interactions. If students and teachers rely too heavily on automated emotional analysis, they may lose opportunities to develop natural emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills. Additionally, teachers might become overly concerned about negative emotional readings, potentially leading to unnecessary interventions.\n\n## Potential Benefits for Learning\n\nEmotional recognition technology could enhance the educational experience in meaningful ways. When students display confusion or disengagement, the system could alert teachers to adjust their teaching methods accordingly. As noted in research, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This technology could also help identify students struggling with mental health challenges, enabling timely intervention from counselors.\n\n## Technical and Ethical Considerations\n\nSeveral practical challenges emerge when implementing emotional recognition systems:\n\n- Software reliability and security vulnerabilities\n- Variations in facial structure and expression across different individuals\n- The risk of misinterpreting natural facial differences or physical conditions\n- The potential erosion of students' emotional intelligence skills\n\n## The Adolescent Factor\n\nThe complexity increases when considering adolescent students experiencing puberty. During this period of significant hormonal changes and emotional volatility, the technology might struggle to interpret typical teenage mood swings accurately. This could lead to false alarms or unnecessary concern from educators.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile emotional recognition technology offers potential benefits for educational environments, its implementation requires careful consideration. The technology's impact on students' social development, privacy concerns, and the natural complexity of human emotions all warrant thorough discussion. Rather than rushing to adopt such systems, educational institutions should engage in comprehensive dialogue about their necessity and potential consequences.\n\nPersonal privacy and emotional authenticity remain paramount concerns. If students feel monitored, they might suppress their natural emotional expressions, potentially hindering their social and emotional development. Before implementing such technology in schools, we must carefully weigh these considerations against potential benefits through thoughtful, inclusive discussion with all stakeholders.",
        "Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology can analyze facial expressions to determine emotions like happiness or sadness.  The article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" suggests that this technology could allow a computer to detect student confusion or boredom and adjust lessons accordingly. While potentially valuable in certain situations, widespread classroom application is unlikely to be effective.\n\nThe primary challenge lies in the diversity of student emotions within a classroom.  Students react differently to the same material.  For instance, in a math class, some students might find the concepts engaging while others are uninterested.\n\nWhile individualized instruction, as mentioned in paragraph 6, might benefit a single student, adapting a lesson for a class of 30-50 based on the emotions of a few would be impractical and unfair to those engaged with the current lesson plan.  Teaching different lessons simultaneously to different groups within the same class would be logistically challenging and place undue strain on teachers.\n\nA more effective application of FACS in the classroom would be to focus on identifying student confusion rather than boredom.  A bored student is unlikely to become engaged through a simple conversation, whereas a confused student could benefit from individualized attention and clarification.  A teacher's primary concern should be student comprehension and academic progress.\n\nFACS is a powerful tool with significant potential for understanding human behavior.  However, its effectiveness in a group learning environment is limited. While FACS can accurately read individual emotions, applying those readings to modify whole-class instruction is impractical.  It's much more effective for one-on-one assessment of student understanding.  Addressing individual confusion is a viable strategy.  As paragraph 9 humorously suggests, forcing a smile won't solve the underlying issue of student dissatisfaction with a lesson.",

        "The claim that this image depicts a face on Mars is difficult for me to accept.  The evidence presented relies on photographs taken by a machine, not direct human observation. While scientists suggest it's the remnant of an alien structure, their conclusion lacks proof of extraterrestrial existence. If they can capture an image of this supposed \"face,\" why not an image of the aliens themselves?\n\nThe \"face\" could easily be a surface irregularity, with lighting creating a pareidolia effect \u2013 the tendency to perceive meaningful patterns in random stimuli.  The lack of a close-up image from a manned mission fuels this skepticism.  The resemblance to a human face, rather than a deformed creature, further deepens my doubts.  Scientists labeling this an \"alien artifact\" seems premature, especially given the absence of confirmed alien encounters.\n\nThe image itself raises questions. The shadowed right side suggests the shape could simply be a product of the lighting conditions. A ring-like formation at the bottom further complicates the \"face\" interpretation.  Scientists haven't provided a clear basis for their alien artifact claim, especially since they lack confirmed knowledge of what aliens look like. The absence of any comparative alien imagery within the article weakens their argument.  While scientists likely have their reasons for this conclusion, the available evidence points more towards a natural formation than an alien artifact.  Without concrete proof of alien existence and closer examination, the \"face on Mars\" remains unconvincing.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System, while valuable for understanding emotional expressions, may not be practical for use in a classroom setting to interpret students' emotions. Technology has advanced to the point where software can accurately analyze facial expressions to determine emotions, yet it is important to consider that people often hide their true emotions behind their facial expressions. For example, a smile may not always indicate genuine happiness, as individuals may conceal their true feelings.\n\nIn the introduction, it is mentioned that new software has been developed to enhance the accuracy of perceiving others' emotions. This software can analyze facial expressions to provide more precise results, similar to how Leonardo da Vinci studied human anatomy to accurately depict emotions in his paintings. While it may be challenging to describe specific facial traits that convey emotions, it is still possible to infer emotions based on facial expressions, even without a detailed understanding of the Facial Action Coding System.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of technology to interpret emotions through facial expressions may not always be necessary, as individuals can often discern emotions based on facial cues without the need for advanced software. While the Facial Action Coding System offers a systematic approach to understanding facial expressions, it may not be the most practical or effective method for everyday use, especially in a classroom setting.",
        "Do you believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is merely a natural landform rather than an actual face? We share this view as well, given that when the initial image surfaced on the JPL website, it became evident that it was indeed a natural landform. Furthermore, if there were objects such as airplanes in the picture, they would have been identifiable. The image actually depicts a landform commonly found throughout the American West.\n\nWhen Mars Global Surveyor passed over Cydonia on April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team captured an image ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Many eagerly awaited this revealing image upon its release on the JPL website.\n\nGarvin noted, \"As a rule of thumb, one can distinguish objects in a digital image three times larger than the pixel size.\" Therefore, had there been objects like airplanes or pyramids in this picture, they would have been discernible.\n\nThere may be those who argue that Malin's team did not capture this photo with more clarity compared to the original Viking photos or who might see the face as evidence of life on Mars. However, on April 8, 2001,\" Malin's team achieved an extraordinary resolution with each pixel measuring 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking photo from 1976.\n\nUltimately, what is depicted in this picture resembles Martian buttes or mesas commonly seen in America\u2019s western regions. Garvin draws parallels to Middle Butte in Idaho's Snake River Plain\u2014an isolated mesa resembling Mars' Face butte.\n\nIn summary, we are convinced that rather than being an alien monument or face-shaped structure on Mars,\"Face\" simply represents a natural landform common around Earth's American West region\u2014a conclusion supported by evidence pointing towards its geological origin instead of extraterrestrial design.",
        "Computers designed to recognize human emotions primarily focus on external muscle movements in the face. However, these systems lack the sophistication to detect nuanced emotional states, including internal conflicts like hypocrisy.  Furthermore, such technology overlooks the diversity of the human experience.  It fails to account for individuals with exceptional talents or mental health conditions, as well as those prone to frustration in unexpected situations.\n\nConsider the example of a comedian.  A joke may only genuinely amuse 30% of the audience. Yet, if that 30% laughs, the remaining 70% may feel compelled to join in, reducing social tension and supporting the comedian, rather than expressing genuine mirth.\n\nThe text mentions a claim of universality (presumably regarding emotional expression), but this overlooks individual differences, much like the existence of left-handed individuals or those with high IQs.  Forcing the technology to assign an emotion to every individual can lead to feelings of exclusion, potentially contributing to mental health issues like suicidal ideation.\n\nThe text also suggests that faces don't lie.  However, this ignores individuals with Down syndrome, whose facial expressions can be misinterpreted, and deceptive individuals, like criminals who feign remorse.  Students, too, can mask their true feelings.  A student might cheat on an exam and then complain to the teacher about its difficulty.\n\nIn conclusion, I have attempted to demonstrate the inherent limitations of using technology to accurately recognize students' emotional expressions.  There are simply too many variables and nuances in human behavior for current technology to reliably interpret.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\" wasn't created by aliens.  The scientific consensus points to natural landforms as the sole explanation.  It's unlikely aliens would carve a face into a rock; what purpose would that serve?  Scientists agree that natural geological processes are responsible for this formation.\n\nThe face's creation must have occurred long before its discovery.  As stated in paragraph 7, closer examination revealed a natural landform, debunking the theory of an alien monument.  The question of how aliens would have even constructed such a monument remains unanswered.\n\nFurthermore, paragraph 12 clarifies that the image resembles a butte or mesa, landforms common in the American West.  This reinforces the idea of a natural origin, diminishing the likelihood of alien involvement.  The evidence strongly suggests natural processes are responsible.\n\nHowever, some, as highlighted in paragraph 8, speculate that the initial hazy images from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft might have obscured alien markings. This lingering doubt fuels the possibility of an extraterrestrial explanation, offering a sliver of hope for those seeking evidence of alien life.\n\nIn conclusion, the origin of the \"Face on Mars\" remains a subject of fascination.",
        "I believe that implementing the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could significantly benefit both teachers and students. By incorporating the FACS into education, teaching can become more efficient and learning more engaging. This system has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human emotions and could offer new avenues of support for individuals in educational settings and those struggling with depression.\n\nThe introduction of the FACS has enabled us to gain a deeper insight into people's emotional states. Whether it is assisting teachers in creating more interactive lessons to captivate their students or aiding individuals who may be concealing their emotions in seeking help, the FACS plays a crucial role. Since the face can convey emotions more vividly than words, the FACS allows us to delve into the true feelings of individuals. For instance, the system can detect signs of confusion or disinterest in a student and prompt adjustments to the lesson, emulating the effectiveness of a human instructor. This kind of personalized learning can significantly enhance the student's educational experience, making the process more enjoyable and effective.\n\nThe FACS has the potential to bring about a positive transformation in various aspects of education.",
        "Twenty-five years before May 24, 2001, a peculiar event captured public attention on Mars.  In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft, while orbiting Mars and scouting landing sites for its sister ship, Viking 2, captured an image of what appeared to be a shadowy, human-like face on the surface.  This image, taken in the Cydonia region, sparked considerable speculation.\n\nOn April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor, equipped with the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) operated by Michael Malin and his team, finally had its first opportunity to revisit Cydonia. The MOC captured images ten times sharper than the original Viking photograph. Based on this significantly improved imagery, the team concluded that the \"face\" was not an alien monument.\n\nThe Mars Global Surveyor made an even closer pass on April 8, 2001.  \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the 'Face' in the field of view,\" explained  Garvin, a project scientist. Malin's team acquired an exceptionally detailed image of the formation using the camera's maximum resolution.\n\nThe 2001 image achieved a resolution of 1.5 meters per pixel, a dramatic improvement over the 43 meters per pixel resolution of the 1976 Viking image.\n\nAfter extensive analysis of the higher-resolution images, scientists determined that the feature is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common in the American West.",
        "I oppose the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) due to the significant implementation challenges it presents for schools.  The cost, time, and logistical hurdles of equipping every school and computer with this technology are substantial.  Furthermore, the system's efficacy is questionable.  A simple question like, \"Are you okay?\" can often provide more valuable insight into a student's well-being.\n\nEven if schools were to adopt FACS, the process would be incredibly invasive.  Students' pictures would need to be converted into 3-D computer models, and the system would then analyze their 44 major facial muscles, as mentioned in paragraph 3.  Human emotions are complex and fluctuate throughout the day.  Someone might be happy one moment and sad, angry, or stressed the next.  FACS cannot accurately capture this nuance. Imagine a student feeling happy, only to have the program recommend anti-depressants.  Computers, like humans, are fallible.\n\nDirect communication is far more effective than relying on expensive and potentially inaccurate computer programs.  A simple question like, \"Are you okay?\" or \"Are you doing fine?\" can yield valuable information. We can often infer a friend's emotional state simply by observing their facial expression.  Creating 3-D facial models is unnecessary and overlooks the fact that outward appearances can be deceiving.  Someone might smile while experiencing internal turmoil like sadness, anger, or even hidden joy.  True feelings reside within, not on the surface.  Consider watching a sad movie: tears might flow, but they could stem from happiness mingled with sadness.  A computer program cannot discern such complex emotions.  While the movement of facial muscles can offer clues, it's an insufficient basis for a program to accurately assess emotional states.\n\nWhile FACS might seem promising in theory, scaling it to billions of people and millions of schools presents insurmountable challenges.  Even if successful in a small group, how could it possibly be effective in a classroom of 40 students, each with potentially neutral expressions?  Humans can sometimes, though not always, discern emotions through observation, but computers lack this nuanced understanding.  Simply asking, \"Are you okay?\" is a far more efficient and reliable approach.",
        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers it presents because of its similarity to Earth, our home planet. There are significant parallels between Earth and Venus, raising the possibility of life existing on Venus. If life does exist on Venus and conditions are comparable to Earth's, humans could potentially colonize the planet. Scientists should investigate Venus further to uncover more similarities between it and Earth, explore the potential past existence of life on Venus, and assess its habitability for humans in the future.\n\nBy delving into their research on Venus, scientists stand to discover numerous additional resemblances. The second paragraph notes that \"Venus is akin to Earth in density and size,\" emphasizing its likeness to our planet in various aspects. Furthermore, paragraph four highlights that \"Venus boasts a surface terrain resembling rocky sediment with features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,\" indicating not only shared characteristics with Earth but also familiar geographical elements. These observations underscore the need for further exploration to unveil additional parallels between these two planets.\n\nScientists should probe into whether there was past life on Venus. As mentioned in paragraph four, astronomers speculate that \"Venus may have been among the most earth-like planets in our solar system at one point.\" Additionally, this paragraph discusses how \"Venus likely had vast oceans that could have supported diverse forms of life similar to those found on Earth.\" These assertions imply that anciently there might have been water bodies teeming with various life forms akin to those seen on our own planet.\n\nStudying Venus could help determine if human habitation is feasible or too perilous due to extreme conditions there. The second paragraph alludes to how \"Despite its proximity [to us], studying Mars remains a challenging endeavor for humanity.\" Moreover, in paragraph three it's stated: \"[The] conditions [on Mars] are considerably more severe than anything encountered by humans on Earth.\"",
        "I believe driverless cars are dangerous. They are not yet on the road because there isn't enough information to determine their safety. While imagining driverless cars is fascinating, several considerations must be addressed before integrating them into society. BMW has announced the development of \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" a system that can manage driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. This car is equipped with special touch sensors to ensure the driver maintains contact with the steering wheel. Although the driverless car that BMW is introducing sounds intriguing, it is not entirely safe. It is not fully autonomous, as someone must hold the steering wheel. What if the driver falls asleep while the car is operating, and the car tries to alert the driver due to an approaching work zone or accident, and the driver does not wake up?",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text about driverless cars, with enhanced flow, coherence, and corrected spelling:\n\nDriverless cars represent an inevitable technological advancement that promises to revolutionize transportation. While people have dreamed of autonomous vehicles since the days of \"The Flintstones\" and perhaps even earlier, this technology is finally becoming a reality. The prospect of reaching one's destination safely and effortlessly, while potentially surpassing the reliability of human drivers, is both exciting and transformative.\n\nSafety and efficiency must work in tandem for driverless cars to succeed.",
        "The concept of driverless cars is becoming less interesting to some because these vehicles still require human intervention in certain situations. For example, they alert the driver to take control when navigating driveways or dealing with complex traffic scenarios. Moreover, these cars can only navigate themselves on clear roads, which limits their autonomy.\n\nDriverless cars could be particularly beneficial for individuals who lack the physical ability to operate traditional vehicles, such as those without arms or legs. For these people, a car that can assist with tasks like parking might be appealing. However, if a so-called smart car cannot reliably manage traffic and requires frequent manual intervention, it hardly seems more advantageous than using cruise control on a regular vehicle.\n\nI have concerns about the safety of these cars. While I understand the vision behind them, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have a vehicle that can't fully handle all driving tasks independently. If it's smart enough to switch lanes autonomously, shouldn't it also manage more challenging scenarios like navigating through traffic accidents or pulling into driveways? Additionally, even if such technology becomes available for purchase, its likely high cost may restrict ownership primarily to affluent individuals.\n\nI appreciate the idea of self-driving cars and acknowledge their potential impact; however, I'm hesitant about adopting them soon due to uncertainties surrounding their operation and reliance on electronic systems. Perhaps I'm mistaken and they will become one of the greatest automotive innovations ever\u2014potentially generating millions in revenue\u2014but that's just my perspective based on current limitations.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves flow and coherence:\n\n# The Truth About Mars's Famous \"Face\"\n\n## Introduction\nThe famous \"face\" photographed by NASA on Mars has captured public imagination for decades. As noted in the article, \"The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows\u2014even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" However, despite widespread speculation, this formation is not evidence of alien life or artificial construction.\n\n## Natural Formation Evidence\nThe structure is simply a natural landform that happens to resemble a face from certain angles. This was confirmed when \"thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"\n\n## Geographic Characteristics\nSeveral features support its natural origin:\n- It remains stationary, like any geological formation\n- It's relatively small and difficult to locate\n- It blends seamlessly with surrounding Martian terrain\n- As Garvin notes, \"It's not easy to target Cydonia\"\n\n## Earth Comparisons\nThe formation bears striking similarities to known geological features on Earth. Garvin observes, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho... a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" This comparison to Earth's natural formations further supports its non-artificial origin.\n\n## Public Engagement\nWhile the \"face\" successfully captured public interest\u2014\"The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars\"\u2014it's important to accept the scientific evidence. The formation's facial appearance is merely a coincidence of natural geological processes.\n\n## Conclusion\nDespite its fascinating appearance, multiple lines of evidence confirm this Martian formation is natural: its geological characteristics, similarity to Earth formations, and static nature all point to a natural origin.",

In reality, it is a natural land feature.\n\nThe Face was captured using a high-quality camera capable of producing images three times larger than the pixel size. This means that if there were other alien-made objects on Mars, they would have been visible. The absence of additional objects supporting the Face's origin as an alien creation suggests otherwise.\n\nThe Face bears a striking resemblance to Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Geologist Garvin noted that the Face and Middle Butte are of similar height, reinforcing the notion that the Face is a natural land formation akin to the Middle Butte.\n\nWhen the Face image was shared on a JPL website, it was determined to be a natural land feature.

Personally, I don't trust human drivers on the roads. People get distracted easily, have varying reaction times, and often demonstrate unsafe behavior. Driverless cars can effectively address these concerns.\n\nThe primary issue is human distraction. Smart cars, in contrast, are specifically engineered for driving and analyzing road conditions. The most compelling feature addressing this concern is LIDAR technology: \"It uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.\"\n\nAnother significant concern is human reaction time. Many drivers lack the split-second responses needed to prevent accidents. Autonomous vehicles excel in this area, as evidenced by their capabilities: \"The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\"\n\nFinally, human drivers often engage in unsafe behaviors. From texting while driving to making erratic turns without signaling, these actions endanger both the driver and others on the road. Smart cars incorporate various safety measures, including systems that ensure driver attention and provide advance warning of potential hazards.",

There are many reasons why you should participate in this Seagoing Cowboy program, so just keep on reading to see what those reasons are.\n\nI think you should try it out but if you don't right now, you might want to at least research this and see if you would like to try out this seagoing Cowboys program. I think you need to try the seagoing Cowboy program because in the passage \"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,\" there was a man named Luke Bomberger who loved this program. He even experienced going over the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and also went through the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II. Would you like to experience that type of fun?\n\nAlso, I think that joining the Seagoing Cowboy program is important because in paragraph two of \"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,\" it states that Luke helped recover food supplies, animals, and more. Forty-four nations joined together to form an UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) that needed assistance recovering from disasters.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that participating in the Seagoing Cowboy program is crucial because paragraph six mentions caring for animals on their way back from safety. Would you like to save a poor animal's life? It describes how bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from lower holds of ships and how they have to clean stalls \u2013 which means these animals need your help with feeding them and cleaning their living spaces.\n\nLastly, I think it's worth considering joining because paragraph four details how Luke Bomberger planned on going into military service when he turned eighteen but his cattle-boat trip experience led authorities telling him he should continue what he was doing as it helped significantly enough for him not needing military service.",

        "The prospect of driverless cars, while technologically intriguing, raises serious concerns about safety, economic impact, and the loss of a cherished rite of passage.  Learning to drive is a formative experience, creating lasting memories of mishaps, bonding with instructors, and the motivation to excel in school and save for that first car.  Ask anyone, and they can recount the details of their driving lessons as if it were yesterday. Driverless cars threaten to erase this significant milestone.\n\nThe excitement of getting behind the wheel, the freedom of the open road, and the social bonding with friends are all integral parts of the teenage experience.  Driverless cars eliminate the joy of driving, reducing it to a mere automated function. What's the thrill of sitting passively while a machine takes control?\n\nMoreover, the safety implications are alarming. Even with attentive drivers, millions die in car crashes yearly.  Introducing driverless cars, with the potential for driver complacency and inattention, could drastically increase these numbers. Human nature dictates that comfort levels rise with automated tasks.  Thousands of unalert and overly comfortable drivers on the road is a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe economic consequences are equally dire.  Millions of teenagers learn to drive through driver's education programs, a multi-million dollar industry that would be decimated by driverless cars.  Thousands of driving instructors would lose their jobs.\n\nFinally, the elimination of driving lessons undermines a crucial learning experience. Mastering a vehicle instills responsibility, teaches spatial awareness and quick decision-making, and builds confidence.  These skills extend beyond driving and are valuable life lessons.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of driverless cars, while potentially beneficial to the manufacturers, poses significant risks.",
        "In 1976, NASA captured a picture of Mars using the Viking 1 spacecraft. This photo depicted a Martian mesa that bore a striking resemblance to a human face. Upon its unveiling to the public, widespread excitement ensued. Speculations arose, with some attributing the formation to extraterrestrial origins, while others posited that it was simply a natural landform on Mars.\n\nTo substantiate my claim that this photo showcases a typical geological feature on Mars, let's examine the timeline of when these images were captured. When Viking 1 initially photographed the \"Face,\" limitations in photography technology hindered our ability to discern intricate details. By contrast, technological advancements by 2001 allowed for clearer imagery when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) revisited and photographed the \"Face.\" Despite improved clarity in the MGS image, obscured by clouds at the time, removing which might have confirmed its status as a landform earlier.\n\nDuring this period, conspiracy theorists suggested that NASA concealed evidence of life on Mars from public knowledge out of reluctance or secrecy. However intriguing such discoveries would be scientifically significant; it seems implausible for such groundbreaking revelations to be withheld from humanity under any circumstances without sufficient substantiation.\n\nThis aligns with my initial assertion regarding technological progression over time\u2014comparing photos from 1976 and 2001 highlights notable disparities in image quality due to advancements in technology. For instance, discrepancies in shading between Voyager 1's photo and MGS's depiction contribute significantly to differing perceptions of features present on Mars.\n\nDespite our collective fascination with discovering life beyond Earth and hopes ignited by anomalies like the Face on Mars\u2014scientific consensus indicates unfavorable conditions for sustaining life on Mars currently\u2014facing reality is sometimes essential amid seemingly fantastical possibilities within our vast universe; acknowledging we may indeed be alone encourages seeking factual answers rather than clinging solely onto romanticized notions of extraterrestrial existence as portrayed by visions like The Face on Mars.",

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n**The Truth Behind Blurry Mars Photos**\n\nSnowy conditions inevitably result in poor camera visibility. Given this fact, how can anyone definitively claim these images show evidence of alien civilization? Consider that these photographs were taken in December, when the northern hemisphere experiences frequent snowfall, making clear photography extremely challenging.\n\nHave you ever looked skyward on a snowy day? The sky is typically obscured by dense cloud cover. So how can anyone credibly suggest these images capture an ancient alien civilization? It's virtually impossible to obtain a clear picture under such conditions. Between the vast distance from Mars to Earth and the adverse weather conditions, the only way to definitively prove extraterrestrial existence would be through direct exploration of Mars\u2014something humans have yet to accomplish.\n\nThe enthusiasm for these claims likely stems from NASA's potential to secure increased funding through the discovery of an ancient civilization. Similar stories emerge regularly, with claims of discovering evidence of ancient life, but these invariably turn out to be nothing more than naturally formed rocks.\n\nTo reiterate, snowy conditions compromise photographic clarity. This particular image simply captures a rock formation that, when photographed from a specific angle, creates a face-like illusion.",
        "Driving has been an essential skill ever since Ford introduced the Model T. Since then, the use of cars has only become more prevalent in society. People rely on cars for commuting, traveling on vacations, and chauffeuring others. While driving, individuals could engage in more productive activities, such as preparing for their destination, completing homework, or enjoying leisure activities. The legitimacy of developing driverless cars is underscored by the daily routines people navigate and the convenience these cars could provide, once the necessary laws are enacted to make them a reality.\n\nToday, people's lives are filled with demanding tasks, such as work, school, and extracurricular activities. A significant amount of time is spent driving, time that could be allocated to more productive pursuits. Advances in sensor technology, as discussed, have paved the way for the possibility of cars that can nearly drive themselves. As companies like Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Nissan make strides toward creating fully autonomous vehicles, individuals still face numerous challenges, aside from driving, that technology could alleviate. Hence, the development of self-driving technology, which could reduce the driver's workload, would be highly beneficial to society, freeing up valuable time.",
        "The author suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its inherent dangers, a point I wholeheartedly agree with. My purpose here is to elaborate on the value and validity of this argument.\n\nThe author provides compelling support for this perspective. One particularly persuasive piece of evidence is the statement, \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\"  This highlights the significant challenge posed by Venus's proximity to Earth.  Furthermore, the author emphasizes the importance of speed and space in this context. While seemingly less critical at first glance, these factors contribute to a more nuanced understanding.  The author explains that Venus's relative closeness to Earth fluctuates due to variations in orbital speeds; sometimes Mars is actually closer.  The \"space\" aspect refers to the numerous spacecraft that have attempted to land on this cloud-shrouded world, underscoring humanity's persistent fascination with Venus.",
        "I believe that the Facial Action Coding System could be extremely beneficial in a school environment. The reason I believe this technology could thrive in schools is because the student mind is very fragile and children may feel sad from being bullied without expressing their emotions. Implementing this system in schools could help reduce the risks of suicides and school shootings by providing support to the children in need. It could also help in identifying and addressing instances of bullying among students and even prevent harmful situations at the children's homes. It is heartbreaking to learn that a fellow classmate has taken their own life. As a student at SCHOOL_NAME, I can empathize with the pain and loss that such an event brings.",

        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text about driverless cars:\n\n# The Promise and Perils of Driverless Cars\n\nDriverless cars have long captured our imagination through television and media, evolving from science fiction to an approaching reality. As Sebastian, the founder of the Google Car project, suggests, autonomous vehicles may soon become commonplace. However, several critical concerns surround their implementation: safety, cost, and legal implications.\n\n## Safety Concerns\nThe primary concern with autonomous vehicles is safety. Current \"driverless\" technology still requires human oversight, as noted in industry reports: \"The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" This raises questions about the technology's reliability and its ability to prevent accidents without human intervention. The promise of fully autonomous vehicles that require no human attention remains uncertain.\n\n## Economic Barriers\nThe technological sophistication required for truly autonomous vehicles presents significant economic challenges. As industry research indicates, \"they needed a whole lot of sensors\" just for current semi-autonomous capabilities. This extensive technological investment suggests that future fully autonomous vehicles may be prohibitively expensive for many interested consumers.\n\n## Legal Complexities\nThe legal framework surrounding driverless cars presents another significant challenge. A crucial question remains unanswered: \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault\u2014the driver or the manufacturer?\" This uncertainty has led to the need for updated laws \"to cover the liability in the case of an accident.\" Currently, many states remain cautious, restricting the testing of autonomous vehicles due to safety concerns.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile driverless cars represent an exciting technological advancement, significant questions persist regarding their safety, accessibility, and legal implications.",
        "Will this technology be valuable in the classroom? While it seems impressive, the question remains: will it truly be beneficial? If the technology can read facial expressions, it could potentially be useful, but here\u2019s why it might not be.\n\nHave you ever felt bored in school? We all do at times; it\u2019s a natural part of the experience. Now, imagine if our computers could detect our boredom\u2014would that automatically make lessons more engaging? Lessons are often pre-designed or created by teachers. If our computers detect boredom, the expectation might be to modify the lesson. But how would that work? Teachers would need to prepare multiple versions of a lesson to accommodate different responses. Additionally, some school topics are inherently dull, and it might be challenging to make them more engaging.\n\nThere are, however, a few potential benefits, such as the technology's ability to detect if someone is feeling down. It could be a helpful tool for students who might need support but are reluctant to ask. Yet, if implemented, the technology might merely highlight the numerous stressed faces of students overwhelmed by homework, while trying to balance their personal lives. This, however, raises the question: does it infringe on personal space? Many people prefer to keep their emotions private, and the use of such technology in schools could compromise the privacy we value.\n\nWhile the technology might be a step forward, is it the right fit for the school environment?",
        "Is the Facial Action Coding System Useful in Classrooms?\n\nImagine a machine capable of not only recognizing but also understanding emotions through facial expressions. Such a machine exists: the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. This technology could be incredibly beneficial in classrooms. It could identify students' emotions, help prevent or address issues before they arise, and provide teachers with valuable feedback that might not be communicated verbally.\n\nFACS creates a 3D model of the face, analyzing all 44 major facial muscles to interpret a person\u2019s emotions. For instance, raising the frontalis pars lateralis, the muscles above the eyes, indicates surprise. Implementing this technology in classrooms could help educators discern students' emotions and understand their feelings better.\n\nRecognizing emotions in the classroom can be extremely beneficial. Students, on average, spend 6-8 hours a day in classrooms, and their emotions, still in development, are a crucial part of their maturation. Occasionally, students might experience breakdowns or outbursts for various reasons. A student, for example, could be stressed about their grades, which might lead to a decline in performance. With FACS, such behavior could be anticipated, allowing teachers to provide the necessary encouragement or academic assistance. Furthermore, the school environment, with its numerous variables, can also pose challenges.",
        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text about driverless cars:\n\n**The Superior Safety of Driverless Cars**\n\nAfter careful consideration, I firmly believe that driverless cars represent a significant advancement in automotive safety compared to conventional vehicles. The technology's impressive track record speaks for itself\u2014these vehicles have logged more than half a million miles without a single accident.\n\nThe sophisticated technology powering these vehicles is remarkable. Equipped with an array of sensors, driverless cars can detect potential hazards such as accidents or road blockages well in advance. As noted in the source material, \"The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.\" In essence, these vehicles operate with the precision of a professional driver.\n\nOne of the most compelling advantages of driverless cars is their potential to eliminate human error, particularly in cases involving impaired driving. While conventional vehicles remain vulnerable to reckless behavior and drunk driving, autonomous vehicles effectively remove these risks through their sensor-based operation system. This makes them an especially attractive option for younger drivers and those concerned about road safety.\n\nThe investment in a driverless car is undoubtedly worthwhile, considering the enhanced safety features and technological advancements."
