        "Stochastic models are used in diverse field as ecology, genetics, economics and engineering. Closed form solutions of such models are know, however, only for some of the simplest drift and diffusion functions. Therfore, there has always been a need of numerical methods that solves comples stochastic models and hence the Fokker-Planck equation. The global dynamical behaviour of a nonlinear system with noise is formally described by the probability density function (PDF) evolution along deterministic and diffusuion that satisfies the Fokker-Planck (FP) partial differential equation [19] . The FP system that has the capability of connecting stochastic and deterministic dynamics has been applied to various applications in physics, chemistry, biology and finance [8, 9, 19, 20, 22] .\nIn this article, we consider the FP equations that corresponds to the stochastic differential equations. In particular, the stochastic process defined by the following multidimensional model [16] dX t = b(X t , t)dt + \u03c3(X t , t)dW t\n(1)\nEQUATION\nwhere X t \u2208 R d is the state variable and dW t \u2208 R l denotes the Wiener process. Moreover, \u03c3 \u2208 R d\u00d7l is a full rank dispersion matrix. Note that a statistical distribution can describes the state of the stochastic process. For this, the probability density function (PDF) distribution and the evolution of this PDF distribution can be modelled by the FP equation. The numerical solution of the FP equations has been obtained by several researchers. One of the most popular scheme in this regard which solves the linear FP equation is the Chang-Cooper (CC) scheme introduced by Chang and Cooper in 1970 [9] . One of the impotent features of CC scheme is that the discrete solution preserves some intrinsic properties of the original given problem, one such as positivity and conservation of the total probability. Later, several improvements have been done [13] , where we have seen high order finite difference schemes and also the nonlinear case. Finite element schemes have also been discussed, see [22] . It is also worth noting that some semi-analytic techniques are employed to solve the FP equation, for example, in [12] the FP equation is investigated by the Adomian decomposition method. In [23] , variational iteration method is presented to solve the FP equation. Moreover, a finite difference scheme with cubic C 1 -spline collocation method for solving the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation is presented in [21] . A fast algorithm for the numerical solution of the FP equation is presented by [17, 17] and a finite difference scheme, in one-dimension, using a staggered grid to solve the Fokker-Planck equations with drift-admitting jumps is presented in [10] .",
        "Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) into terrestrial communication systems is an important step towards truly ubiquitous connectivity [1] , [2] . An essential building block are small satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) that are currently deployed in private sector mega constellations [3] - [5] . Their main benefits are much lower propagation delays and deployment costs due to the LEO when compared to more traditional high-throughput satellites [6] - [8] in medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary orbit (GEO). While current systems focus on connecting ground stations (GSs) to a single satellite, combining several low cost satellites in swarms leads to increased flexibility and scalability [9] .\nEspecially the joint transmission of multiple satellites forming large virtual antenna arrays promises tremendous spectral efficiency gains solely due to the increased spatial separation of antennas [10] - [12] . However, the straightforward implementation of conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transmission schemes requires complete instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and inter-satellite coordination of joint beamforming. This is infeasible due to very short channel coherence times resulting from high orbital velocities in combination with comparably large propagation delays, both in ground-to-satellite and in inter-satellite links. In this paper, we show that this is not an obstacle if positional information is exploited. In contrast to complete CSI, this information is often readily available or easily determined from the deterministic movement of satellites. This leads to an approximate channel model, which is employed to derive a beamspace MIMO [13] , [14] based distributed linear precoder and equalizer. The precoder has low complexity, requires, at each satellite, only knowledge of the own rotation and the position of itself and the GS, and achieves close to optimal spectral efficiency. Similarly, the equalizer only needs angle of arrival (AoA) information for the satellites and, given proper design of the satellite swarm, shows nearly optimal performance. We obtain an analytical solution on the optimal swarm layout and numerically evaluate the system performance.\nThe related literature can be summarized as follows: In [10] , the downlink (DL) from a satellite swarm with more than 50 nano-satellites towards a single antenna ground station (GS) is studied. It is shown that, if the signals of all satellites add up in phase at the GS a high array gain is achieved.",
        "In a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations there may be exhibited a certain kind of qualitative behavior called limit cycles near a singularity of the system. A limit cycle of a differential system is an isolated periodic orbit of the system. The concept of limit cycles was introduced by Poincar\u00e9 [45] in the late 1800s when he observed the behavior of limit cycles and built up the qualitative theory of differential equations. Since then the analysis of limit-cycle bifurcation has been long-standing as a challenging problem under extensive investigation. In particular, determination of the number and relative positions of limit cycles for planar polynomial differential systems is known as the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem [23] that is still open.\nIn connection with Hilbert's problem the literature is vast (see [25, 31] and references therein). The qualitative theory of differential equations established by Poincar\u00e9 [45] and Lyapunov [41] was developed further by Bendixson [6] , Andronov [1] , Arnold [2] , and many others for qualitative analysis of global stability, local stability of equilibria, and bifurcation of limit cycles for various classes of differential systems. In the long history of development there were published a few results on the number of limit cycles. For instance, in a paper of 1955, Petrovsky and Landis [43] attempted to prove that planar quadratic differential systems can have at most 3 limit cycles. Surprisingly, in 1979, Chen and Wang [12] and Shi [51] independently found counter-examples to the result of Petrovskii and Landis, showing that planar quadratic differential systems can have 4 limit cycles. These unexpected, inconsistent results have stimulated a lot of interest in the research of limit cycles for quadratic and cubic systems. In particular, Li and others [32] proved that planar cubic differential systems may have at least 13 limit cycles, the best lower bound known so far.",
        "Each year, large number of traffic accidents with a large number of injuries and fatalities occur [1] . To reduce these accidents, automotive companies have been developing newer and better active and passive safety measures to increase the safety of passengers and other road users. With the developments in connected vehicle infrastructure on the roads and on-board-units for Vehicle to Everything (V2X) connectivity in newer vehicles, V2X communication offers possibilities for preventing accidents as V2X equipped vehicles have awareness of other vehicles and road users around them through Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) communication. Additionally, V2I communication can provide information about the traffic signal status and intersection geometry. By utilizing all of this information, both autonomous and manually driven vehicles can navigate better and regulate the speed in a more fuel efficient way. Among all the V2X methods, V2I communication is relatively easy to implement and show benefit on a wider range since it does not rely on all of the vehicles having the on board communication equipment. Implementation of a Roadside Unit (RSU) on an intersection is enough to benefit from V2I applications as long as our own vehicle is equipped with an OBU. Moreover, with an implementation of camera or Lidar based recognition system, the RSU can publish information about the other vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists approaching to the intersection. This enables using V2V applications to a certain extent, even when other vehicles do not have any OBU equipment [2] .\nV2I communication can be beneficial from many different aspects. It can be used to regulate traffic light timings [3, 4] , to reduce traffic congestion and to provide much efficient travel for all road users. It can be used for map matching to enhance localization [5] .",
        "With the recent advances in epigenetics, more than 170 distinct modifications have been identified on RNA. Among them, 5-formylcytidine (f5C) has emerged as an abundant regulated modification. f5C was first discovered in mitochondrial tRNA Met of bovine and nematode in 1994 [1, 2] and was also found in squids, frogs, chickens, rats, and fruit flies in recent decades [3] [4] [5] .\nDuring the setting process of f5C on the transcriptome, C34 (position 34 of the mammalian mitochondrial methionine transfer RNA) is methylated to form 5-methylcytosine (m5C) under the catalysis of NSUN (NOL1/NOP2/sun domain) RNA methyltransferase. Subsequently, m5C is oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hm5C) and then to f5C [6] . Although the functions of f5C are still largely unknown, it strongly indicates that loss of f5C will result in pathological consequences [7] . Takemoto et al. found that f5C in mitochondrial tRNA Met plays a crucial role in recognizing and decoding the nonuniversal AUA codon as Met [8] . In addition, two pathogenic point mutations in mitochondrial tRNA Met were found to prevent NSUN3 (NOP2/Sun RNA Methyltransferase 3)-mediated methylation. Without NSUN3, mitochondrial protein synthesis will dramatically decrease and reduce oxygen consumption, leading to defective mitochondrial activity [7] . Murakami et al. found that f5C is essential for mice's embryonic development and respiratory complexes [9] . However, many functions of f5C are still unknown, such as the contribution of f5C to the structure of the hmtRNA Met and its possible participation in either chain initiation or chain elongation by this unique tRNA Met [10] .\nTo make accurate identification of f5C, researchers have proposed several approaches based on biological experiments up to now. On the basis of Friedlander synthesis, a bisulfite-free and singlebase-resolution method was developed by inducing the transition of f5C to T transition [11, 12] . However, this method is limited in application due to no way to efficiently and completely convert m5C to f5C [13] . To address this limitation, Liu et al. present an alternative method, named TETassisted pyridine borane sequencing (TAPS), for the detection of m5C and hm5C. TAPS fusions TET oxidation to 5-carboxycytosine (5cac) with pyridine borane reduction of ca5C to Dihydrouracil (DHU), and DHU will be converted to thymine during Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [14] . Compared with bisulfite sequencing, TAPS achieved better performance in wholegenome sequencing of mouse embryonic stem cells [15] . Inspired by their approach, Wang et al. developed a mutation-assisted profiling method in 2022 [16] . This mutation-assisted profiling method, named f5C-seq, can provide a single-base resolution map of f5C on the transcriptome.\nAlthough experiments can provide reliable location information on mRNA, it takes considerable time and cost for the verification of all the f5C candidates. Recently, with the development of machine learning, computational methods have become increasingly popular as useful alternative methods [17] [18] [19] [20] . To date, several computational methods have been developed for the recognition of RNA or DNA modification. For example, iDNA6Ma-Rice [17] , iDNA6mA-PseKNC [18] , i6mA-Fuse [19] , Meta-i6mA [20] , and i6mA-vote [21] are excellent prediction models for the N6methyladenosine (6mA) modification.",
        "It is envisioned that in the near future transportation systems would be composed of vehicles with varying levels of connectivity and autonomy. Connected vehicle (CV) technology facilitates communication among vehicles, the infrastructure, and other road users Monteil et al. (2013) , allowing vehicles to see beyond the drivers' line of sight, and the transportation infrastructure to be proactive in responding to stochastic changes in road conditions and travel demand.\nAutonomous vehicle technology enables automation of vehicles at different levels, where level 0 automation indicates no automation, and automation levels 1 and 2 refer to a single and multiple driving assistant systems being present in the vehicle, respectively. Level 3 automation allows the transfer of control authority between the human driver and the autonomous entity when the automation fails. Level 4 autonomy allows for the vehicle to control all functionalities within specified regions. Finally, in level 5 autonomy, vehicles can travel anywhere without any intervention from human drivers Committee et al. (2014) .\nAlthough each of the connected and automated vehicle technologies can be deployed independently in a vehicle, when combined they can provide a synergistic effect that goes beyond the sum of their individual benefits. It is expected that upon deployment, the connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology could significantly improve mobility, enhance traffic flow stability, reduce congestion, and improve fuel economy, among other benefits. The degree to which such benefits can be realized in real-world conditions depends on a wide array of factors, among which trajectory planning of CAVs plays a major role Gasparetto et al. (2015) . The main purpose of trajectory planning is to provide a vehicle with a collision-free path, considering the vehicle dynamics, the surrounding traffic environment, and traffic rules Zhang et al. (2013) . More advanced trajectory planning techniques could incorporate secondary objectives such as achieving fuel economy Zeng and Wang (2018) , Han (2014) , Yu et al. (2016) , Lee (2011) .\nTraditionally, trajectory planning has been mainly based on vehicle dynamics constraints, such as acceleration range, steering performance, etc. More advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), e.g., adaptive cruise control (ACC), enhance trajectory planning through utilizing data collected by vehicle on-board sensors.",
        "Typical passenger vehicles emit about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide CO 2 per year. The European Union's Emission Trading System (EU-ETS) is the world's first major carbon trading market with the main goal to combat climate change and reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in a cost effective way. The EU-ETS works on a Cap-and-Trade (CAP) principle which allows companies that generate point source emissions to receive or buy emission allowances, which can be traded as needed [1] . The process of our B-ETS CAP program is described in Figure 1 , where it is seen that it is based on a complex centralized method of trading among the organizations involved. The first step in CAP is to make a centralized decision (by a regulatory agency or some other collective entity) on the aggregate quantity of emissions allowed. Allowances are then written in accordance with this quantity, after which they are distributed among the sources responsible for the emissions.\nSince 2018, the EU-ETS began penalizing vehicle manufacturers for exceeding the targets for fleet-wide emissions for new vehicles sold in any given year. The manufacturers are required to pay an excess emissions premium for each newly registered car. A penalty of e95 must be paid for each gram per km above the target [1] and the target of CO 2 for the 2020-2021 period is set to 95 grams per km. In this work, we address the need for a new trusted and distributed system which can audit emissions at the vehicle-level.\nThe emerging Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) brought a new era of distributed peerto-peer applications and guarantees trust among involved parties. The terms DLT and Blockchain will be used interchangeably throughout this paper, Blockchains are a type of DLTs, where chains of blocks are made up of digital pieces of information called transactions and every node maintains a copy of the ledger. In DLTs, the authentication process relies on consensus among multiple nodes in the network [2] . Each record has a timestamp and cryptographic signature; the system is secure and maintains a transaction ledger that is immutable and traceable.",
        "Machine learning (ML) is the study of algorithms that learn models directly from data [94] . Such algorithms are typically self-improving -their parameters are updated iteratively based on the data they receive, thereby learning a model that is representative of the data. Once an ML model is trained, it is usually evaluated on unseen data in order to test its generalization capabilities. The ability to generalize to new situations is one of the most important aspects of ML models, and is perhaps the reason such models are often referred to as \"intelligent\" [131] . In other words, ML models use information from the past (i.e., historical data) to make predictions about the future (i.e., unseen data).\nThe field of ML has enjoyed great success in the last decade primarily due to the increased availability of data and computational resources [4] . As ML models have become more prominent in decision-making scenarios [22] , there has been an increased demand for ensuring such models are (i) fair, (ii) accountable, (iii) confidential, and (iv) transparent [99] . 1 However, ML models can be difficult to interpret due to their complex architectures and the large numbers of parameters involved, effectively deeming them \"black-boxes\" [20] . In this thesis, we primarily focus on developing methods to increase transparency, which we define as mechanisms that provide insight into an ML model. This knowledge is typically presented to a user in the form of an explanation.\nRecently, the artificial intelligence (AI) research community has embarked on the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI): a relatively new subfield of AI where the aim is to explain predictions from complex ML models [47] . Explanations can be used to make ML models more accountable to various stakeholders involved in the pipeline by providing insight into not only how the model arrived at its decision, but also how to change or contest the decision, if necessary [141] . We distinguish between two main types of explanations:\n\u2022 Behavior-based explanations: provide insight into how an ML model makes predictions from an algorithmic or mathematical perspective. For example, ranking the most important features [86, 107] , identifying influential [69, 116] or prototypical [73, 129] training samples, or generating counterfactual perturbations [122, 139, 141] . Behavior-based explanations are important for understanding the internal processes of ML models.\n\u2022 Process-based explanations: provide insight into the ML modeling pipeline. For example, detailing how the data were collected and preprocessed [39] , or reporting on how the model was trained and evaluated [91] . Process-based explanations are important for ensuring that ML research is conducted in a responsible and reproducible manner.\nThis thesis has three parts: the first focuses on algorithms, the second focuses on users, and the third focuses on pedagogy. In the first two parts of this thesis, we develop methods for generating behavior-based explanations, which is what the majority of existing XAI methods produce.",
        "For decades, the world has been comprehensively mapped in 2D, however a vertical dimension remains underexplored despite its huge potential, which is even more critical in Global South areas due to inherent mapping inequality and diverse data availability. Mapping human settlements as a 3D representation of reality requires an accurate description of vertical dimension besides the 2D footprints and shapes [19, 11, 14, 7, 23] . Such 3D representation of human settlements is of significant importance in many aspects, for instance, quiet and shadow routing [35] , environmental exposure modeling [2, 40, 34] , architecture and city planning [32, 36] and population capacity estimation [37, 21] . However, it remains challenging to derive low-cost and open-source 3D representation of buildings at scale. In this paper, with \"low-cost\", we mainly refer to the cost of data acquisition in 3D building modeling.\nGiven existing methods of photogrammetry and remote sensing, 3D city reconstruction is still a high-cost and time-consuming task, which mostly requires extensive expert knowledge and a large amount of geospatial data (e.g., cadastral data, airborne photogrammetry data). This fact will certainly increase the difficulty of ordinary stakeholders and city governments with limited funding in establishing 3D city modeling systems for their well-being demands. Fortunately, the increasing availability of Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI) together with crowdsourcing technology [16] has provided a low-cost and scalable solution of mapping our world even in a 3D representation. OpenStreetMap (OSM), as the most successful VGI project, was considered as a valuable global data source for creating large-scale 3D city models [14, 12] .",
        "A geometric edge-to-edge tiling is a covering of the two dimensional plane by polygonal tiles, such that there is no hole, no two tiles overlap, and adjacent tiles share a full edge. When all tiles are rhombuses (have four sides of equal lengths), we call it an edge-to-edge rhombus tiling. The most famous examples are certainly Penrose tilings [Pen74] . They received great attention, for their aesthetics and combinatorial properties in connexion with the growth of quasicrystals [BG17] . They have the property of being aperiodic (no translation vector leaves the tiling unchanged), and quasiperiodic (every finite subset of tiles appears infinitely often).\nIn [AI16] , it has been proven that, at first sight surprisingly, regular decagons emerge as fundamental elements of the structure of Penrose tilings. From an initial finite set of selected tiles called patch, the edge-to-edge diffusion process (at each discrete step, tiles adjacent to the current selected patch are included in the selection) produces a regular decagon at the limit (after renormalization). This limit shape is called the corona limit. The authors of [AI16] studied the corona limits of Penrose tilings through the pattern of signal propagation in a simple growth cellular automata, using combinatorial tools related to local dynamical behaviors specific to Penrose tilings (Ammann bars). Regular corona limits obviously appear on simple periodic tilings such as triangular, square and hexagonal grids, and have also been characterized on other periodic tilings [ACIK19] . The corona limits of multigrid dual tilings are also discussed in [DHS22] , where the authors state a similar result without a full formal proof.\nIn the 1980s, de Bruijn discovered a duality between a class of edge-to-edge rhombus tilings and regular multigrids [dB81, dB86] . That is, the former are obtained from a finite family of infinitely many evenly spaced parallel lines (along a finite set of directions called normal vectors; each group of parallel lines also has a reference position called offset) by a correspondence associating a tile to each intersection of two lines. The corresponding tile is, in terms of Euclidean distance, not far from the intersection (up to a uniform linear map). To lever the results of [AI16] , we first consider corona limits on the multigrid, in order to take advantage of its embodiment of the tiling's regularities. During a second step, we transfer our characterization of corona limits on the multigrid, to the dual edge-to-edge rhombus tilings.\nLimit shapes of growth processes on R d (and Z d ) have been studied in [GG93] , for threshold dynamics (\u03b8 > 0) defined over a given finite neighborhood (N \u2282 R d ): an element x \u2208 R d is added to the current selection A \u2282 R d at the next step when the Lebesgues measure of its set of selected neighbors reaches the threshold (|A \u2229 (x + N )| \u2265 \u03b8). It has been proven that, except in degenerated cases, there is a unique limit shape which is a polygon.",
        "One of the most well-known and long-standing problems in computer science is the question of whether P = NP. A solution to the problem would have wide-ranging implications to everything from economics to cybersecurity. To this end many have claimed to have found a proof that either P = NP or P = NP. However, to this date no such claim has been found to be correct.\nThere are various methods for attempting such a proof. One such method is by using lower bounds on the complexity of circuits. By showing that a known NP-complete problem has an exponential lower-bounded circuit complexity, you show that P = NP. In his paper \"A solution of the P versus NP problem based on specific property of clique function\" [Sim19] , Sima tries to do precisely this. Sima analyzes the clique function and attempts to show that the circuit complexity of the clique function is exponential, thus showing that P = NP.\nIn this paper, we will first present some definitions and some prior work that Sima uses in his argument. We will then present Sima's argument and describe where Sima's argument fails due to making an improper generalization and failing to consider the connection between a Boolean variable and its negation. Finally we will provide an example that demonstrates the hole in his algorithm.",
        "Equids are prey animals by nature, showing as few signs of pain as possible to avoid predators [1] . In domesticated horses, the instinct to hide pain is still present and the presence of humans may disrupt ongoing pain behavior [2] . Further, recognizing pain is inherently subjective and time consuming, and is therefore currently challenging for both horse owners and equine veterinarian experts. An accurate automatic pain detection method therefore has large potential to increase animal welfare.\nOrthopedic disorders are frequent in horses and are, although treatable if detected early, one of the most common causes for euthanasia [3] [4] [5] . The pain displayed by the horse may be subtle and infrequent, which may leave the injury undetected.\nPain is a complex multidimensional experience with sensory and affective components. The affective component is associated with changes of behaviour, to avoid pain or to protect the painful area [6] . While some of these behaviours may be directly related to the location of the painful area, such as lameness in orthopedic disorders and rolling in abdominal disorders [7] , other pain behaviours, such as facial expressions, are thought to be universal as means of communication of pain with conspecifics. Acute pain has a sudden onset and a distinct cause, such as inflammation, trauma, or ischemia [8, 9] and all these elements may be present in orthopedic pain in horses.\nRecognizing horse pain automatically from video requires a method for fine-grained action recognition, which can pick up subtle behavioral signals over long time, and further, the method should be possible to train using a small dataset. In many widely used datasets for action recognition [10] [11] [12] , specific objects and scenery may add class information. This is not the case in our scenario, since the only valid evidence present in the video are poses, movements and facial expressions of the horse.\nThe Something-Something dataset [13] was indeed collected for fine-grained recognition of action templates, but its action classes are short and atomic. Although the classes in the Diving48 and FineGym datasets [14, 15] are complex and require temporal modeling, the movements that constitute their classes are densely appearing in a continuous sequence during the video, contrary to video data showing horses under orthopedic pain with sparse expressions thereof.\nA further important complication is that the labels in the present scenario are inherently noisy, since the horse's subjective experience of pain can not be observed. Instead, pain induction and/or human pain ratings are used as proxy when labeling video recordings.",
        "D EEP Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made much progress in a wide variety of computer vision applications [1] - [4] . However, as the research advances, the depth of the networks has expanded from a few layers to hundreds of layers [5] - [8] . The huge number of parameters and the ultra-high computational complexity of CNNs make their deployment very constrained, especially under the conditions of applications with high real-time requirements or limited storage capacity. To solve this problem, various compression techniques for CNNs have emerged. Network pruning [9] - [11] reduces model redundancy by pruning convolutional kernels or channels, efficient architecture design [12] - [14] replaces conventional convolutional layers with well-designed lightweight modules to speed up network inference, knowledge distillation [15] , [16] attempts to transfer knowledge from complex networks (teachers) to compact networks (students), quantization [17] - [22] replaces 32-bit weights and activations with lowbit (e.g., 16 -bit) ones to reduce both memory footprint and computational complexity. The extreme of quantization is binarization. Compared with 32-bit floating-point networks, network binarization constrains both the weights and activations to {-1, +1}, i.e., the parameters of binary neural networks (BNNs) need only 1-bit representation, which greatly reduces the storage requirement; furthermore, while binarizing the network weights and activations, the computationally intensive matrix multiplication and addition operations in full-precision networks are replaced with low-cost XNOR and bitcount, which greatly reduces the network inference delay. Therefore, benefiting from the high compression ratio, acceleration, and energy-saving, network binarization is considered as one of the most promising techniques for network compression and is the focus of this work.\nNetwork binarization has attracted a lot of attention due to its advantages in compression and acceleration. Although much progress has been made, the existing binarization methods still suffer from a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. For example, XNOR-Net [23] and Bi-Real Net [24] have improved the accuracy of BNNs with negligible extra computation, there remains a large accuracy gap between them and the full-precision counterparts; whereas Group-Net [25] and MeliusNet [26] achieve comparable accuracy to that of full-precision networks, but they introduce a noticeable additional computational cost, which significantly offsets the advantages of network binarization. Therefore, one of the motivations for this work is to strike a better trade-off between the accuracy and computational complexity for BNNs.\nIn addition, the performance degradation of BNNs is mainly caused by their limited representational capability.",
        "Fueled by the rise of machine learning applications in Internet of Things, federated learning (FL) (McMahan et al. 2017; Imteaj et al. 2022) has become an emerging paradigm that allows a large number of workers to produce a global model without sharing local data. The task of coordinating between workers is fulfilled by a central server that aggregates models received from workers at each round and broadcasts updated models to them. However, this parameter-server (PS) based scheme has a major drawback for the need of a central server (Kairouz et al. 2019) . In practice, the communication occurs between the server and workers leads to a quite large communication burden for the server (Lian et al. 2017) , and the server could face system failure or attacks, which may leak users' privacy or jeopardize the training process.\nWith this regard, consensus-based decentralized learning has recently emerged as a promising method, where each worker maintains a local copy of the model and embraces peer-to-peer communication for faster convergence (Lian et al. 2017 (Lian et al. , 2018)) . In decentralized learning, workers follow a communication graph to reach a so-called consensus model.\nHowever, like conventional PS framework, one of the most important challenges in decentralized learning is the issue of data heterogeneity, where the data distribution among workers may vary to a large extent. As a result, if all workers learn a single shared model with parameter w, the resulting model could perform poorly on many of individual workers. To this end, personalized decentralized learning (Vanhaesebrouck, Bellet, and Tommasi 2017; Dai et al. 2022 ) is important for achieving personalized models for each worker i with parameter w i instead of using a single shared model.\nIn this paper, we take a further step towards personalized decentralized learning. In particular, we take advantage of common representation among workers. This is inspired by observations in centralized learning, which suggest that heterogeneous data distributed across tasks (e.g., image classification) may share a common (low-dimensional) representation despite having different labels (Bengio, Courville, and Vincent 2013; LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015) . To our best knowledge, Collins et al. (2021) is the first to leverage this insight to design personalized PS based scheme, while we generalize it to decentralized setting. Specifically, we consider the setting in which all workers' model parameters share a common map, coupled with a personalized map that fits their local data. Formally, the parameter for worker i's model can be represented as w i = \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 i \u2022 \u03d5 \u03d5 \u03d5, where \u03d5 \u03d5 \u03d5 : R d \u2192 R z is a shared global representation1 which maps d-dimensional data points to a lower space of size z, and \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 i : R z \u2192 Y is the worker specific local head which maps from the lower dimensional subspace to the space of labels. Typically z \u226a d and thus given any fixed representation \u03d5 \u03d5 \u03d5, the worker specific heads \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 i are easy to optimize locally. Though Collins et al. (2021) provided a rigorous analysis with linear global representation, the following important questions remain open:\nDoes there exist a personalized, fully decentralized algorithm that can solve the optimization problem min \u03d5 \u03d5 \u03d5\u2208\u03a6 1 N N i=1 min \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8i\u2208\u0398 F i (\u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 i \u2022\u03d5 \u03d5 \u03d5), where F i (\u2022) is the loss function associated with worker i? Can we provide a convergence analysis for such a personalized, decentralized algo-rithm under general non-linear representations?\nIn this paper, we provide affirmative answers to these questions. We propose a fully decentralized algorithm named DePRL with alternating updates between global representation and local head parameters to solve the above optimization. At each round, each worker performs one or more steps of stochastic gradient descent to update its local head and global representation from its side.",
        "Modelling long-range sequences is a fundamental component in solving many real-world challenges, with aplications ranging from processing biosignals such as electroencephalograms spanning tens of thousands of time steps [Tang et al., 2023] , to comprehending and potentially writing large documents (e.g., novels, scientific papers) using large language models [Zhou et al., 2023 , Liu et al., 2023] .\nDeep learning methods have established themselves as state-of-the-art solutions for numerous challenging tasks, including learning functions defined over variable-length input sequences. Recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures emerged early on as strong contenders for this purpose. They compress sequences by incorporating input elements one at a time, using only O(1) operations with respect to the sequence length to process each input token and sharing parameters between time steps (Figure 1a ). Notably, RNNs are partially inspired by cognitive and neurological computational principles [Lipton et al., 2015] . Hence, perhaps unsurprisingly, they also underpin another class of biologically grounded architectures -spiking neural networks (SNNs) (Figure 1b ). SNNs process sequences using simplified mathematical models of biological neurons that relay internal computations using sparse patterns of binary spikes [Maass, 1997] . The aim is to emulate the brain's efficient neural coding, which enables computing with a fraction of the energy required by modern von Neumann machines [Hasler, 2017] .\nRNNs are affected by vanishing and exploding gradients [Pascanu et al., 2013] , stemming from unstable recurrent weight initialisation and the use of backpropagation through time (BPTT) (Figure 1a ). These phenomena hinder learning long-range dependencies in RNNs, and while they can be mitigated to some extent by gating mechanisms such as long short-term memory (LSTM) [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] , they difficult to eliminate entirely. In addition, traditional RNNs apply nonlinearities at each time step (\u03c3 in Figure 1a ), which requires iterative computations. This approach is non-problematic at inference, where input sequence elements are unknown ahead of time. However, RNN forward passes become prohibitively slow at training time for long sequences, since they cannot take advantage of GPU parallelisation, owing to the nonlinear state propagation [Yarga and Wood, 2023 , Orvieto et al., 2023 , Kalchbrenner et al., 2016] .\nAdditional challenges arise in SNN learning, as binary spiking is non-differentiable, which prohibits training SNNs directly with backpropagation. One solution is to train an artificial neural network (ANN) and then convert its continuous activations to spikes [Diehl et al., 2015] . However, this approach introduces additional latency during inference and is often prone to excessive firing, which can damage the energy efficiency of the network [Davidson and Furber, 2021] . Another solution is to train SNNs directly using surrogate gradients in the backward pass [Neftci et al., 2019] . Nevertheless, even with surrogate-based training, SNNs are still generally outperformed by ANNs such as LSTMs [Malcom and Casco-Rodriguez, 2023] .\nThe RNN limitations mentioned above are overcome by the Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] , which directly compresses the context for each token by measuring its relationship to all other elements (Figure 1c ). Besides improving performance, the Transformer's core component, self-attention, can be easily parallelised through GPU-friendly matrix multiplication, which accelerates training relative to RNNs [Zeyer et al., 2019] . Consequently, Transformer blocks have been crucial in establishing the current golden age of ever-larger pre-trained models [Min et al., 2023] .\nThe parallel and dense matrix multiplications that have entrenched the Transformer as arguably the de facto standard in sequence modelling also accentuated the structural differences between SNNs and ANNs. SNNs are built for deployment on neuromorphic computing platforms such as Intel Loihi [Davies et al., 2021] , which can potentially enable orders of magnitude lower energy consumption compared to traditional computers. These efficiencies are partly supported by representing information as sparse events identified by their address.",
        "The 28-day compressive strength is one of the most widely accepted metrics to characterize concrete's performance for engineering applications. Indeed, although this standardized yet simple index is primarily used to evaluate the ultimate strength of concrete mixtures [1] , it can also serve as an expedient measure to infer other critical mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, stiffness, or tensile strength [2] . Accurate strength predictions in concrete design have a profound impact on the efficiency and quality of construction projects. Indeed, for instance, an insufficient concrete strength can be the culprit of a catastrophic failure of civil infrastructures. Conversely, concretes exhibiting an overdesigned strength leads not only to higher material expenses [3] , but also to additional environmental burdens-such as CO2 emissions in cement production [4] .\nOver the past decades, a substantial amount of effort has been devoted to developing predictive models for correlating a given concrete mixture proportion to its associated strength performance [5] . Beyond this, an ideal predictive model also provides important insights for designing new concrete with better constructability and durability, and/or at a lower cost [6, 7] . Conventional approaches often seek to achieve these goals using physics or chemistry-based relationships [8] [9] [10] . Although the role played by major proportioning parameters (e.g., water-to-cementitious ratio, w/cm, aggregate fraction, and air void content) has been extensively investigated, the influence of many other factors is not always negligible, e.g., chemical and mineral admixtures or aggregates gradation [11] . Due to the limited understanding of these complex property-strength correlations, it is still extremely challenging to get a robust and universal concrete strength model using conventional approaches [12] .\nAs an alternative pathway, the recent development of machine learning (ML) techniques provides a novel data-driven approach to revisit the strength prediction problem. Importantly, MLbased predictions have been shown to significantly outperform those of conventional approaches, especially when handling non-linear problems [13] . Without the need for any physical or chemical presumptions, this new approach also further permits greater flexibility to extract hidden, nonintuitive feature patterns directly from the input data. As such, recent studies have established ML as a promising approach to predict concrete strength [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, a major limitation of ML approaches lies in the fact that a large dataset is usually required for ML algorithms to \"learn\" the relationship between inputs and outputs [18, 19] . This is a major concern for concrete strength applications, as strength data for industrial concretes are often difficult to access (i.e., data is not publicly available). In addition, reported concrete strength data are often incomplete, that is, some important features are often missing, e.g., curing temperature, additives, types of aggregates, etc.",
        "Person Re-identification (ReID), i.e., retrieval of the same person captured by multiple cameras, has attracted tremendous attention from academia and industry [19, 30, 33, 35, 42, 43] . Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have significantly improved the accuracy of person ReID, we still cannot completely trust the results produced by black-box models, especially for critical scenarios [44] . Therefore, this paper is focused on the interpretation of CNN-based person ReID models which is crucial yet rarely studied.\nIn recent years, there has been a surge of work in discovering how a target CNN processes input images and makes predictions [10, 24, 47] . These methods usually visualize gradients or salient regions on feature maps w.r.t. the input image and its prediction [4, 8, 24, 25, 26, 47] . Particularly, Chen et al. [5] proposed to explain neural networks semantically and quantitatively by decomposing the prediction made by CNNs into semantic concepts by knowledge distillation. However, these methods mainly consider clas-sification problems. They cannot be directly applied to person ReID, which is an open-set retrieval task and usually solved by metric learning [43, 46] .\nA CNN-based ReID system usually maps a query image and gallery images into a metric space, then outputs pairwise distances by which a rank list of gallery images is returned, as shown in Figure 1 (a). Although Yang et al. [37] proposed Ranking Activation Maps which could visualize related regions of two persons, it still cannot semantically explain why they are similar or not. Attributes, e.g., colors and types of clothes, shoes, etc., are semantically understandable for humans and have been exploited as mid-level features for person ReID [18] , but there is no method using attributes for explanations of person ReID. Therefore, we aim to learn an interpreter with the help of semantic attributes for answering two questions: 1) what attributes make two persons different, and 2) how much impact each attribute contributes to the difference, as shown in Figure 1 (b). In real applications, the interpreter not only can help users focus on the most discrepant attributes of two persons but also can assist developers to improve the accuracy of ReID models, as shown in Figure 1 (c) .\nHowever, interpretation of ReID models with attributes faces unique challenges. Firstly, since the output of ReID models are distances of pairwise images, it is difficult to use class activation or gradients to visualize salient regions or disentangle semantics as classification [24, 47] .",
        "Subscriber identity module (SIM) is the secure element in a mobile phone or device that contains the identifiers and cryptographic credentials with which the user equipment (UE) authenticates the mobile subscriber to the mobile network operator (MNO). For a long time, the SIM has been a miniature smart card that is inserted into the mobile device, and by changing the SIM, it has been possible to use the same device for different mobile subscribers and networks. However, in new mobile devices, the removable SIM is being replaced by the embedded SIM (eSIM). It is a secure element integrated into the circuit board of the mobile device, and it can be programmed with SIM profiles that contain the identifiers and credentials.\nRemote SIM provisioning (RSP) [32] is the protocol specified by the GSM Association (GSMA) for the purpose of downloading and installing SIM profiles into the secure element. Remote SIM provisioning reduces the logistical and production costs, and it gives subscribers the flexibility of changing operators online [56] . There are two variants of the RSP protocol: the machine-to-machine (M2M) version [33, 34] is used in remotely controllable devices, and the consumer version [35, 36] is used in consumer devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables. These two protocol variants differ in how much participation is expected from the end users. The M2M variant does not need interaction with the end user for SIM profile management. In contrast, the consumer RSP protocol requires the end user to trigger the management operations such as remote provisioning, enabling, disabling, and deletion of SIM profiles on the mobile device.\nThe SIM profile contains security-critical information such as the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) and subscriber key \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc56 , which is a shared secret between the UE and the MNO. The UE uses these credentials from the SIM profile in the authentication and key agreement (AKA) procedure to enable the subscriber's access to the mobile network [2] . Thus, the secure delivery of the SIM profile to the mobile device is of the utmost importance.\nUnwanted exposure or tampering of the SIM profile or the credentials within it could lead to identity theft, billing fraud, eavesdropping, and various privacy violations against the mobile subscriber. In one documented security failure [51] , the attackers captured credentials of SIM profiles by penetrating the internal networks of a SIM manufacturer. In another case [45] , the attackers were able to carry out memory-exhaustion attacks against the secure element using flaws in the M2M RSP protocol. These attacks highlight the importance of careful design and analysis for the RSP protocols.\nThis paper investigates the security of the consumer RSP protocol.",
        "In today's technology-driven society, it has become increasingly essential to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary for active civic engagement and addressing societal issues critically, utilizing computing as a tool. Among these skills, computer science proficiency stands out as an essential competency applicable across various disciplines, careers, and civic contexts (Bers, 2019; Stamatios, 2022; Resnick & Rusk, 2020) . With the \"Computer Science For All\" initiative, there has been a growing implementation of computer science courses in K-12 education (Goode et al., 2018; Ladner & Israel, 2016) . Additionally, as we face unprecedented climate challenges, environmental awareness and knowledge have become more crucial than ever. Efforts at international, national, and state levels have aimed to enhance environmental science education. For example, California has been committed to fostering environmental literacy throughout K-12 education, spearheaded by the California Department of Education (Lieberman, 2017) . The United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development similarly focuses on providing individuals with quality education to instill the behaviors necessary for sustainability (Biswas, 2020) . Equipping students with environmental knowledge and awareness can inspire them to take responsible actions and commit to addressing environmental issues (Biswas, 2020 ). An integrated curriculum combining computer science and environmental science has the potential to enrich students' skills in both fields. This integration of computer science into other subjects not only enhances students' learning experiences but also cultivates their computing and computational thinking abilities (Fascali et al., 2018) . Furthermore, computer programming can serve as a powerful tool for creating innovative content that engages students in addressing societal issues and teaching scientific concepts (Yu et al., 2020) . In this context, students are not merely learning to code but using coding to facilitate their learning of other academic skills, including critical thinking, problem-solving, and social skills (Popat & Starkey, 2019) . Coding enables students to create projects that convey their stories and ideas, employing innovative features such as animation, audio, games, and images to emphasize their messages. For example, students have developed Scratch animations to address issues like racism, and teachers have utilized Scratch to teach the butterfly life cycle through animations (Resnick & Rusk, 2020) .",
        "While resources for pre-training language models for the Hebrew language continue to grow, mainly thanks to multi-lingual datasets scraped for multi-lingual model training, Hebrew resources for downstream tasks remain scarce. While tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering received some attention (Amram et al., 2018) , (Bareket and Tsarfaty, 2021) , (Cohen et al., 2023) , tasks such as summarization remain fairly untouched.\nA close relative of the summarization task is conclusion extraction. While in summarization we are interested in extracting or generating spans that capture the context best, in conclusion extraction we are interested in extracting a higher logical knowledge level which merges the context with a prior knowledge of the author.\nWhile most extractive summarization datasets can be best described as \"take the first and last paragraph and you are good to go\", for example, the CNN/Daily Mail dataset (Nallapati et al., 2016) , a general purpose extractive summarization use-case is more similar to the WikiHow dataset (Koupaee and Wang, 2018) , in which the extractive span is interwoven throughout the context.\nContinuing the line established in (Shalumov and Haskey, 2023) , we sought to extend the Hebrew NLP resources for both standard-length documents and long documents with emphasis on tasks with scarce resources. To that purpose, we turned to the State Comptroller and Ombudsman of Israel reports2 .\nThe State Comptroller and Ombudsman of Israel reports describe periodic State audits. State audit applies to a broad range of bodies from the public sector, among which are government ministries, State institutions, local authorities, statutory corporations, government companies, and additional agencies.\nDuring the course of this work, these reports were processed to obtain two datasets: The first is an abstractive summarization dataset MevakerSumm which contains the context of the audit and its abstractive summary. The second is an extractive conclusions dataset MevakerConc which contains the context of the audit, the offsets of conclusions as marked by the auditors and the conclusions text contained within the offsets.\nOne of the goals of this paper is not only to provide additional datasets to the research community but also to provide additional models for scarcely researched tasks. Thus, we focused on two main tasks -Conclusion Extraction and Conclusion Allocation. To facilitate training the appropriate models, we synthesized two auxiliary datasets from Mevak-erConc: The MevakerConcSen dataset in which each sample contains a sentence, a label whether this sentence is a part of the conclusion, and a topic from which it was harvested. The second auxiliary dataset named Mevak-erConcTree is built for the conclusion allocation training process.\nFollowing the synthesis of the datasets, we trained several classifiers for conclusion extraction.",
        "Coordinating conjunctions are a common syntactic phenomenon in English: 38.8% of sentences in the Penn Tree Bank have at least one coordinating word between \"and\", \"or\", and \"but\" (Marcus et al., 1993) . Conjunctions add complexity to the sentences, thereby making inferences over such sen-tences more realistic and challenging. A sentence can have many conjunctions, each conjoining two or more conjuncts of varied syntactic categories such as noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases, clauses, etc. Besides syntax, conjunctions in English have a lot of semantics associated to them and different conjunctions (\"and\" vs \"or\") affect the meaning of a sentence differently.\nRecent years have seen significant progress in the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI) through the development of large-scale datasets like SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) . Although large-scale pre-trained language models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) have achieved super-human performances on these datasets, there have been concerns raised about these models exploiting idiosyncrasies in the data using tricks like pattern matching (McCoy et al., 2019) . Thus, various stress-testing datasets have been proposed that probe NLI models for simple lexical inferences (Glockner et al., 2018) , quantifiers (Geiger et al., 2018) , numerical reasoning, antonymy and negation (Naik et al., 2018) . However, despite the heavy usage of conjunctions in English, there is no specific NLI dataset that tests their understanding in detail. Although SNLI has 30% of samples with conjunctions, most of these examples do not require inferences over the conjuncts that are connected by the coordinating word. On a random sample of 100 conjunctive examples from SNLI, we find that 72% of them have the conjuncts unchanged between the premise and the hypothesis (e.g., \"Man and woman sitting on the sidewalk\" \u2192 \"Man and woman are sitting\") and there are almost no examples with non-boolean conjunctions (e.g., \"A total of five men and women are sitting.\" \u2192 \"A total of 5 men are sitting.\" (contradiction)). As discussed below, inference over conjuncts directly translates to boolean and non- He is a Worcester resident and a member of the Republican Party. contradiction 4 A total of 793880 acre, or 36 percent of the park was affected by the wildfires.\nA total of 793880 acre, was affected by the wildfires. entailment 5 Its total running time is 9 minutes and 9 seconds, spanning seven tracks.\nIts total running time is 9 minutes, spanning seven tracks. boolean semantics and thus becomes essential for understanding conjunctions.\nIn our work, we introduce CONJNLI, a new stress-test for NLI over diverse and challenging conjunctive sentences. Our dataset contains annotated examples where the hypothesis differs from the premise by either a conjunct removed, added or replaced. These sentences contain single and multiple instances of coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, nor) with quantifiers, negations, and requiring diverse boolean and non-boolean inferences over conjuncts. Table 1 shows many examples from CONJNLI and compares these with typical conjunctive examples from SNLI and MNLI. In the first two examples, the conjunct \"a Worcester resident\" is removed and added, while in the third example, the other conjunct \"a member of the Democratic Party\" is replaced by \"a member of the Republican Party\". Distribution over conjuncts in a conjunctive sentence forms multiple simple sentences. For example, the premise in the first example of Table 1 can be broken into \"He is a Worcester resident.\" and \"He is a member of the Democratic Party.\". Correspondingly, from boolean semantics, it requires an inference of the form \"A and B \u2192 A\". Likewise, the third example is of the form \"A and B \u2192 A and C\". While such inferences are rather simple from the standpoint of boolean logic, similar rules do not always translate to English, e.g., in non-boolean cases, i.e., an inference of the form \"A and B \u2192 A\" is not always entailment or an inference of the form \"A or B \u2192 A\" is not always neutral (Hoeksema, 1988) . Consider the three examples marked with a \u2020 in Table 1 showing non-boolean usages of \"and\", \"or\" and \"but\" in English. In the fifth example, the total time is a single entity and cannot be separated in an entailed hypothesis.2 In the sixth example, \"or\" is used as \"exclusive-or\" because the person began recording in either 1889 or 1890.",

Furthermore, the availability of numerical examples of P X may also guide theoretical work by pointing out possible properties of P X that we might want to prove.",
        "In semi-supervised learning, the most important challenge is how to effectively utilize unlabeled data. Consistency [3, 37, 39] and contrastive learning [16, 6] are two popular strategies. For image classification, given augmented views of unlabeled images (Fig. 1 ), consistency learning enforces different views of the same image to have similar features, whereas contrastive learning encourages the network output of a certain image to be dissimilar to all but those of the same image.\nSemi-supervised semantic segmentation, the problem studied in this paper, requires rich and robust supervision on unlabeled data. By minimizing feature distance for pixels from the same location in different views, consistency learning [11, 36, 32] establishes very reliable supervision signals. However, this approach does not provide sufficiently abundant supervision, as it ignores relationships with pixels in different locations. Contrastive learning [51, 53, 52, 29, 1] , on the other hand, employs ample pairwise supervision by promoting (punishing) feature similarities of positive (negative) pixel pairs. Nonetheless, deciding binary positive-negative assignments can be non-trivial. First, if we treat each pixel as a distinct class [42, 51] as done in image classification, the neighboring pixels would be forced to have dissimilar features. This is clearly undesirable because these pixels usually describe the same object and are strongly correlated. Second, some works use pseudo labels to decide pixel semantics and in turn assign binary positive-negative pairs [53, 52, 1, 29] , but this process is often hindered by the noisy nature of pseudo labels. Small errors in pseudo labels may reverse the binary positive-negative pair assignment, completely overturning feature similarity supervision.\nTo obtain rich and robust supervision, we propose multi-view correlation consistency (MVCC) learning, which achieves state-of-the-art results in multiple settings. In a nutshell, we introduce a correlation consistency loss to enforce self-correlation matrices to be similar between views (Fig. 1 ). Compared to consistency learning, our method computes similarities between a much greater number of pixel pairs and thus benefits from a richer description of the data distribution. Compared with contrastive learning, importantly, pixel-pixel similarity no longer increases (decreases) according to the positive (negative) assignment; instead, it is supervised by the similarity of the same pixel pair in another augmented view.",
        "Decision trees are ubiquitous in the machine learning community due to their model interpretability and flexibility to describe relations in the data. Many areas, for example in clinical settings, prioritise such models due to the straightforward connection between the final model and the original dataset.\nA standard decision tree defines a set of ordered splits that are applied sequentially to the data. The traditional approach to learning a decision tree is via a greedy one-step ahead heuristic. One of the most popular of such methods is known as CART [3] which gives the output predicted by a tree model as a point-estimate.\nRecently, research has focused on probabilistic approaches to learning these models [9] , since they offer quantification of model uncertainty. Within this broad class of approaches, Bayesian inference has proven effective but comes with added complexity in computing the required distributions. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are commonly used in Bayesian inference to approximate the desired probability distribution using the law of large numbers [25] , whose convergence rate depends on how uncorrelated the samples are. The performance of these methods is therefore directly related to the quality of the samples in the chain -where quality relates to both how uncorrelated the chain is and that the samples are in areas of high likelihood. The effectiveness of MCMC methods is critically linked to the quality of samples from the Markov chain, and while attempts have been made, providing quality samples remains an open challenge and is the primary focus of this paper.\nThe central difficulty is that the tree structure must be explored along with the other tree parameters. This is challenging for MCMC methods because the problem dimension changes with the tree structure, a quality referred to as transdimensional. Exploring the posterior of Bayesian decision trees was first investigated in Buntine [4] , which showed that using a Bayesian averaging and smoothing approach often produced more accurate predictions than heuristic approaches. Shortly thereafter, a stochastic sampling method based on MCMC techniques was independently proposed by Chipman et al. [5] and Denison et al. [6] , both of which developed a set of tree-inspired moves (i.e. grow, prune, change and swap) to transition from one tree to the next, with each tree constituting a new sample in the chain. This again saw an improvement in the accuracy of the trees that were visited, including some with better predictive ability than standard non-Bayesian methods.\nFurther developments in the area witnessed additions and improvements made to the original set of tree-inspired moves within the MCMC framework. In particular, Wu et al. [26] introduced a new type of move, referred to as the 'radical restructure'. Gramacy and Lee [10] used binary search tree theory to propose an improved version of the original swap move. Pratola et al. [20] then generalised this improved swap move to a broader range of scenarios, in addition to improving on the original change move.\nStochastic exploration has also been tackled using a different method for sampling candidate decision trees called Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). In contrast to MCMC methods, where a single tree is altered at every iteration, SMC works by sequentially changing a set of particles at every iteration and weighting based on the likelihood, where in this case each of these particles represents a decision tree. This solution was first investigated by Taddy et al. [24] in the context of an increasing number of data observations, where the decision tree was changed locally based on the location of the new datapoint. Lakshminarayanan et al. [14] applied SMC to construct a Bayesian decision tree by instead using the entire dataset and proposing locally optimal moves.",
        "Ever since the transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) revolutionized natural language processing research (Brown et al., 2020; Devlin et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2020) , significant attention has been paid to the quadratic cost of increasing sequence length. While traditional academic benchmarks tend to not require sequence lengths beyond 4096, many real-world applications such as multi-round chat (Team, 2023; Yao et al., 2023) , biological sequence modeling (Ahdritz et al., 2022; Avsec et al., 2021; Dalla-Torre et al., 2023; Jumper et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2022) , and analyzing computer programs (Alam et al., 2023a; Muennighoff et al., 2023; Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023) do. The unique challenges, data, and sequence dynamics that occur within each application can have a significant effect on what techniques work well, which is not well elucidated within the current Transformer literature.\nIn this paper we are concerned with malware classification using byte-level representations of executables (Raff and Nicholas, 2017b) , a task that can require sequence lengths of up to 200 million in common realworld scenarios. Though we are not able to process this extreme length in its entirety, we focus on it as an important research direction to test and develop algorithms for long-sequence task modeling.",
        "Since the introduction of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in 2010 [1] , the technology has become widely adopted in smartphones, wearables, and other IoT devices. In a modern household, there can be more than a dozen devices that supporting this technology. They are constantly sending BLE advertisements to inform devices in their surrounding about their presence but typically without the owner noticing. Most recently, BLE has been proposed to be used BLE advertisements pose a vast surface for privacy-compromising attacks. In the past, several researchers found that BLE advertisements may contain fixed identifiers that allow for device tracking despite MAC address randomization [6] and could contain personally identifiable information about the user such as their phone number or email address [9] . Besides, an adversary might place a tracking device based on BLE, such as the rumored Apple AirTags [4] , in a person's pocket and leverage a crowd-sourced finder network to track their target. In essence, BLE devices share potentially sensitive data with devices in proximity. To improve our understanding of the (privacy-related) attack surface at large, e. g., by analyzing privacy leaks or detecting malicious devices, we as a security community require better application support.\nWe propose BTLEmap (pronounce as beetle map), a network discovery and security auditing tool in the spirit of Nmap [5] but for BLE environments. Currently, BTLEmap supports device enumeration, advertisement dissection, rudimentary device fingerprinting, a proximity view, and more.",
        "Hydropower plants (HPPs) are a key renewable generation asset, covering more than 10% of the electricity needs in Europe [1] . Meanwhile, the increasing proportion of stochastic renewable generation in the power grid causes increasing regulation duties for conventional generation assets, including HPPs. Excessive regulation duties are a concern for HPP operators because they lead to increased wear and tear, ultimately shortening service life and requiring expensive maintenance. The need to counteract these effects has been very recently recognized in funded research projects (e.g., [2] ) and addressed in recent technical literature. E.g., work [3] has shown that medium-head HPPs providing ancillary services incur in larger penstock fatigue, and authors of [4] proposed a method to reduce it. As an alternative to extending regulation duties of HPPs, the use of batteries was proposed in so-called hybrid HPPs to increment the regulation capacity, e.g., [5] .\nConventional HPP regulation loops include the droop governors for primary frequency regulation, the speed changer for secondary frequency control, and the turbine governor. The governor parameters are typically tuned to deliver the design performance (e.g., response time and droop) while respecting the plant's static mechanical and power limits. These classical feedback control loops do not model dynamic mechanical loads explicitly, so they are unaware of possible wear and tear effects that excessive regulation causes. Modeling the This research was supported by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program in the context of the Hydropower Extending Power System Flexibility project (XFLEX HYDRO, grant agreement No 857832). mechanical stress is relevant not only for wear and tear but also to design stress-informed splitting policies for the control signal in plants with multiple controllable elements, like hybrid HPPs.\nAn alternative to classical regulation loops to develop informed control decisions is model predictive control (MPC), which uses models to formulate constraints explicitly, as for example done in [6] for battery systems using linear prediction models of the battery voltage. In this spirit, this paper proposes linear models of the HPP that can be implemented into an MPC problem to formulate suitable operational constraints of the plant. Two linear models are proposed: a guide vane-totorque model (key to model the plant's power output) and a guide vane-to-head model, which is essential to characterize mechanical loads and fatigue.",
        "Image style transfer aims to automatically transfer the artistic style from a source style image to a given content one, and has been studied for a long time in the computer vision community. Conventionally, image style transfer is generally cast as the problem of non-photorealistic rendering in the domain of computer graphics. Inspired by the success of deep learning [9, 41, 8, 55, 10] , Gatys et al. [11] pioneer the paradigm that leverages the feature activations from deep Fig. 1 . Existing parametric [14, 1, 30] and non-parametric [6, 42] NST methods either barely transfer the global style appearance to the target [6] , or produce distorted local style patterns [14, 1, 30] and undesired artifacts [42] . By contrast, the proposed GNN-based semi-parametric approach achieves superior stylization performance in the transfers of both global stroke arrangement and local fine-grained patterns.\nfrom deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract and match the target content and style, leading to the benefits of no explicit restrictions on style types and no requirements of ground-truth training data. As such, various CNN-based style transfer methods are developed in the literature [22, 25, 5, 49, 47, 15, 13] , establishing a novel field of neural style transfer (NST) [18] .\nState-of-the-art NST algorithms can be categorized into two streams of methods, parametric and non-parametric ones, depending on the style representation mechanisms. In particular, parametric NST approaches rely on the global summary statistics over the entire feature map from pre-trained deep CNNs to extract and match the target artistic style [11, 21, 14] . Non-parametric neural methods, also known as patch-based NST methods [6, 42] , leverage the local feature patches to represent the style information, inspired by the conventional patch-based texture modeling approaches with Markov random fields. The idea is to swap the content neural patches with the most similar style ones, through a greedy one-to-one patch matching strategy.\nBoth parametric and non-parametric methods, unfortunately, have their own limitations, as demonstrated in Fig. 1 . Parametric stylization methods achieve good performance in transferring the overall appearance of the style images, but are incompetent in generating fine-grained local style patterns. By contrast, nonparametric style transfer algorithms allow for locally-aligned stylization; however, such patch-based methods are typically accomplished with the undesired artifacts due to content-style mismatching.\nIn this paper, we present a semi-parametric style transfer scheme, towards alleviating the dilemmas of existing parametric and non-parametric methods. On the one hand, our semi-parametric approach allows for the establishment of more accurate many-to-one correspondences between di erent content and style regions in a learnable manner. As such, our approach explicitly tackles the issue of content-style mismatching in non-parametric NST algorithms, thereby largely alleviating the deficiency of unplausible artifacts. On the other hand, the proposed semi-parametric method adaptively divides content and style features into tiny and cross-scale feature patches for stylization, thus addressing the dilemma of lacking local details in prior parametric schemes.",
        "The proliferation of data, resulting from the continuous increase in IoT (Internet of Things) device deployments, has resulted in the emergence of cloud data storage and associated processing services. Centralized cloud solutions are considered insufficient for novel applications such as holographic communications with strict requirements, including low delay and high bandwidth. As a complementary solution, edge computing brings cloud services closer to users and allows different edge devices to run heterogeneous applications that use and produce all data types. Thus, prominent solutions are required for moving data, storing it, and processing it throughout the Edge-Cloud continuum and in between. Therefore, a seamless cooperation between computing, caching, and communication (3C) is essential. Recent studies (see Table I ) have focused on this collaboration mainly at the edge, addressing the management of 3C resources and ignoring an essential factor that the network can no longer be considered as a bare data transport medium.\nWith recent advances in network virtualization and softwarization, seamless 3C collaboration will be possible at points between edge and cloud [1] . In particular, In-Network Computing (INC) has emerged as a new paradigm in which network core infrastructures do not just transmit data but also act on it (e.g., perform computation and caching). INC refers to the offloading of application-specific tasks from the end-host to the programmable network devices (e.g., programmable switch, Smart Network Interface Card (NIC)). Since INC performs computing inside the network, the transaction terminates within the path, thereby avoiding unpredictable latency in the communication path. Besides benefiting from the pipeline design of network devices, INC offers higher orders of magnitude in terms of throughput processing capacity than can be achieved by an end-host server. The rapid evolution of Programmable Network Devices (PND) such as Barefoot Tofino switches [2] facilitate data plane programmability to perform computer-like functions such as data aggregation, task scheduling, and traffic classification in the network. Thus, INC is becoming another pillar of technological enablers -network computerization -towards seamless 3C collaboration in the Edge-Cloud Continuum.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature examining the synergy between INC and 3Cs. We provide a systematic analysis of how current research addresses developments and contributions made in INC and builds an implicit layer supporting 3C cooperation in the cloud-Edge continuum.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows.\n\u2022 An overview of today's distributed computing landscape and related services is given. \u2022 An extensive description of in-network computing, including a taxonomy, technological enablers, and implementation techniques, is provided. \u2022 A detailed analysis of several use cases emphasizes the need for in-network computing to meet the stringent requirements of emerging applications.",
        "Policy gradient methods represent a large and popular class of reinforcement learning algorithms (Schulman et al., 2015 (Schulman et al., , 2017) ) to tackle the set of applications with continuous action spaces, where methods such as Q-learning cannot be directly applied. Robotics (Peters and Schaal, 2006) , emergent tool usage (Baker et al., 2020) , and games (OpenAI et al., 2019) are notable examples of successful applications for these methods. However, policy gradient methods are also notoriously sampleinefficient as they require collecting a large amount of on-policy experience after each parameter update (Gu et al., 2017) . This is the reason why they are most widely employed in applications where many instances of fast simulators are available.\nTo go beyond these simulation-based applications and towards real-world deployment, it is necessary to exploit the collected experience efficiently. One solution is to improve sample efficiency by leveraging all available experience. This translates into using off-policy samples, which, for instance, might be gathered by dedicated safe-to-deploy data collection policies, which we will refer to as behavioral policies. In the most general setting, off-policy learning aims at learning under arbitrary behavioral policies. A notable use case consists in learning from a mixture of on-and off-policy samples for example by using experience replay mechanisms (Lin, 1992) , hence avoiding discarding the experience collected when a policy gets updated. Off-policy policy gradient (OPPG) methods typically rely on a modified version of the on-policy objective function (Degris et al., 2012) , known as the excursion objective (Ghiassian et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) , that can be estimated from off-policy samples avoiding the use of importance sampling techniques, which are known to lead to high variance (Liu et al., 2018) . However, in general settings, there is no clear understanding of the mismatch between the two objectives.\nThe on-policy objective estimates returns achieved by a policy when deployed in the environment, while the off-policy objective, in general, does not describe actual returns achievable in the environment.",
        "Face recognition of vehicle occupants in unconstrained environments, particularly through the windshield, poses a number of challenges. Previous research has shown that artifacts introduced by a windshield can greatly impact a camera's ability to image within the vehicle interior. 1 Additionally, images captured in this scenario are typically from long distances and moderate speeds, which reduces the amount of light available to the sensor. Low-intensity ultraviolet or near-infrared (NIR) illumination has become increasingly ineffective in alleviating these issues as tinted windshields that block these wavelengths gain popularity. Likewise, increasing the exposure time cannot fix the problems associated with that since the vehicle is moving, and motion blur artifacts caused by increasing exposure time significantly degrades face recognition quality. Furthermore, windshields are reflective, which produces several unique challenges. First, it further reduces the light available to the sensors. Second, the windshield will reflect light from other sources into the sensor. If that light propagates directly from a light source, this will often cause obstructive glare (Figure 1 ). Even if that light is reflected off of an object onto the windshield, the object will appear as an unwanted artifact overlaid with the desired image of the driver.\nCurrent solutions for this problem include flashing visible lights at the driver, such as the system devised by Gatekeeper Security. 2 This is highly undesirable, as it both distracts the driver from safe vehicle operation and has the potential to cause obstructive glare due to the windshield.\nTo provide the best possible input to a deep learning algorithm, a custom multi-camera imaging system was developed to specifically mitigate these hurdles while remaining non-intrusive. 3 The system is modular in design, where each unit is composed of both an imaging system and an associated computational system, seen in Figures 2, 3 , and 4. The raw images captured by the system can subsequently be processed by any HDR method to ultimately provide the processed input to facial recognition software.",
        "Discovering new drugs to fulfill specific criteria, such as binding affinity towards a given molecular target, is a fundamental problem in chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry (Hughes et al., 2011) . In this work, we focus on an important subdomain: de novo biological sequence design. This task is challenging for two reasons: (1) the exploration space for sequences is combinatorially large; and (2) sequence usefulness is evaluated via a complicated process which usually involves time-consuming and expensive wet-lab experiments.\nDespite the difficulty of this task, many approaches have been developed over the past few decades thanks to recent advances in biochemistry and machine learning. The Nobel Prize wining paradigm, directed evolution (Chen & Arnold, 1991) , which conducts local evolutionary search under human guidance, is one of the popular techniques. Unfortunately, it is limited by its sample inefficiency and reliance on strong prior knowledge, e.g., about where to mutate (Ahn et al., 2020) . Furthermore, to compete with other machine learning methods (Gottipati et al., 2020) , guided evolution (Yoshikawa et al., 2018; Jensen, 2019; Nigam et al., 2019) heavily relies on human intuition for designing domain-specific evolutionary operators, which may not always apply to tasks at hand.\nIn this work, we deem sequence design to be a black-box optimization problem, tasked with maximizing an unknown oracle function. We assume that oracle queries are limited due to the constraint on resources, such as the budgets for evaluating queries in a wet-lab. Thus, sample efficiency is crucial. We develop a probabilistic framework by reformulating the aforementioned black-box optimization target as a posterior modeling problem. With this framework, we draw a surprising connection between likelihood-free inference and sequence design, and thus linking two fields which are previously considered as unrelated.",
        "Research in sign language has focused mainly on supervised learning with the aims of classifying phonological parameters (Liaw et al., 2002; Cooper and Bowden, 2007; Buehler et al., 2009; Buehler et al., 2010; Cooper et al., 2012; Koller et al., 2016) , providing glosses for isolated signs (Gaolin Fang et al., 2004; Ong et al., 2014; Fagiani et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2015; Mocialov et al., 2017a; Bantupalli and Xie, 2018; Tornay et al., 2019) , or translation of signed utterances that consist of multiple signs to written languages (Neidle and Vogler, 2012; S Kumar et al., 2018; Cihan Camgoz et al., 2018; Ko et al., 2019) .\nDespite the field being mainly approached with supervised methods, few attempts have been made to model sign language using unsupervised methods (Papapetrou et al., 2009; \u00d6stling et al., 2018) and these are mainly for data mining.\nThe aim of this work is to exploit sign language resources available on social media and cluster segmented phonemes without access to transcriptions during clustering. Two clustering methods are compared, one is the general DBSCAN clustering method (Witten and Frank, 2002) and another one is iterative grouping clustering method. Experiments show that it is possible to find similar phonemes in continuous signing data using clustering approach with linguistically liable distance metric based on phonological parameters.\n2 Related Work Deldjoo et al. (2016) build a recommendation system based on the extracted visual features from the videos, such as lighting, colour, and motion. Snoek et al. (2009) and Hu et al. (2011) identify colour, texture, shape, objects, and movements as features to serve as a basis for video indexing and retrieval. Furthermore, the extracted features can be grouped across the temporal dimension and used for querying similar groups during data mining. Other methods create specialised groups, such as human actions and can vary depending on the application. Unknown patterns within the groups are usually found through clustering. Karypis et al. (2000) identify bottom-up and top-down approaches to clustering. In the bottom-up approach, every element is assigned to an individual cluster and then clusters are merged in the iterative process. In the top-down approach, every element is in the same cluster and then the cluster is split into different clusters. The merging and splitting are done using a similarity metric with bottom-up approach being more common. Cluster quality can be assessed by measuring the inter-cluster entropy or relationship between the precision and recall. When no external information about the clusters is available, the inter-and intra-cluster cohesion can be used to evaluate the quality of the clusters (Corral et al., 2006) . Ert\u00f6z et al.",

Dynamic view synthesis techniques aim to create photorealistic novel views of dynamic scenes from arbitrary camera angles and points of view. These systems are essential for innovative applications such as video stabilization [33, 42] , virtual reality [7, 15] , and view interpolation [13, 85] , which enable free-viewpoint videos and let users interact with the video sequence. It facilitates downstream applications like virtual reality, virtual 3D teleportation, and 3D replays of live professional sports events.\nDynamic view synthesis systems typically rely on expensive and laborious setups, such as fixed multi-camera capture rigs [7, 10, 15, 50, 85] , which require simultaneous capture from multiple cameras.

        "In predictive modeling, the task is often to find a relation from X to Y, where both are matrices with N rows, each representing a sample. Each sample is associated with K predictors, making up the columns of X, and M observations making up the columns of Y. Instead of directly using X and Y, some models use one or both of the matrix products, X T X and X T Y.\nWe present three novel algorithms for substantially speeding up cross-validation requiring the computation of X T X and X T Y per dataset partition. X and Y are matrices with N rows, each representing a sample. X has K columns representing predictors of the samples, and Y has M columns representing observations of the samples. Our algorithms include the possibility of using the variants of X T X and X T Y where X and Y have been mean-centered and standard deviation-scaled on a per training set basis, avoiding data leakage from the corresponding validation sets.\nOur algorithms do not require recomputing the full X T X and X T Y for each training set in the cross-validation scheme, nor do they require recomputation of the statistical moments.\nOur algorithms can rapidly compute partition-wise, potentially mean-centered, and optionally sample standard deviation-scaled X T X and X T Y. These algorithms find valuable applications across various PLS-R [18, 19] and PLS-DA [3] algorithms. Particularly noteworthy is their seamless integration with the IKPLS algorithms [6] , known for their speed [1] and numerical stability [2] . Leveraging our cross-validation algorithms with IKPLS facilitates swift testing of diverse preprocessing methods within a condensed timeframe. Selecting the optimal preprocessing technique requires model validation [14, 16] and is imperative for achieving peak performance [7] .\nOur algorithms have the same asymptotic runtime of \u0398(N K (K + M ) ) as the cross-validation algorithm proposed in [13] in the simple case with no column-wise preprocessing and column-wise mean-centering case. In the case of column-wise standard deviation-scaling, our algorithm retains this runtime while the one proposed in [13] increases in runtime. Additionally, we use the training sets' statistical moments to avoid data leakage from the validation sets where [13] uses statistical moments computed on the entire dataset. Additionally, the space complexity of our algorithms is asymptotically lower than [13] by a factor P where P is the number of cross-validation partitions. Our algorithms' runtime and space complexity are entirely independent of the number of cross-validation partitions. Furthermore, we show how to derive the sample mean and standard deviation of the training sets from the sample mean and standard deviation of the entire dataset without requiring full recomputation.",
        "Conditional expressions are pivotal in representing knowledge and reasoning abilities of intelligent agents. Conditional reasoning features in a wide range of areas spanning nonmonotonic reasoning, causal inference, learning, and more generally reasoning under uncertainty.\nThis paper proposes an algebraic structure for conditional events which serves as a logical basis to analyse the concept of conditional probability -a fundamental tool in Artificial Intelligence.\nAt least since the seminal work of Gaifman [22] , who in turn develops the initial ideas of his supervisor Alfred Tarski [31] , it has been considered natural to investigate the conditions under which Boolean algebras -i.e. classical logic -played the role of the logic of events for probability. The point is clearly made in [23] : Since events are always described in some language they can be identified with the sentences that describe them and the probability function can be regarded as an assignment of values to sentences. The extensive accumulated knowledge concerning formal languages makes such a project feasible.\nWe are interested in pursuing the same idea, but taking conditional probability as a primitive notion and obtain unconditional probability by specialisation. Taking conditional probability as primitive has a long tradition which dates back at least to [12] and includes [32, 44, 45, 51] . The key justification for doing this lies in the methodological view that no assessment of probability takes place in a vacuum. On the contrary, each probabilistic evaluation must be done in the light of all and only the available evidence. In this sense, any probabilistic assessment of uncertainty is always conditional.\nThe first step in achieving our goal is to clarify how conditional knowledge and information should be represented. To do this we put forward a structure for representing conditional events, taken as the primitive objects of uncertainty quantification. In other words we aim to capture the logic/algebra which plays the role of classical logic when the focus of probability theory is shifted on conditional probability. In our preliminary investigations [20, 21] on the subject we suggested taking the methodological approach of asking the following questions:\n(i) which properties of conditional probabilities depend on properties of the measure and do not depend on the logical properties of conditional events?\n(ii) which properties do instead depend on the logic -whatever it is -of conditional events?\nBruno de Finetti was the first not to take the notion of conditional events for granted and argued that they cannot be described by truth-functional classical logic. He expressed this by referring to conditional events as trievents [12, 14] , with the following motivation. Since, intuitively, conditional events of the form \"a given b\" express some form of hypothetical assertion -the assertion of the consequent a based on the supposition that the antecedent b is satisfied -the logical evaluation of a conditional amounts to a two-step procedure. We first check the antecedent. If this is not satisfied, the conditional ceases to mean anything at all. Otherwise we move on to evaluating the consequent and the conditional event takes the same value as the consequent.\nThis interpretation allowed de Finetti to use the classical notion of uncertainty resolution for conditional events implicitly assumed by Hausdorff and Kolmogorov, except for the fact that de Finetti allowed the evaluation of conditional events to be a partial function. This is illustrated clearly by referring to the betting interpretation of subjective probability, which indeed can be extended to a number of coherence-based measures of uncertainty [18, 19] . To illustrate this, fix an uncertainty resolving valuation v, or in other words a two-valued classical logic valuation. Then de Finetti interprets conditional events \"\u03b8 given \u03c6\" as follows: a bet on \"\u03b8 given \u03c6\" is\n\uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 won if v(\u03c6) = v(\u03b8) = 1; lost if v(\u03c6) = 1 and v(\u03b8) = 0; called-off if v(\u03c6) = 0.\nThis idea has been developed in uncertain reasoning, with links with non monotonic reasoning, in [17, 36, 35, 34] .",
        "for so-called Ord-Horn languages [NB95] , and AND/OR precedence constraints in scheduling [MSS04] .\nA natural generalization of the CSP is the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem (QCSP) for a relational structure \u0393, denoted by QCSP(\u0393) that next to existential allows also universal quantifiers in the input sentence. Similarly as the CSP, this problem has been studied widely in the literature, see e.g. [BBJK03, Che12] . In this paper, we study QCSP(\u0393) for temporal languages. Although a number of partial results has been obtained [BC10, ZM21, CM12, CW08b, CW08a, CW12, CBW14, Wro14b], these efforts did not lead to a full complexity classification of all temporal QCSP(\u0393). One of the reasons is that QCSPs are usually harder to classify than CSPs. This also holds in our case. For instance, temporal CSPs are at most NP-complete, whereas temporal QCSPs can be at most PSPACE-complete. In more detail, nine tractable classes of temporal CSPs identified in [BK09] are given by so-called polymorphisms that are in the case of temporal languages \u0393 operations from Q k for some k \u2208 N to Q that preserve \u0393 (homomorphisms from \u0393 k to \u0393). The first of these classes is the class preserved by constant operations, the other polymorphisms (all binary) that come into play are named: min, max, mx, dual-mx, mi, dual-mi, ll, dual-ll. Although constant polymorphisms make CSP trivial, QCSP for a temporal language preserved by a constant polymorphism may be even PSPACE-complete [CW08a] . When it comes to min, max, mx, dual-mx, these operations provide tractability for both temporal CSPs and QCSPs [CBW14] , the complexity of temporal QCSPs preserved by mi and dual-mi is not known. But it is known that ll and dual-ll do not in general provide tractability for temporal QCSPs [BC10, Wro14b] .",
        "Offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) provides a data-driven perspective on learning decisionmaking policies by using previously collected data without any additional online interaction during the training process (Lange et al., 2012; Levine et al., 2020) . Despite its recent development (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Nair et al., 2020; An et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2020) and application progress (Zhan et al., 2022; Apostolopoulos et al., 2021; Soares et al., 2021) , one of the current challenges in ORL remains algorithms extrapolation error, which is an inability to correctly estimate the values of unseen actions (Fujimoto et al., 2019) . Numerous algorithms were designed to address this issue. For example, Kostrikov et al. (2021) (IQL) avoids estimation for out-of-sample actions entirely. Similarly, Kumar et al. (2020) (CQL) penalizes out-of-distribution actions such that their values are lower-bounded. Other methods explicitly make the learned policy closer to the behavioral one (Fujimoto & Gu, 2021; Nair et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) .\nIn contrast to prior studies, recent works (An et al., 2021) demonstrated that simply increasing the number of value estimates in the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018) algorithm is enough to advance state-of-the-art performance consistently across various datasets in the D4RL benchmark (Fu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, An et al. (2021) showed that the double-clip trick actually serves as an uncertainty-quantification mechanism providing the lower bound of the estimate, and simply increasing the number of critics can result in a sufficient penalization for out-of-distribution actions. Despite its state-of-the-art results, the performance gain for some datasets requires significant computation time or optimization of an additional term, leading to extended training duration (Figure 2 ).",
        "In the field of AI-generated content, there has been growing interest in expanding the generative capabilities of pretrained text-to-image (T2I) models to text-to-video (T2V) generation [5, 9-12, 14, 20, 27, 33] . Recent studies have introduced zero-shot T2V [10, 12, 14] , which aims to adapt image diffusion models for video generation without additional training. These methods utilize the ability of image diffusion models, originally trained on static images, to generate frame sequences from video text prompts. However, generating coherent dynamic visual scenes in videos remains challenging due to the succinct and abstract nature of video text prompts.\nMeanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrated their capability to generate layouts to control visual modules, especially image generation models [3, 19, 32] . These capabilities indicate a potential for LLMs to understand complex video prompts and generate fine-grained spatio-temporal layouts to guide video synthesis. However, generating spatio-temporal layouts for videos is more intricate, necessitating the LLMs to comprehend and illustrate how objects move and transform over time.\nFurthermore, recent research [10, 12] in zero-shot T2V proposes utilizing LLMs to break down video text into frame-level descriptions. These descriptions are crafted to represent each moment or event within the video, guiding image diffusion models to generate semantic-coherent videos. However, these frame-level descriptions only capture the basic temporal semantics of video prompts, lacking detailed spatio-temporal information necessary for ensuring smooth object motion and consistent frame-to-frame coherence in videos. Additionally, representing global background movement to depict camera motion is crucial for immersive video generation [8, 30] , which further complicates video generation.\nIn this paper, we introduce FlowZero, a novel framework that integrates LLMs with image diffusion models to generate temporally-coherent videos from text prompts. FlowZero utilizes LLMs for comprehensive analysis and translating the video text prompt into a proposed structured Dynamic Scene Syntax (DSS). Unlike previous methods that only provide basic semantic descriptions, the DSS contains scene descriptions, layouts for foreground objects, and background motion patterns. Foreground layouts contain a series of bounding boxes that define each frame's spatial arrangement and track changes in the positions and sizes of objects. This ensures that the coherent object motion and transformation align with the textual prompt. Additionally, FlowZero incorporates an iterative self-refinement process. This process effectively enhances the alignment between the generated layouts and the textual descriptions, specifically addressing inaccuracies such as spatial and temporal errors. In the self-refinement process, the generated layouts are iteratively compared and adjusted against the text through a feedback loop, ensuring a high fidelity and coherence of the spatio-temporal layouts.\nFlowZero prompts LLMs to predict background motion patterns to enhance temporal coherence and consistency, which can be used to control global scenes and camera motion in video frames. For instance, consider a text that describes a horse running from right to left, as shown in the middle example of Figure 1 . The LLMs predict a corresponding camera motion, making the background move from left to right, enhancing the video's immersiveness [8, 30] . The background motion pattern includes specific directions and speeds.",
        "Non-consensual synthetic intimate imagery (NSII) refers to digitally altered content that is fake but depicts the faces, bodies, and/or voices of real people. NSII can be created through more traditional means using photo-editing software to stitch together segments, add filters, or change the speed of videos -often referred to as \"shallowfakes\" or \"cheapfakes.\" Increasingly, however, NSII is being created through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), involving different methods, such as speech-to-speech voice conversion, lipsyncing, puppet-master, face synthesis, attribute manipulation, and face-swapping [83] . AI-generated NSII is more colloquially known as \"deepfake pornography.\" The consumer creation of deepfakes (a portmanteau of \"deep learning\" and \"fake\" [72, 81] ) started in late 2017 on Reddit, after a user named \"deepfakes\" posted NSII depicting the faces of female celebrities \"stitched\" onto pornographic videos [44, 81] . Continued consumer interest in deepfakes is reflected in the proliferation of dedicated deepfake sites and forums, often depicting celebrity targets. While deepfakes can be used in beneficial ways for accessibility and creativity [19, 26] , abuse potential has increased in recent years as the technology has advanced in sophistication and availability [12, 34, 53, 80] . Deepfakes can be weaponized and used for malicious purposes, including financial fraud, disinformation dissemination, cyberbullying, and sexual extortion (\"sextortion\") [4, 26] .\nNon-consensual deepfake pornography can be considered a form of image-based sexual abuse because intimate images are created and/or shared without the consent of the person or persons depicted in the images. The harms of image-based sexual abuse have been well-documented, including negative impacts on victim-survivors' mental health, career prospects, and willingness to engage with others both online and offline [16, 39] .",
        "Explaining the behaviour of machine learning algorithms or AI remains a key challenge in machine learning. With the guidelines of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1] calling for explainable AI, it has come to the machine learning community's attention that better understanding of black-box models is needed. Despite substantial research in explaining the behaviour of supervised machine-learning, it is unclear what should constitute an explanation for Reinforcement Learning (RL). Current works in explainable reinforcement learning use similar techniques as those used to explain a supervised classifier [22] , as such their explanations highlight what in the current environment drives an agent to take an action, but not what the agent expects the action to achieve. Frequently, the consequences of the agent's actions are not immediate and a chain of many decisions all contribute to a single desired outcome. This paper addresses this problem by asking what chain of events the agent intended to happen as a result of a particular action choice. The importance of such explanations based around intended outcome in day-to-day life is well-known in psychology with Malle [20] estimating that around 70% of these day-to-day explanations are intent-based. While the notion of intent makes little sense in the context of supervised classification, it is directly applicable to agent-based reasoning, and it is perhaps surprising that we are the first work in explainable RL to directly address this. Recent work [18] has called for these introspective abilities which they refer to as \"Explainable Agency\".\nWe present a simple addition to standard value-based RL frameworks which allows us to obtain a projection of predicted future trajectories from a current observation and proposed action.",
        "In addition to cryptography, which is aimed to hide the exchanged information, steganography is created to hide the principle of existence of communication between two persons [1] . In steganography, if the adversary even doubts the existence of a communications (while he has not even been able to prove it), the steganographer has failed. In some steganography schemes, for improve the security, the message is first encrypted and then embedded, which is contrary to the nature of steganography. At the other side, steganalysis is used to discover the existence of a communication. Any media can be used for steganography, but media with a high degree of redundancy are more suitable [1] . For this reason, photo, audio and video are often used for steganography [2] [3] [4] .\nBlockchain is a p2p network firstly used for digital currency [5] . Due to its unique features, researchers in various fields have taken advantage of the Blockchain [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Bitcoin is the first and most widely used digital currency. In bitcoin, the distributed consensus achive between miners ensures that the information sent to the blockchain remains unchanged and permanent in the blockchain. In bitcoin, the sender signs the transaction and sends it to the blockchain. There are also different payment models in bitcoin, the three most popular of which are pay to public key(p2pk), pay to public key hash(p2pkh) and pay to script hash(p2sh). In p2pk, the sender deposits the money into the receiver's public key, and the receiver can receive it by signing his public key and sending it to the blockchain. In p2pkh, the sender deposits the money into the receiver's public key hash, and the receiver can receive the money by sending the public key and signing it to the blockchain.",
        "With deep learning models/algorithms becoming the norm of the modern AI systems, it has become essential to evaluate these algorithms (and systems) thoroughly to minimize any adverse impact on the society. The incorporation of bias in the algorithms is one primary issue that has been highlighted in the literature [8] , [22] . Research has shown that the performance of deep learning algorithms vary for people with different attributes such as gender and skin-tone subgroups under a variety of settings [2] , [17] . For instance, it has recently been observed that the automatic face-cropping algorithm of Twitter favors young and lighter-skinned people over others [23] . With increasing instances of these issues, it is of paramount importance to include fairness as one of the metrics for evaluation of these algorithms.\nFairness of facial analysis algorithms is being studied in the literature for the last few years [15] , [20] , [21] , [22] . Most of the research efforts have been concentrated towards establishing awareness towards bias in face recognition systems and a number of datasets have been proposed for the same [10] , [24] . However, limited research work has studied the impact of face detection which forms an important part of the recognition pipeline and failure in which can lead to incorrect decisions (Fig. 1 ). To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies on bias in face detection focus on bounding box localization. As the first contribution of this work, we analyze different facial detectors to understand if they exhibit any biased behavior. The presence of bias in deep models has been attributed to non-demographic factors (such as variation in pose, illumination, and image quality), as well as more complex, demographic factors such as race, gender, and skin tone [11] .\nTo study biased behavior, datasets with extensive annotations corresponding to different attributes are required which are lacking in existing databases.",
        "Many state-of-the-art deep neural network models are pre-trained on large datasets before being finetuned for downstream tasks [13, 17, 23, 1] . While the composition of their pre-training dataset has been shown to be a key factor in the performance of these models [7, 9, 14, 8, 12, 26] , how best to design these pre-training datasets still remains underexplored. In this work, we focus on supervised pre-training, one of the most popular pre-training paradigms, and study two key quantities of a supervised pre-training dataset: intra-class diversity (the number of different samples within each pre-training class) and inter-class diversity (the number of different pre-training classes). Intuitively, both diversities are beneficial for supervised pre-training [13] . Yet when the size of the pre-training dataset is fixed, these diversities trade off, since increasing one will decrease the other. Our work studies the impact of this dataset diversity trade-off on downstream performance, as well as how to balance them to design a supervised pre-training dataset with the best downstream performance.\nEmpirically, with ImageNet [24] as the pre-training dataset and the pre-training dataset size fixed, we show that the optimal performance on the downstream tasks occurs when a balance on the intra-/interclass diversity is achieved. We then offer a theoretical explanation for this effect by first modeling the dataset generation process through a two-step sampling framework, and then demonstrating that the test error of the downstream task displays a rational relationship with respect to the class-to-sample ratio, i.e., the ratio of the number of pre-training classes to the number of samples per class, or, in other words, the ratio between inter-/intra-class diversity. The established analytical relationship between downstream performance and the class-to-sample ratio can serve as a guiding principle in designing a supervised pre-training dataset by estimating the optimal class-to-sample ratio rather than the grid search.\nNotably, our theory shows that given a source of a pre-training dataset and a downstream task, the optimal class-to-sample ratio is invariant to the size of the pre-training dataset. Based on such an invariance, one could estimate the optimal class-to-sample ratio with small pre-training datasets and then leverage it to build a large-scale pre-training dataset. In particular, the optimal number of pretraining classes K and the number of examples per class n are proportional to the square root of the size of the pre-training dataset N , i.e., K \u221d \u221a N , which leads to an invariant optimal class-to-sample ratio. We empirically verify our theoretical findings on ImageNet [24] and present the effectiveness of its application in predicting the optimal number of classes for pre-training datasets with different sizes. In addition, we conducted experiments with different pre-trained datasets, different model backbones, and downstream tasks of different domains to demonstrate that our findings are consistent across many scenarios.\nOur major findings and contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 In supervised pre-training, we observe that with a fixed pre-training dataset size, there exists a trade-off between intra-class and inter-class diversities. This balance between diversities plays a crucial role in shaping the downstream performance, underscoring the significance of considering both aspects when designing the pre-training dataset;",
        "Planning is an important facet of AI that gives efficient algorithms for solving current real-world problems. Stochastic Shortest Path problems (SSPs) (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis 1991) generalise classical (deterministic) planning by introducing actions with probabilistic effects, which lets us model problems where the actions are intrinsically probabilistic. Value Iteration (VI) (Bellman 1957 ) is a dynamic programming algorithm that forms the basis of optimal algorithms for solving SSPs. VI finds the cost-to-go for each state, which describes the solution of an SSP. A state s's cost-to-go is the minimum expected cost of reaching a goal from s, and similarly a action a's cost-to-go is the minimum after applying a. VI finds the optimal cost-to-go by iteratively applying Bellman backups, which update each state's cost-to-go with the minimal outgoing action's cost-to-go.\nLRTDP (Bonet and Geffner 2003) and iLAO * (Hansen and Zilberstein 2001) , the state-of-the-art algorithms for optimally solving SSPs, build on VI and offer significant speedup by using heuristics to apply Bellman backups only to promising states and pruning states that are deemed too expensive. A shortcoming of such algorithms is that each Bellman backup must consider all applicable actions. For instance, let s and a be a state and an applicable action, even if all successors of a will be pruned because they are too expensive, a Bellman backup on s still computes the Q-value of a, so these algorithms can prune unpromising states but not actions. This issue is compounded because algorithms for SSPs require arbitrarily many Bellman backups on each state s to find the optimal solution, thus wasting time on computing Q-values for such actions many times.\nThis issue of computing unnecessary Q-values for a state s is addressed by action elimination (Bertsekas 1995) , which can be implemented in search algorithms to prune useless actions. Action elimination looks for pairs (a, a) of applicable actions in a state, such that a lower bound on a's cost-togo exceeds an upper bound on a's cost-to-go, in which case a is proved to be a useless action and can be pruned. Although domain-independent lower bounds (heuristics) can be computed efficiently, finding an efficient, domain-independent upper bound remains an open question to the best of our knowledge. This gap has limited the use of action elimination in domain-independent planning. In the context of optimal heuristic planning for SSPs, the only algorithm we are aware of that utilises action elimination to prune actions is FTVI (Dai, Weld et al. 2009) . Other algorithms, such as BRTDP (McMahan, Likhachev, and Gordon 2005) , FRTDP (Smith and Simmons 2006) and VPI-RTDP (Sanner et al.",
        "Modern vehicular networks have emerged to facilitate intelligent ground transportation systems. Communication technologies in automobiles connect the various elements such as vehicles, pedestrians, infrastructures, roads, cloud computing service platforms, etc. to each other. This has given raise to the concept of V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communications. V2X communications uses recent generation of networking technology to facilitate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-toinfrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) and vehicleto-cloud (V2C) connections (see Fig. 1 for a high-level illustration). V2X communication technology is expected to improve traffic efficiency, reducing traffic incidents and road pollution, saving resources, etc. [1] , [2] . Common use-cases for V2X applications include (but not limited to) [1] - [4] : road safety (e.g., traffic jam/incident reporting, collision warning and collision avoidance), cooperative automated driving, infotainment services (e.g., traffic information services), etc.\nAs with all complex connected computing platforms, extra computing capabilities in vehicles increase the exposure to potential vulnerabilities and also the likelihood of future attacks. Despite the fact that V2X communication aims to provide a robust and resilient transportation infrastructure, V2X technologies (both existing as well as expected future developments) also pose new security challenges. For example, a malicious vehicle can send false observation about the road (say traffic jam or an accident) and bias other vehicles to believe its incorrect observation -as a result other vehicles are forced to change their behavior (say slow-down or reroute). Attack detection (and mitigation) is essential for widely deployed V2X systems, considering the fact that attackers may have physical access to a subset of the system. Attacks to ). An in-vehicle communication unit, known as on-board unit (OBU) is attached with the vehicular control system and act as an external communication interface with other entities (e.g., vehicles/RSUs, etc.).",
        "While several definitions of what a software architecture is exist [11] , e.g., the set of design decisions about a software system [13] , they all refer to the structure of a software system and the reasoning process that led to that structure. A software architecture can be represented through many views that follow different paradigms, such as program comprehension and subsystem patterns [14] , optimized clustering [9] , dependencies, or concerns [4, 6] . (Note that the term concern is used with the meaning something the system needs to have and not something to worry about.)\nHaving an actionable view of a software system is useful for its stakeholders for a variety of reasons, such as usability [1] , security [2] , and maintenance, as we are about to show. However, many reasons exist why an architectural view of a system that reflects its current state may not be available. These include that such a view may never have existed or that the system may have evolved away from it over time [13] . Therefore, an interest exists to produce such a view in an efficient and expedient manner. This is where software architecture recovery comes in. It produces an architectural view of a system from its implementation artifacts, such as its source code. RELAX [6] is a software architecture recovery method that follows a concern-oriented paradigm. It produces a software architecture by running text classification on the code entities of a system and building a view of the architecture from the results. The results are represented textually by a list of concern clusters (source code entities grouped by concerns) as shown in Figure 1 as well as graphically via a directory graph [6] . Additional information for each source entity includes SLOC and dependencies.",
        "As our society depends on a multitude of terrestrial ecosystem services (Manning et al., 2018) , the conservation of the Earth's forests has become a priority on the global political agenda (United Nations). To ensure sustainable development through biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, the United Nations have formulated global forest goals that include maintaining and enhancing global carbon stocks and increasing forest cover by 3% between 2017 and 2030 (United Nations). Yet global demand for commodities is driving deforestation, impeding progress towards these ambitious goals (Hoang and Kanemoto, 2021) . Earth observation and satellite remote sensing play a key role in this context, as they provide the data to monitor the quality of forested area at global scale (Hansen et al., 2013) . However, to measure progress in terms of carbon and biodiversity conservation, novel approaches are needed that go beyond detecting forest cover and can provide consistent information about morphological traits predictive of carbon stock and biodiversity (Skidmore et al., 2021) , at global scale. One key vegetation characteristic is canopy height (Skidmore et al., 2021; Jucker et al., 2017) .\nIn this work, we describe a deep learning framework to map canopy top height globally with high resolution, using publicly available optical satellite images as input. We deploy that model to compute the first global canopy top height product with 10 m ground sampling distance, based on Sentinel-2 optical images for the year 2020. That global map and underlying source code and models, are made publicly available to support conservation efforts as well as science in disciplines such as climate, carbon, and biodiversity modelling. 1Mapping canopy height in a consistent fashion at global scale is key to understand terrestrial ecosystem functions, which are dominated by vegetation height and vegetation structure (Migliavacca et al., 2021) . Canopy top height is an important indicator of biomass and the associated, global aboveground carbon stock (Duncanson et al., 2022) . At high spatial resolution, canopy height models (CHM) directly characterize habitat heterogeneity (Tuanmu and Jetz, 2015) , which is why canopy height has been ranked as a high-priority biodiversity variable to be observed from space (Skidmore et al., 2021) . Furthermore, forests buffer microclimate temperatures under the canopy (De Frenne et al., 2019) . While it has been shown that in the tropics higher canopies provide a stronger dampening effect on microclimate extremes (Jucker et al., 2018) , targeted studies are needed to see if such relationships also hold true at global scale (De Frenne et al., 2019) .",

        "Diffusion models [13, 36, 38] have experienced a remarkable surge in their capabilities and applications [22, 25, 29] . Among them, Stable Diffusion (SD) [30] and SDXL [27] are pre-trained models on the large-scale dataset LAION-5B [33] , having emerged as powerful generative models.\nAdditionally, the open-source community has been enriched by numerous personalized diffusion models from CivitAI [4] , trained with DreamBooth [32] or Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) [15] . They are capable of generating imaginative high-quality images at the training resolution (e.g., 512\u00d7512 for SD-based models and 1024 \u00d7 1024 for SDXL-based models) using the given prompts. However, they often suffer from limitations when generating images with resolutions outside of their trained domain. As shown in Fig. 2 , the SDbased model and the personalized diffusion model generate lower-resolution images (e.g., 256 \u00d7 256) with the poor fidelity and higher-resolution images (e.g., 1024 \u00d7 1024) with the poor framing and composition. As a result, we can name this phenomena as the resolution domain inconsistent.\nExisting work is categorized into two main research directions to address this limitation. The first research line is postprocessing [1, 9, 16] , represented by MultiDiffusion [1] and ElasticDiffusion [9] , where images with resolutions in their trained domain are repeatedly processed and then stitched together to generate images with flexible resolutions through overlap. However, this approach often takes longer inference time with complex post-process operations. The second research line is straightforward. Fine-tuning on a broader range of resolutions to empower diffusion models to generate resolution-free images with LoRA [15] . However, most personalized models in CivitAI [4] do not provide details about their training datasets. Fine-tuning on the general dataset like LAION-5B [33] inevitably influences their original style domain, which is shown in Fig. 2 .

To answer this question, we decompose it into three dimensions: (1) resolution interpolation: generate images with resolutions below the trained resolution of diffusion models. (2) resolution extrapolation: process images with resolutions above the trained resolution of diffusion models. (3) style domain consistency: generate images without transforming the original style domain of the diffusion model.",
        "Pioneer power theories for analysing electrical systems were developed by Steinmetz, Kennelly and Heaviside, among others, by the end of the XIX century [1] , [2] , [3] . Nowadays, these theories are still a source of discussion and debate concerning their correctness and physical interpretation [4] . Some of them were formulated in the frequency domain, such as those proposed by Budeanu [5] and Czarnecki [6] , while other ones where formulated in the time domain, like those presented by Fryze [7] , Akagi [8] and Depenbrock [9] . More recently, Lev-Ari [10] and Salmer\u00f3n [11] have made relevant contributions to the field by using the Hilbert Transform (HT) and tensor algebra, respectively. All these theories are devoted to explain the power-transfer process between complex electrical systems and they establish mathematical concepts associated to fictitious powers (e.g. reactive power), which are of a great value from the engineering point of view. Unfortunately, none of the existing proposals can be used to separate current components in the time domain under any type of voltage distortion, asymmetry, non-linearity of the load or combinations thereof. Some of these limitations have been reported in the literature [4] , [12] .\nIn this paper, a new proposal is presented to overcome these limitations by applying two mathematical tools: geometric algebra (GA) and the HT. GA is a versatile tool that can be used to model different physical and mathematical problems [13] . The application of GA makes it possible to separate current components that have engineering relevance for systems with any number of phases (including single-phase systems) [14] , [15] . The term \"engineering relevance\" was explicitly used while the term \"physical relevance\" was avoided, mainly because one of the main applications of power theories is current decomposition for load compensation purposes.",
        "Developer discussions play a vital role in software development. The discussions solicit the opinions of other developers and document important decisions in today's pull-based software development process [1] . Discussions about software design, in particular, are a highly interactive process and many decisions involve considerable back and forth. These decisions greatly impact software architecture [2, 3] . Discussions are also a rich software artifact for learning about the software itself [4] . Recent progress in research [5, 6] suggests that developer discussions often contain rich information on the background of the design of the software as well as rationale and reflections on the design changes and choices over time.\nSuch discussions are also one of the potential artifacts for newcomers to understand the architecture and design of the system [7] . However, these discussions about design are often scattered across different places such as commit mes-sages, pull requests, and issue tracker comments. It is impractical for anyone to go through all the thousands of threads of discussions and find out the discussion about a particular design topic. Solving this problem is the challenge of what we call design mining, which is a branch of research based on mining software repositories. Being able to mine design discussions would lead to a novel approach of improved documentation, enabling improved traceability of requirements, refactoring and bug fixing support, and maintainability.\nThe simplest formulation of the design mining problem is defined as classifying developer discussion as either design or not-design 1 . Discussions are extracted from software artifacts, including but not limited to pull requests, issues, code comments, and Q&A interactions 2 . This classification process is usually supervised: manual labelling of the data with human effort by following a coding guide, then leveraging automatic classification using machine learning models and advances in natural language processing to classify the discussions according to some specific features.\nVerification of the correctness of manual classification is achieved by meeting and agreement among the participants. Validation of automatic classification is measured by evaluating the classifiers with a manually labelled small set of data, which is referred to as the gold set. Almost all the studies in this field have attempted to produce a best-performing and validated automated classifier [8, 9, 5] . For example, a state of the art (SOTA) result from Viviani et al. [10] talks about a well validated model with Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.87. However, achieving conclusion stability [11] remains a challenge. Most studies focus on evaluating a classifier on data from a single dataset and discussion artifact. In this paper we focus on conclusion stability by developing a model with wide applicability to different design discussions which could be used with high accuracy across different projects, and artifact types.\nAutomatic detection of design points can significantly reduce development time for both contributing developers as well as reviewers. It can also help to use rich design information with ease which is a struggle for newcomers to an open source project [12] .",
        "The goal of 3D human performance capture is the space-time coherent tracking of the entire human surface from different sensor types; this is a long-standing and challenging computer vision problem. Such densely tracked characters can be used in film, game, and mixed reality applications to create immersive and photo-real virtual doubles of real humans.\nPrevious multi-view-based approaches [11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 22, 49, 55, 59, 60, 80, 85] can capture high-quality surface details. However, they rely on impractical and expensive multicamera capture setups. To commoditize performance capture, ideally, just a single RGB camera should be necessary while still allowing users to track both the body pose and non-rigid deformations of skin and clothing. Prior monocular approaches were able to recover the pose and shape of a naked human body model [38, 39, 57] , hands [10, 17, 23, 53, 82, 93, 94, 97] , facial expression [41, 72, 73, 74, 77] , or all of them [36, 58, 87, 98] ; recovering cloth deformations remains out of their reach. Some previous work on monocular 3D human and clothes reconstruction uses volumetric [21, 95] or continuous implicit representations [65] . However, these approaches do not track space-time coherent surfaces and lack surface correspondences over time. On the other hand, template-based monocular methods [24, 25, 47, 90] can track low-frequency surface details coherently over time, but cannot capture facial expressions and hand gestures. Joint capture of all aspects remains poorly studied.\nTo address these limitations, we present HiFECap, a novel monocular learning-based 3D human performance capture approach that jointly captures the skeletal pose, dense surface deformations, hand gestures, and facial identity and expressions; see Fig. 1 for an overview. First, convolutional neural networks predict the skeletal pose and the coarse surface deformations from the segmented monocular image of the actor. High-frequency surface details are recovered by a deformation network as dense vertex displacements. These intermediate outputs are then combined in a differentiable character representation, which can be supervised with multi-view images and 3D point clouds during training. We further replace the hand and face regions of the original template with parametric hand and face models using our proposed registration strategy, and drive them by predicting the parameters from images.",
        "3D city data has been increasingly used to perform analysis in various applications, e.g., security management and emergency response, energy consumption and estimation, and occupancy measurement. A widely adopted standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for representing and exchanging 3D city models is CityGML [5, 22] . It defines the three-dimensional geometry, topology, semantics, and appearance of the most relevant topographic objects in urban or regional contexts. The representation of semantic and topological properties in CityGML makes it possible to query such 3D city data to perform analysis.\nAt the implementation level, CityGML is defined as a GML application schema for the Geography Markup Language (GML) [5] . In its most common implementation, CityGML datasets consist of a set of XML files and possibly some accompanying image files that are used as textures. Each text file can represent a part of the dataset, such as a specific region, a specific type of object (such as a set of roads), or a predefined Level of Detail (LoD). The structure of a CityGML file is a hierarchy that ultimately reaches down to individual objects and their attributes. These objects have a geometry that is described using GML. Another important implementation of CityGML is 3DCi-tyDB [11] , which is a free 3D geo-database solution for CityGML-based 3D city models. 3DCityDB has been developed as an open source and platform-independent software suite to facilitate the development and deployment of 3D city model applications.",

        "The intuition that the concept of a constructively defined function and a computable function can be identified is prevalent in intuitionistic logic since the advent of recursion theory and is maybe most natural in constructive type theory, where computation is primitive.\nA formalisation of the intuition is the axiom CT (\"Church's thesis\"), stating that every function is computable, i.e. definable in a model of computation. CT is well-studied as part of Russian constructivism [34] and in the field of constructive reverse mathematics [11, 25] .\nCT allows proving results of recursion theory without extensive references to a model of computation, since one can reason with functions instead. While such synthethic developments of computability theory [1, 7, 37] can be carried out in principle without assuming any axioms [14] , assuming CT allows stronger results: CT essentially provides a universal machine w.r.t. all functions in the logic, allowing to show the non-existence of certain deciding functions -whose existence is logically independent with no axioms present.\nIt is easy to see that CT is in conflict with traditional classical mathematics, since the law of excluded middle LEM together with a form of the axiom of countable choice AC N,N allows the definition of non-computable functions [46] . This observation can be sharpened in various ways: To define a non-computable function directly, the weak limited principle of omniscience WLPO and the countable unique choice axiom AUC N,B suffice. Alternatively, Kleene noticed that there is a decidable tree predicate with infinitely many nodes but no computable infinite path [28] . If functions and computable functions are identified via CT, a Kleene tree is in conflict with weak K\u0151nig's lemma WKL and with Brouwer's fan theorem.",
        "3D object detection, as a fundamental task in computer vision and robotics, has been extensively studied with the development of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. Currently, LiDAR sensor is widely used for perception tasks because it can provide accurate range measurements of the surrounding environment, especially for the obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists, etc. With the development of the deep learning techniques on point-cloud based representation, many LiDAR-based 3D object detection approaches have been developed. Generally, these approaches can be categorized into point-based [1] and voxelbased [2] , [3] methods. LiDAR sensors have the superiority of providing distance information of the obstacles, even though the detailed geometry is often lost due to its sparse scanning and furthermore texture and color information can be not captured. Therefore, False Positive (FP) detection and wrong categories classification often happen for LiDARbased object detection solutions.\n{xushaoqing, zhoudingfu, fangjin, liangjun zhang}@baidu.com {xsq0226,binzhou}@buaa.edu.cn *Corresponding author. On the contrary, the camera sensors can provide detailed texture and color information with high resolution, though the depth has been lost during the perspective projection based imaging procedure. The combination of the two different types of sensors of LiDAR and camera is a promising way for boosting the performance of autonomous driving perception. In literature, multi-modal based object detection approaches can be divided into as early fusion [4] , [5] , deep fusion [6] - [8] and late fusion approaches [9] . Early fusion approaches aim at creating a new type of data by combining the raw data directly before sending them into the detection framework. Usually, these kinds of methods require pixellevel correspondence between each type sensor data. Different from the early fusion methods, late fusion approaches execute the detection for each type of data separately first and then fuse the detection results in the bounding box level. Different from the above two methods, deep fusionbased methods usually extract the features with different types of deep neural networks first and then fuse them at the features level. As a simple yet effective sequential fusion method, PointPainting [5] has achieved superior detection results on different benchmarks. This approach employees the 2D image semantic segmentation results from an offthe-shelf neural network first and then adds them into a point-cloud-based 3D object detection based on the 2D-3D projection. The superiority of PointPainting suggests that 2D image segmentation approach can be used for providing the semantic results and it can be incorporated into any 3D object detectors even point-based or voxel-based approaches.\nHowever, the boundary-blurring effect often happens in image-based semantic segmentation methods due to the relatively low resolution of the deep feature map. This effect becomes much more severe after re-projecting them into the 3D point cloud. An example of the reprojected 2D result into 3D is shown in sub-fig. 1-(a) . Taking the big truck at the bottom of the image as an example, we can find that there is a large frustum area of the background (e.g, points in orange color) that has been miss-classified as foreground due to the inaccurate segmentation results in the 2D image. In addition, the correspondence of 3D points to 2D image pixels is not exactly a one-to-one projection due to the digital quantization problem, and many-to-one projection issues. An interesting phenomenon is that the segmentation from the 3D point cloud (e.g., sub-fig. 1-(b )) performs much better on the boundary of obstacles. However, compared to the 2D image, the category classification from the 3D point cloud often gives worse results(e.g.,point in blue color) due to the detailed texture information from the RGB images.\nThe painted points [5] , with semantic information has been proved to be very effective for the object detection task even with some semantic errors. An intuition idea is that the detection performance can be further improved if 2D and 3D segmentation results can be fused together.",
        "One of the main difficulties of the boundary element method (BEM) is the efficient approximation of singular integrals that appear in the boundary integral equation (BIE) . One approach to overcome this challenge is to superimpose known solutions to the unknown fields such that singularities are removed (Cruse, 1974; Liu and Rudolphi, 1999; Liu, 2000; Klaseboer et al., 2009) . This approach is referred to as nonsingular, regularized or desingularized BEM. It is applied to linear elasticity (Scott et al., 2013; Taus et al., 2019) , to Stokes flow (Taus et al., 2016; Harmel et al., 2018) and to the Helmholtz equation (Simpson et al., 2014; Peake et al., 2015) , among others. Klaseboer et al. (2012) further apply nonsingular BEM to fluid mechanics by considering Stokes equations for viscous flow, Laplace equation for potential flow and Helmholtz equation for free-streamline flow.\nThe nonsingular BEM avoids singular integrals and is thus commonly used in recent papers, but it requires additional integrals and knowledge about analytical solutions and is further disadvantageous in efficiency and implementation (Khayat and Wilton, 2005 ).",
        "Whole slide scanning is increasingly used in disease diagnosis and pathological research to visualize tissue samples. Compared to traditional microscope-based observation, whole slide scanning converts glass slides into gigapixel digital images that can be conveniently stored and analyzed. However, the high resolution of WSIs also makes their automated classification challenging [15] . Patch-based classification is a common solution to this problem [8, 24, 3] . It predicts the slidelevel label by first predicting the labels of small, tiled patches in a WSI. This approach allows for the direct application of existing image classification models, but requires additional patch-level labeling. Unfortunately, patch-level labeling by histopathology experts is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, many weakly-supervised [8, 24] and semi-supervised [5, 3] methods have been proposed to generate patch-level pseudo labels at a lower cost. However, the lack of reliable supervision directly hinders the performance of these methods, and serious class-imbalance problems could arise, as tumor patches may only account for a small portion of the entire WSI [12] .\nIn contrast, MIL-based methods have become increasingly preferred due to their only demand for slide-level labels [18] . The typical pipeline of MIL methods is shown in Fig. 1 , where WSIs are treated as bags, and tiled patches are considered as instances. The aim is to predict whether there are positive instances, such as tumor patches, in a bag, and if so, the bag is considered positive as well. In practice, a fixed ImageNet pre-trained feature extractor g(\u2022) is usually used to convert the tiled patches in a WSI into feature maps due to limited GPU memory. These instance features are then aggregated by a(\u2022) into a slide-level feature vector to be sent to the bag-level classifier f (\u2022) for MIL training. Due to the high computational cost, end-to-end training of the feature extractor and bag classifier is prohibitive, especially for high-resolution WSIs. As a result, many methods focus solely on improving a(\u2022) or f (\u2022), leaving g(\u2022) untrained on the WSI dataset (as shown in Fig. 2(b) ).",
        "Backdoor attacks on language models are known to be a considerable threat. Among these are data poisoning attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities in models by inserting specific triggers into the training data (Chen et al., 2021; Qi et al., 2021b,c,d) . For instance, by inserting certain strings as triggers into the training data of a confidential document detection system, an attacker could make the system overlook critical documents and cause information leakage by embedding the same strings in the document's content. Recent studies (Kasneci et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Bommasani et al., 2021; Carlini et al., 2021) further demonstrate that training examples of language models, including sensitive personal information, could be extracted by backdoor attackers with malicious inquires. Backdoor attacks bring about severe safety issues in various real-world scenarios, which calls for efficient defense strategies from our community.\nAmong attempts to counter backdoor attacks, one popular method is to remove backdoor triggers either during the training or test phase. Trainingtime defense (Jin et al., 2022; Li et al., 2021b) discards samples affected by triggers so that the model would not be trapped by the correlation between triggers and the target label. Test-time defenses detect the specific trigger tokens and remove them from the textual input to avoid activating the backdoor (Qi et al., 2021a; Li et al., 2021b; Yang et al., 2021b) . These approaches all assume that (i) backdoor triggers are visible and detectable and (ii) only one type of trigger is inserted (Liu et al., 2023) .",
        "M Ore companies are embracing Information Technol- ogy (IT) in their operations [1] . To standardize ITrelated activities, the British government developed the IT Infrastructural Library (ITIL), which defines the standards and best practice across the entire IT service life-cycle (e.g., strategy, design, transition, operation, and continuous service improvement). According to the ITIL, \u00e2 \u0202IJoperation\u00e2 \u0202\u02d9I refers to processes which are crucial to the day-to-day running of companies, encompasses the direct delivery of goods and services from service providers to end users. Our study investigates the ticket routing problem in incident management and service operation.\nAn incident is an event that prevents a user from performing their task. It could be due to a system fault, an access request, or a lack of user knowledge. An incident ticket is a document containing user-generated text and system information. Figure 1 depicts a standard workflow for processing a ticket, recommended by ITIL. First, the user creates an incident ticket, either directly or by contacting the helpdesk. Each newly created ticket needs to be matched with an expert group in charge of processing it. An expert group is a unit of supporting staff who are experts in certain areas. If the first assigned group solves the problem, the ticket is resolved (or closed). Otherwise, the routing system needs to transfer the ticket to another group for processing until the ticket is resolved. Initial group assignment and inter-group transfer are individually studied as problems of routing recommendation [2] , [3] , [4] , and expert recommen-Fig. 1 : Incident management workflow as recommended by ITIL. The Ticket Routing problem pertains to the middle of the workflow (enclosed by dotted lines), including assigning the ticket to an initial expert group for processing, and transferring it to another group as if it cannot be resolved. dation [5] , [6] . In this work, we consider both collectively as parts of the larger ticket routing problem.\nManual ticket routing relies heavily on the human experience and predefined rules. Incorrect routing results in delay of incident resolution and the waste of processing resources. Previous works [7] , [8] , [9] approach the problem using classification models trained only on textual content of the tickets.",
        "Recent research seems to indicate that solutions to many fundamental and long-standing problems such as general artificial intelligence are likely to be reached through open-ended exploration of problems and solutions rather than manual engineering of different algorithmic components [8, 28, 30] . Such open-ended processes will require the divergent exploration of parameters in order to avoid deceptive minima in highly non-convex loss or fitness landscapes and encourage diversity in the set of possible solutions. Parameter spaces that need to be explored are more often than not high-dimensional, and many of their dimensions or subspaces can have little to no correlation with the tasks at hand. Therefore, it is desirable to limit the search to useful areas. Novelty Search (NS) [22] , Surprise Search [20] and Curiosity Search [12] are among divergent methods that define a behavior space as a proxy for conducting the search. Such a space can be either hand-engineered or learned [11, 13, 24, 26] . In this paper, we focus on NS, but the proposed method can also be applied to other search approaches.\nWhile most behavior spaces that are used for NS in the literature are very low-dimensional (usually < 8), it is reasonable to expect that as NS is applied to increasingly complex domains, the need for higher dimensional behavior descriptors will arise. This is problematic since NS traditionally makes use of k-nearest neighbours search relative to an archive of previously visited individuals which are usually considered to lie in Euclidean space. First, it is wellknown that nearest neighbour search in high-dimensional spaces is ill-defined as the ratio of the distances between the nearest and furthest neighbours to a query point approaches 1 for a large number of point distributions [1, 5] . Second, the time complexity of nearest neighbours lookup in the archive is linearithmic in the archive's size (memory requirements also grow, but this is rarely an issue on modern hardware).",
        "I N order to place a vehicle on the market, car manufacturers need prior authorization, granted by the competent authority, after proving that the vehicle complies with all applicable regulatory standards and safety certification requirements. Whether through vehicle type approval or self-certification approaches, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) must pass stringent certification processes to validate a component, a system, or the entire vehicle [1] .\nConventional vehicles are certified through classical approaches, where different physical certification tests are set up on test tracks or test benches to assess the required safety level using various performance criteria. These approaches are well suited for components, systems, and vehicles with limited complexity and limited interactions with other entities (e.g, braking tests). However, as the complexity of systems increases (e.g., Electronic Stability Control), classical approaches cannot address all relevant safety areas due to R. Izquierdo, C. Salinas, J. Alonso, I.

First, the large number of safety-related systems (including multiple electrical and electronic systems) which increases risks from systematic failures and random hardware failures. This is reasonably well addressed by the existing functional safety and Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASIL) requirements in the automotive industry (e.g., ISO 26262). Second, the enormous variability of possible multi-agent scenarios, which, on the one hand, implies the need for a formal safety model [2] , and on other hand, has led to the introduction of simulation-based safety-oriented audits, as a way to complement physical vehicle testing [3] .\nWith the introduction of assisted (SAE Levels 1 and 2), automated (SAE Level 3), and autonomous (SAE Levels 4 and 5) driving systems [4] , [5] , the overall complexity increases in terms of the number of software functions, variants of multiagent scenarios and interactions, and potentially affected safety areas [6] . The complexity of these systems, and therefore the difficulty to test them, increases with the level of automation, being particularly important the step from SAE Level 3 to 4 since the automated driving system must be able to reach a minimal risk condition within its Operational Design Domain (ODD) without user/passenger intervention [7] .\nNew innovative testing approaches, including procedures of different nature, are needed for future vehicle safety regulatory frameworks and for assessments under current exemption procedures [8] . New online/in-service safety monitoring and verification mechanisms [9] that act after the market deployment of automated driving systems [6] are also needed as a way of reducing the need to test all possible combinations at the time of type-approval. Several national and international regulatory and standardization initiatives and projects are already underway to tackle all these problems [10] .\nOne of the most solid regulatory proposals is being developed by the Working Party on Automated/Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (GRVA) of the UNECE World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29). It is based on three pillars that must be assessed together [11] . First, audit and assessment which includes the use of simulation to cover all types of scenarios, but especially edge case scenarios difficult to occur in real-world traffic. Second, physical certification tests to assess critical scenarios, performed in controlled environments on test tracks (closed-roads), and involving sophisticated equipment such as lightweight global vehicle [12] , articulated pedestrian [13] and bicyclist [14] targets. And finally, real-world test drive, which is devised as a \"driving license test\" for automated driving systems to assess the overall capabilities and behavior of the vehicle in non-simulated traffic on public or open roads. This approach has been the one adopted by UN to regulate the approval of Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) [15] and, more recently, Automated Lane Keeping Systems (ALKS) [16] .",
        "Several studies about Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicles (HUAUVs) have been conducted recently [1] - [8] . These vehicles provide an interesting range of possible applications due to the capability to act in two different environments, including inspection and mapping of partly submerged areas in industrial facilities, search and rescue and other military-related applications. However, the state-of-the-art is yet focused on the vehicle design and structure, where even fewer studies around autonomous navigation have been conducted [9] . The ability to perform tasks in both environments and successfully transit between them imposes additional challenges that must be addressed to make this mobile vehicle autonomously feasible.\nApproaches based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL) techniques have been enhanced to address navigationrelated tasks for a range of mobile vehicles, including ground mobile robots [10] , aerial robots [11] , [12] and underwater robots [13] . These approaches based on single critic actorcritic techniques with multi-layer network structures have achieved interesting results in performing mapless navigation, obstacle avoidance and media transitioning even for HUAUVs [9] . However, the challenges faced by this kind of vehicle make these approaches limited, not being capable of escalating to more complex scenarios for a rescue navigation task, for example.\nIn this work, we explore the use of Deep-RL in the context of HUAUVs to perform navigation-related tasks that can simulate through environmental rescue tasks in robotics. We present two enhanced approaches based on state-of-the-art Deep-RL for the continuous state: (1) a deterministic based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) [14] ; and (2) a stochastic based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [15] . We show that we are capable of training agents with a consistently better capability than state-of-the-art, performing with more stability the mapless navigation, obstacle avoidance and medium transition. We perform a two-fold way evaluation with air-to-water and water-to-air navigation. We compare our DoCRL approaches with single critic-based approaches used to perform mapless navigation and with an adapted version of a traditional Behavior-Based Algorithm (BBA) [16] used in aerial vehicles. Our proposed double critic formulation can be seen in Fig. 1 .\nThis work contains the following main contributions:\n\u2022 We propose two approaches based on state-of-the-art actor-critic double critic Deep-RL algorithms that can successfully perform goal-oriented mapless navigation for HUAUVs, using only range data readings and the vehicles' relative localization data.",
        "The recent surge of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked a transformative phase in programming and software engineering. Pretrained on vast repositories of code-related datasets, these LLMs have acquired a comprehensive understanding of code, enabling them to excel in diverse coderelated tasks. With tools like ChatGPT [26] or LLaMA [37] , researchers have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in generating commit messages [49] , resolving merge conflicts [33] , generating tests [41, 48, 31] , method renaming [1] , and even facilitating log analytics [21, 22] . Among all development activities, code generation has received much attention due to its potential to reduce development costs. As LLMs are becoming increasingly integral to software development, various techniques have emerged in LLM-based code generation. For example, prompting techniques like few-shot learning [16, 47] have been shown to improve code generation results. In particular, few-shot learning coupled with few-shot sampling [22, 15] or information retrieval augmented technique [25, 4] have been shown to improve code generation. Moreover, one can integrate personalization in the prompt, instructing LLMs to be domain experts in a specific field, which can further improve LLM responses [39, 32] . Such personalization techniques highlight the potential of using multiple LLMs working together to assist in complex software development activities.\nGiven the complexity of software development, LLM agents stand out among various LLM techniques. Agents are LLM instances that can be customized to carry out specific tasks that replicate human workflow [12, 9] . Recently, multi-agent systems have achieved significant progress in solving complex problems in software development by emulating development roles [12, 9, 29] . MetaGPT, introduced by Hong et al. [12] , integrated development workflow using standard operating procedures by assigning specific roles (e.g., a designer or a developer) to LLM agents. Dong et al. [9] developed selfcollaboration, which assign LLM agents to work as distinct \"experts\" for sub-tasks in software development. Qian et al. [29] proposed an end-to-end framework for software development through self-communication among the agents.\nDespite the promising applications of LLMs in automating software engineering tasks, it is pivotal to recognize that software development is a collaborative and multi-faceted endeavor. In the real world, developers and stakeholders work together, following certain software process models like Waterfall, Test-Driven-Development (TDD), and Scrum. The process models help facilitate communication and collaboration to ensure the delivery of high-quality products. Even though there is a common community agreement on the pros and cons of each process model [11] , the impact of adopting these process models for LLM code generation tasks remains unknown.",
        "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the state-of-the-art approach to molecular property prediction (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Gilmer et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019) . A GNN operates on the graph structure of a molecule in two phases. In the message passing phase, a molecular representation is learned by passing messages between atom or bond states. In the readout phase, a feed forward network (FFN) converts this representation into a prediction.\nMotivation. The particular challenges of molecular property prediction marry well with the potential advantages of Bayesian learning. Generalisation is made difficult in cheminformatics by the concept of a molecular scaffold: the structural core of a compound to which functional groups are attached. Highly parameterised GNNs are prone to over-fit to training scaffolds, learning a poor molecular representation and failing to generalise at test time (Yang et al., 2019) . Models are at risk of returning over-confident predictions when operating on new scaffolds, conveying little of the uncertainty associated with a new chemical space. Poorly quantified uncertainty makes it especially challenging to evaluate model robustness and out-of-domain applicability (Hirschfeld et al., 2020) . We believe the best answer to these deficiencies is Bayesian modelling. Whereas a 'classical' neural network bets everything on one hypothesis, a Bayesian approach builds a predictive distribution by considering every possible setting of parameters. Bayesian marginalisation can improve the calibration (Maddox et al., 2019) and accuracy (Izmailov et al., 2019) of deep neural networks underspecified by data. Related work. Two recent studies are particularly pertinent. Firstly, Hirschfeld et al. (2020) benchmark a set of methods for uncertainty quantification in molecular property prediction using the same GNN architecture that we employ in this paper.",
        "Historical archives and libraries contain a large variability of document sources that reflect the memory of the past. The recognition of the scanned images of these documents allows to reconstruct the history. A particular type of archival data are historical photographs which are full of evidence that tells us the story of that snapshot in time. One just needs to pay attention to the subtle cues that are found in different objects that appear in the scene: the clothes that people wear, their haircut styles, the overall environment, the tools and machinery, the natural landscape, etc. All of these visual features are important cues for estimating its creation date. Apart from that, texture and color features might also be of great help to accurately estimate of image creation date since photographic techniques have evolved throughout history and have imprinted a specific date fingerprint on them.\nDate estimation of cultural heritage photographic assets is a complex task that is usually performed by experts (e.g. archivists or genealogists) that exploit their expert knowledge about all the features mentioned above to provide precise date estimations for undated photographs. But their manual labor is costly and time consuming, and automatic image date estimation models are of great interest for dealing with large scale archive processing with minimal human intervention.\nMost approaches in date estimation for historical images try to directly compute the estimation through classification or regression [5, 9, 12] . As alternative of these classical approaches, in this paper we present a method for date estimation of historical photographs in a retrieval scenario. Thus, the date estimation of photographs is incorporated in the ranked results for a given query image. This allows to predict the date of an image contextualized regarding the other photographs of the collection. In the worst case, when the exact date is not exactly estimated, the user can obtain a relative ordering (one photograph is older than another one), which is useful in archival tasks of annotating document sources. The proposed model for historical photograph retrieval is based in a novel ranking loss function smooth-nDCG based on the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain ranking metric, which is able to train our system according to a known relevance feedback; in our case the distance in years between images.\nThe main idea in our approach relies on optimizing rankings such that the closer is image's date to the query's date for a certain photograph the higher will be ranked. When receiving an unknown image as query the method computes the distances towards a support dataset, consisting of a collection of images with known dates.",

        "In 1992, Neal Stephenson introduced the term \"metaverse\" for the first time in his book \"Snow Crash\" [105] . He described the Metaverse as a vast virtual environment where objects are interlinked with the real world and people interact with them via digital avatars. Since its introduction, the Metaverse as a virtual universe has been described by a wide range of ideas that include life-logging technologies, spatial internet and embodied internet, collective virtual space, and a mirror world of simulation and collaboration [186, 152, 22] . Since Mark Zuckerberg, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), affirmed Facebook's rebranding as Meta in October 2021, the brilliant idea behind the new name has gained a lot of attention on social media and sparked a lot of discussions among diverse communities such as academia, enterprise market stakeholders, industry workers, and experts, etc. Besides Meta, several IT sectors have also shown strong interest in this business and are now investing in developing a Metaverse. To exemplify this, Microsoft recently purchased a video game holding company named Activision Blizzard as a piece of the contract to extend virtual gaming or online technology into the Metaverse.\nFollowing the exponential growth of Metaverse, it is likely expected that in the near future, this technology would be pinpointed as a game-changer, because it getting the attention of major stakeholders such as Internet finance companies, online gaming companies, social networks, and many more leading technologies. To continue, the Seoul local government (South Korea) recently announced the Metaverse plan with the intention of creating a virtual communication paradigm for all municipal administrative areas, such as culture, economy, tourism, civic services, and educational activities [197] . Likewise, the report prepared by Bloomberg Intelligence in 2020 [203] , highlights that Metaverse revenue will increase from USD $500 billion to USD $800 billion in 2024, of which half will be from the online game industry. Following this huge revenue, traditional video game companies are planning to shift from their existing gaming framework to a three-dimensional (3D) environment/virtual world in coordination with social networks [110] . Furthermore, some additional new attractive activities, e.g. live entertainment, live gaming, media advertising, and other important events, could further enhance the utilization of this technology in the future [116] .\nAt this point, we are considerably optimistic that the Metaverse technology will contribute significantly in many sectors in the future. However, on the other side, their intrinsic reliance on extensive connectivity and communications exposes them to several security threats that would be damaging factors for its interested stakeholders. Therefore, the security of Metaverse technology requires the special attention of concerned experts, network engineers, and research community stakeholders to gain the trust of clients and enterprise market users. To this end, some efforts have been made to address different security problems. However, the inherent factors, like heterogeneity, dynamic communication, unstructured deployment, interconnectivity of different devices, etc., still offer many security challenges that need to be addressed for the foolproof security of this technology.",
        "Modern AI is based on a pipeline of pre-training general-purpose models on vast amounts of data and then adapting them to specific tasks. Examples across natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) typically focus on withinmodality adaptation across, e.g., tasks or domains, but there is also a recent line of work that looks at leveraging pre-trained models across modalities, e.g., Frozen Pretrained Transformers (FPT) (Lu et al., 2021) , ORCA (Shen et al., 2023) , Om-niPred (Song et al., 2024) , Unified PDE Solver (UPS) (Shen et al., 2024) , inter alia.

First, a pre-trained transformer is selected, and a custom embedder and predictor are created to support any combination of input-output dimensions.

        "This paper studies blind source nonstationary signal separation in which a nonstationary signal is represented as a superposition of Fourier-like oscillatory modes:\nEQUATION\nwith A k (t), \u03c6 k (t) > 0 and A k (t) varying slowly. Such a representation, called an adaptive harmonic model (AHM) representation, is important for extracting information, such as the underlying dynamics, hidden in the nonstationary signal, with the trend A 0 (t), instantaneous amplitudes (IAs) A k (t) and the instantaneous frequencies (IFs) \u03c6 k (t) being used to describe the underlying dynamics.\nIn nature, many real-world phenomena that can be formulated as signals (or in terms of time series) are often affected by a number of factors and appear as time-overlapping multicomponent signals in the form of (1) . A natural approach to understand and process such phenomena is to decompose, or even better, to separate the multicomponent signals into their basic building blocks x k (t) (called components, modes or sub-signals) for extracting the necessary features. Also, for radar, communications, and other applications, signals often appear in multicomponent modes. Since these signals are mainly nonstationary, meaning the amplitudes and/or phases of some or all components change with the time, there have been few effective rigorous methods available for decomposition of them.\nThe empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm along with the Hilbert spectrum analysis (HSA) is a popular method to decompose and analyze nonstationary signals [1] . EMD works like a filter bank [2, 3] to decompose a nonstationary signal into a superposition of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a trend, and then the IF of each IMF is calculated by HSA. There are many articles studying the properties of EMD and variants of EMD have been proposed to improve the performance, see e.g. [2] - [14] . In particular, the separation ability of EMD was discussed in [4] , which shows that EMD cannot decompose two components when their frequencies are close to each other. The ensemble EMD (EEMD) was proposed to suppress noise interferences [5] . The original EMD was extended to multivariate signals in [6, 8, 3] .",

        "The laws of quantum mechanics describe the nature of matter at the microscopic level, and underpin the study of chemistry, condensed matter physics and material science. Although these laws have been known for nearly a century [45] , the fundamental equations are too difficult to solve analytically for all but the simplest systems. In recent years, tools from deep learning have been used to great effect to improve the quality of computational quantum physics [7] . For the study of chemistry in particular, it is the quantum behavior of electrons that matters, which imposes certain constraints on the possible solutions. The use of deep neural networks for successfully computing the quantum behavior of molecules was introduced almost simultaneously by several groups [10, 25, 43] , and has since led to a variety of extensions and improvements [26] . However, follow-up work has mostly focused on applications and iterative improvements to the neural network architectures introduced in the first set of papers.\nAt the same time, neural networks using self-attention layers, like the Transformer [55] , have had a profound impact on much of machine learning. They have led to breakthroughs in natural language processing [13] , language modeling [6] , image recognition [14] , and protein folding [29] . The basic self-attention layer is also permutation equivariant, a useful property for applications to chemistry, where physical quantities should be invariant to the ordering of atoms and electrons [18] . Despite the manifest successes in other fields, no one has yet investigated whether self-attention neural networks are appropriate for approximating solutions in computational quantum mechanics.\nIn this work, we introduce a new self-attention neural network, the Wavefunction Transformer (Psiformer), * Electronic address: {ingridvg,jamessspencer,pfau}@deepmind.com which can be used as an approximate numerical solution (or Ansatz) for the fundamental equations of the quantum mechanics of electrons.",
        "In LAPACK, the routines {S,D,CS,ZD}RSCL scale a complex vector x by the reciprocal of a real number a. This is equivalent to the following code:\ndo i = 1 , n x ( i ) = x ( i ) / a end do\nMore specifically, the routines RSCL do two extra things:\n1. They use the BLAS routine SCAL to do the scaling of the reciprocal of a.\nThus, they use only one division and n multiplications instead of the n divisions in the code above.\n2. The operation (1/a) \u2022 x i can overflow or underflow in finite precision, even when x i /a does not. Therefore, the routines RSCL also check the range of a and scale x by a power of two if necessary. Thus, depending on the value of a, the code will also do extra n multiplications by a power of two.\nAs a result, RSCL are usually faster than the code above. The simple code above, however, is usually more accurate than RSCL since it uses fewer floatingpoint operations. When x is complex, the performance gain is notable since complex divisions are always more expensive than complex multiplications, if we exclude the trivial case where the denominator has zero real or imaginary parts. Moreover, the accuracy loss in the complex case can be negligible since computing a complex division naturally translates to computing a complex multiplication of the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator.\nSome LAPACK routines, like CLARFG and CGETF2, need a reciprocal scaling where both a and x are complex. Since there is no LAPACK routine that does this, CLARFG and CGETF2 have their own (and distinct) way to treat the reciprocal scaling.",
        "Fractional calculus (FC) [1] , a specialized field in mathematical analysis, expands traditional differentiation and integration by embracing non-integer orders. Fractional calculus has gained substantial prominence over four decades. As an evolving arena, FC anticipates the introduction of numerous models for real-world applications in science and engineering, particularly in areas where nonlocality plays a crucial role. This burgeoning field demonstrates profound applications across diverse scientific disciplines, extending its reach into the dynamics of the complex real world, with new ideas implemented and tested using real data. Here, some of these applications are mentioned. In the domain of underwater sediment and biomedical applications, fractional derivative models prove valuable for better understanding wave propagation, providing insights into absorption mechanisms grounded in the relaxation processes observed in materials such as polymers [2] . In [3] , a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) optimal search framework is introduced for specific targets with unknown locations. This approach employs fractional calculus techniques to ascertain optimal distributions for both search length and waiting time.\nFractional order systems, in contrast to memoryless integer-order dynamic systems, feature long memory and the application of fractional calculus improves and extends established control methods and strategies [4] . Its applications in diverse scientific and engineering fields, including image processing [5] , underscore its recognition, providing valuable tools for solving differential equations, integral differential equations, partial differential equations (PDEs), differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), and delay differential equations (DDEs). The utilization of discrete fractional calculus emerges as a practical tool to address engineering challenges in discrete time or space structures, particularly those entailing delays inherent in delay differential equations. This approach provides stability theory for fractional difference equations, facilitating long-term control and mitigating potential errors linked to numerical discretization in continuous fractional calculus [6] .\nDDEs represent a distinct class of differential equations where the unknown functions depend on previous time states, setting them apart from conventional Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). DDEs have diverse applications spanning mathematics, biological systems, engineering, physics, economics and finance, chemical reactions, ecology, communication networks, weather and climate, and medicine [7] [8] [9] . For example, in biological systems, DDEs are used to model the interactions and time delays in predator-prey systems, disease spread, and ecological systems. Also, DDEs are employed to describe neural oscillations and synchronization in the brain, considering the time delays in signal transmission between neurons. In many of these applications, DDEs provide a more accurate representation of real-world phenomena compared to ODEs because they can capture the impact of time delays on system dynamics. In addition to standard delay differential equations, there are several other types of delay equations used in engineering to model systems with time delays. Pantograph delay differential equations (PDDEs) introduce a more intricate structure by incorporating both forward and backward time delays in the equation.",
        "Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) have been proposed in the litterature (Kiess and Mauve 2007 , Reina et al. 2015 , Mohammed and Al-Ghrairi 2019) as a communication technology in the case of emergency and disasters. Indeed, cellular-based infrastructures might become unavailable due to important damages. While MANETs can be quickly deployed without fixed infrastructure, setup or prior requirements, their flexibility is attractive when communications between victims and rescue teams are crucial. However, their implementations face an important challenge: proving that they are enough reliable compared to other approaches (Kiess and Mauve 2007) . While Verification and Validation (V&V) using real experimentations in emergency conditions is utterly impossible, simulation is an important tool in the MANET research community.\nSimulators are an inexpensive manner to evaluate the performance and the accuracy of algorithms and systems without the use of the actual hardware. Also, simulators allow checking the capacity of a network in extreme conditions by varying various parameters in a virtual way and checking different scenarios (Manpreet and Malhotra 2014) . However, although their use and development increased, the credibility of their results decreased over the time (Kurkowski et al. 2005 , Hogie et al. 2006 ). Among the problems encountered arXiv:2004.14093v1 [cs.DC] 29 Apr 2020 during the development of MANETs, some are inherent to simulation in general: repeatability, consistency, and accuracy of the models (Sargent 2001) . Particularly, simulators generally focus only on some aspects of the network structure itself without taking into account the complexity and the heterogeneity of the systems which rely on this network: autonomous vehicles, unmanned aircraft systems, communication software, etc.\nFor instance, Figure 1 shows an exemple of real MANET-based ecosystem in an emergency situation. Collaborative drones evolving in a complex environment must communicate without a fixed network infrastructure, send data to different rescue teams with real-time 3D processing software on mobile devices in order to allow professionals to evaluate the situation. Then, these data should also be saved in a database connected to internet in order to allow management teams to take important decisions. Decision support can also be assessed thanks to an Artificial Intelligence-Driven Decision Making Process (Phillips-Wren and Jain 2006).",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising route towards versatile and dexterous artificial agents. Learning from interactions can lead to robust control strategies that can cope with all the intricacies of the real world that are hard to engineer correctly. Still, many relevant tasks such as object manipulation pose significant challenges for RL. Although impressive results have been achieved using simulation-to-real transfer [1] or heavy physical parallelization [2] , training requires countless hours of interaction. Improving sample efficiency is thus a key concern in RL. In this paper, we approach this issue from a causal inference perspective.\nWhen is an agent in control of its environment? An agent can only influence the environment by its actions. This seemingly trivial observation has the underappreciated aspect that the causal influence of actions is situation dependent. Consider the simple scenario of a robotic arm in front of an object on a table. Clearly, the object can only be moved when contact between the robot and object is made. Generally, there are situations where immediate causal influence is possible, while in others, none is. In this work, we formalize this situation-dependent nature of control and show how it can be exploited to improve the sample efficiency of RL agents. To this end, we derive a measure that captures the causal influence of actions on the environment and devise a practical method to compute it.\nKnowing when the agent has control over an object of interest is important both from a learning and an exploration perspective. The learning algorithm should pay particular attention to these situations because (i) the robot is initially rarely in control of the object of interest, making training inefficient, (ii) physical contacts are hard to model, thus require more effort to learn and (iii) these states are enabling manipulation towards further goals. But for learning to take place, the algorithm first needs data that contains these relevant states. Thus, the agent has to take its causal influence into account already during exploration.\nWe propose several ways in which our measure of causal influence can be integrated into RL algorithms to address both the exploration, and the learning side. For exploration, agents can be rewarded with a bonus for visiting states of causal influence. We show that such a bonus leads the agent to quickly discover useful behavior even in the absence of task-specific rewards. Moreover, our approach allows to explicitly guide the exploration to favor actions with higher predicted causal impact. This works well as an alternative to -greedy exploration, as we demonstrate. Finally, for learning, we propose an off-policy prioritization scheme and show that it reliably improves data efficiency. Each of our investigations is backed by empirical evaluations in robotic manipulation environments and demonstrates a clear improvement of the state-of-the-art with the same generic influence measure.",
        "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable accomplishments across various applications ranging from image recognition (Tan & Le, 2019) , object detection (Tan et al., 2020) , to natural language processing (Devlin et al., 2019) . However, the increasing model size and computational cost of these models become a challenging task for on-device machine learning (ML) endeavours due to the stringent performance per area and energy constraints of the edge devices. To this end, while machine learning practitioners focus on model compression techniques (Han et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2018; Chin et al., 2020) , computer architects investigate hardware architectures to overcome the energy-efficiency problem and improve the overall system performance (Inci & Marculescu, 2018; Inci et al., 2020b; 2021b; 2020a; 2021a) .\nAs computing community hits the limits on consistent performance scaling for traditional architectures, there has been a rising interest on enabling on-device machine learning through custom DNN accelerators. As we deeply care about performance per area and energy-efficiency from a hardware point of view, tailored DNN accelerators have shown significant improvements when compared to CPUs and GPUs (Chen et al., 2016; Jouppi et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2017) . To better understand the trade-offs of various architectural design choices and DNN workloads, there is a need for a design space exploration framework that can rapidly iterate over various designs and generate power, performance, and area (PPA) results. To this end, in this work we present QAPPA, a quantization-aware power, performance, and area modeling framework for DNN accelerators. This work makes the following contributions:\n\u2022 We present QAPPA, a quantization-aware power, performance, and area modeling framework for DNN accelerators.",
        "Astrophysics, and solar physics in particular, is an observational science in which we cannot change the experimental conditions, we simply observe. Therefore, the only way of learning is by confronting observations with state-of-theart theoretical modeling. The models are then tuned until the observations are explained and conclusions are drawn from this comparison. As a consequence, our understanding of the universe is based on the availability of data.\nThe amount of data available until the final decades of the 20th century was very reduced and could easily be stored in relatively standard storage media, from notebooks, books or small computing centers. The scarcity of data forced researchers to use strongly informed generative models based on our theoretical advances, with a heavy use of inductive biases1 . This is necessary to allow generalization of the conclusions. From a probabilistic point of view, generative models are a way to describe the joint probability p(x, y), where x are the observations and y are the parameters of the model. The everincreasing quality of the observations allowed researchers to propose more and more complex physical scenarios to be compared with observations. Solar physics is rapidly entering into the big data era, an era dominated by the availability of data, which cannot fit in current computers and have to be stored, in many cases, in a distributed manner. The storage and access to this data is a technological challenge and has not been completely solved in our Fig. 1 Categories of machine learning (ML): supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning and unsupervised learning have deep roots in the field of statistical learning (Hastie et al., 2009) , while reinforcement learning has strong connections with control theory.\nfield. For example, access to the curated Solar Dynamics Observatory dataset of Galvez et al. (2019a) implies downloading 6.5 TB of data. Unless a dedicated connection is used, the transfer and local storage of all this data is hard.",
        "Color vision deficiency (CVD, color blindness) is the failure or decreased ability to distinguish between colors under normal illumination. There are over 300 million people with CVD, including approx. 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 250 women (0.5%) [1] [2] [3] . CVD is an X-linked genetic disorder impacting both eyes with varying degrees of prevalence in different populations [4] . It affects an individual's ability to perform tasks in both personal and professional settings [5] .\nColor is an important asset in user interface (UI) design [6] , and while the exact impact of color is known to vary between demographics [7] , applications still often rely on established conventions, such as green and red indicating 'yes' and 'no' respectively. Objects of the same color satisfy the Gestalt principle of similarity, whereas different colors can help an object stand out or mark figure-ground articulation [8] . With the ever-increasing color gamut of novel displays [9] , new domains are opening up in the use of color; however, some of these domains simply cannot be seen by someone with CVD.\nAccessibility is the concept of making UIs equally usable by all types of users, enabling user interactions without barriers. UI designers have the option to support accessibility for CVD users pre-publication or post-publication [10] , with pre-publication normally resorting to a limited and fixed color palette [2] , and post-production relying on automatic recoloring [11] also known as daltonization [12] . A hybrid, low-effort approach is to provide support for the operating system's high contrast mode. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) [6] outline some best practices for accessibility; however, these often only target core functionality. Another consideration for UI is perceived aesthetics. Many designers see aesthetics as inversely proportional to functionality [13] , while other evidence points towards a positive correlation between functionality and aesthetics [14] [15] [16] . In the domain of CVD, a high contrast theme is rarely a top-priority feature, which could imply that people with CVD have a substantially reduced aesthetic experience. However, there is insufficient data to understand CVD users' perceived functionality and aesthetics of UIs.\nA comparative study of UI functionality and aesthetics is inherently challenging. Individuals with CVD cannot judge if a reduced-dimensionality UI they see is equally usable or aesthetic compared to a UI they could never see. Therefore, we instead built on the successful field of physiologically-based CVD simulations and asked 19 non-CVD participants to compare reference UIs to how they might appear to a CVD observer for 20 popular UIs (1449 data points in total). Specifically, we measured mean-opinion scores for functionality and the probability of maintained aesthetics.",
        "Machine learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a powerful method for generative modeling [9] . A GAN consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, and applies adversarial learning to optimize their parameters. The generator is trained to transform its inputs from a random latent space into \"artificial/fake\" samples that approximate the true distribution. The discriminator is trained to correctly distinguish the \"natural/real\" samples from the ones produced by the generator. Formulated as a minmax optimization problem through the definitions of generator and discriminator loss, training can converge on an optimal generator that is able to fool the discriminator.\nGANs are difficult to train. The adversarial dynamics introduce convergence pathologies [5, 14] . This is mainly because the generator and the discriminator are differentiable networks, their weights are updated by using (variants of) simultaneous gradient-based methods to optimize the minmax objective, that rarely converges to an equilibrium. Thus, different approaches have been proposed to improve the convergence and the robustness in GAN training [7, 15, 18, 20, 26] .\nA promising research line is the application of distributed competitive coevolutionary algorithms (Comp-COEA). Fostering an arm-race of a population of generators against a population of discriminators, these methods optimize the minmax objective of GAN training. Spatially distributed populations (cellular algorithms) are effective at mitigating and resolving the COEAs pathologies attributed to a lack of diversity [19] , which are similar to the ones observed in GAN training. Lipizzaner [1, 22] is a spatial distributed Comp-COEA that locates the individuals of both populations on a spatial grid (each cell contains a GAN). In a cell, each generator is evaluated against all the discriminators of its neighborhood, the same with the discriminator. It uses neighborhood communication to propagate models and foster diversity in the sub-populations. Moreover, the selection pressure helps the convergence in the sub-populations [2] .\nHere, we evaluate the impact of neighborhood communication and selection pressure on this type of GAN training. We conduct an ablation analysis to evaluate different combinations of these two components. We ask the following research questions: RQ1: What is the effect on the quality of the generators when training with communication or isolation and the presence or absence of selection pressure?.",

        "Survival analysis, also known as time-to-event analysis, is one of the primary statistical approaches for analyzing data on time to event (Cox, 1975; Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 2011) . It is usually adopted in medical fields to analyze clinical materials and assist doctors in understanding disease prognosis (Wulczyn et al., 2021) . Histological whole-slide image (WSI) is one of these materials. It is produced by scanning tissue slides (millimeter scale) with a high-end microscope. Compared with other materials like demographics and genomics, digitized WSIs can present unique hierarchical views at a gigapixelresolution (Zarella et al., 2018) , e.g., tissue phenotype, tumor microenvironment, and cellular morphology. These rich and diverse microscopic information could provide valuable cues for the prognosis of tumor diseases (Yu et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2022c) , contributing to the improvement of patient management and disease outcomes (Nir et al., 2018; Kather et al., 2019; Skrede et al., 2020) .\nUnlike regular natural images, histological WSIs are usually with an extremely-high resolution, e.g., 40,000 \u00d7 40,000 pix- els. This poses great challenges to WSI analysis and modeling, especially the global representation learning of WSIs. To tackle these challenges, many methods follow a weakly-supervised framework with three stages: i) WSI patching, ii) patch-level feature extracting, and iii) slide-level representation learning (Chen et al., 2022b; Ghaffari Laleh et al., 2022) . In procedure, this framework derives global representations through building patch correlations, learning patch-level embeddings, and aggregating patch-level embeddings, as shown in Figure 1 . It is often cast as embedding-level multiple instance learning (MIL) (Ilse et al., 2018; Carbonneau et al., 2018) . According to the Figure 2 : The commonalities of existing WSI survival analysis models in terms of output and input: (a) model output, existing methods are limited to a point time-to-event estimation, whereas ours can provide an estimation of time-to-event distribution, believed to be more robust and interpretable; (b) model input, all the most frequently-used datasets for WSI survival analysis are at a very small scale, usually with around 500 patients or 1,000 slides.",
        "The sun has a major impact on Earth: It provides the light and energy that are vital to life on our planet and dramatically shapes Earth's climate. However, the sun's activity is evolving and its dynamics can be in the state of quiet or disturbed. Its disturbances is associated with an intense localized eruption of plasma in form of solar flares [1] . The emanated solar flares are accompanied with coronal mass ejections, solar particle events, and other solar phenomenon that are potentially harmful to spacecraft technology and astronauts in space. To understand the dynamical evolution of the sun's activity and its associated space weather conditions. The imagery from the solar observatory is one of the most important sources of information about the activity of the sun. As a result, the National Aeronautics Space Agency (NASA), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) captures approximately 70,000 images of the sun activity in a day [2] . Notably, the continuous visual inspection of these solar observatory images regarding the sun activity is challenging. There is need to develop an approach that can automatically detect/track the sun's activity for a more defined and robust search of the space weather. Different methods of classifying, detecting and capturing the activity of the sun have been proposed by several authors using Spectrogram, Image processing, Deep learning, Neural Network, and Machine Learning [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . For instance, in the work of Yang et al. [10] the authors used simulated Annealing Genetic (SAG) method to detect the umbra and penumbra of sunspots simultaneously. Full-disk continuum intensity images obtained from SDO/HMI from May, 2010-December 2016 was used. Their detection results showed that the dual thresholds derived from SAG method have outstanding performance in segmenting the umbra and penumbra from the photosphere with a satisfactory robustness efficiently. Armstrong and Fletcher, [11] applied a deep convolutional neural network to extract features and process images from Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope (SOT). Solar features comprising of filaments, prominence, flare ribbons, sunspots and quiet sun was considered.",
        "With the advancement of foundation models, improvements in semi-and unsupervised learning methods can shift from end-to-end training towards decision making over the foundation models' latent spaces (Oquab et al.

I S n } and a target dataset T = {I T 1 , . . . I T m }. These datasets share the same set of classes {C 1 . . . C k }, however the training labels are only known for the source dataset. The problem is, given a classifier trained on a source dataset, to adapt it, without any target data labels, to classify data on a target dataset.\nMany of the existing works targeting UDA focus on representation learning approach towards assimilating, in the feature space, the source and target data (Saenko et al. (2010) ). For many contem-Figure 1 : The methodology scheme: (1) the images from multiple domains (e.g., sketches and real images) are embedded into the feature space and, for each domain, separately clustered using kmeans.

        "The deep learning features [1] , which are extracted with deep neural networks learned from abundant training data, have essential differences compared with handcrafted features, e.g., Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) [2] and Scale-Invariant Feature (SIFT) [3] . With the unprecedented success of deep learning in various computer vision tasks as well as the development of network infrastructure, there is an increasing demand to study the deep learning feature compression in the Analysis-then-Compress (ATC) [4] paradigm. In particular, in contrast with Compress-then-Analysis (CTA) paradigm where the videos would be first acquired at frontend sensors then compressed and transmitted to the cloud-end for analysis purposes, ATC allows the straightforward feature extraction at the front-end, leading to a much more compact representation of videos by transmitting the features instead of textures. In view of this advantage, the ATC paradigm with both handcrafted and deep learning features has been widely studied to address the challenges of video big data in various application scenarios.\nIn the literature, there are numerous algorithms proposed for compact feature representation of both handcrafted and deep features. Hash-based model DBH [5] and vector quantization based models, such as product quantization (PQ) [6] optimized product quantization (OPQ) [7] , target at the compact representation of handcrafted features. Moreover, binary based descriptors such as BRIEF [8] and USB [9] have been proposed for high-efficiency Hamming distance computation. Regarding deep learning features, Ding et al. [10] applied the philosophy of video coding to compact deep learning feature representation. The deep hashing network (DHN) [11] combined supervised learning with hash compression to achieve performance promotion for image feature representation. Besides, Chen et al. also proposed an intermediate deep feature compression towards intelligent sensing in [12] .\nThe promising characteristics of ATC paradigm motivate the standardization of the compact feature representation. In particular, the Compact Descriptor for Visual Search (CDVS) and Compact Descriptors for Video Analysis (CDVA) standards completed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), define the standardized bitstream syntax such that the interoperability could be enabled in image/video retrieval applications. In 2019, the MPEG initiated the standardization of video coding for machine (VCM) [13, 14] , aiming to achieve high accuracy, low latency, object oriented analysis based on compact video representation for machine vision.",
        "The application of the sequence-to-sequence architecture [1] to ASR and TTS models paved way to perform self-supervised training by simple integration of ASR and TTS. Recent works on self-supervised training [2, 3, 4, 5] leveraging unpaired speech and text have shown higher performance compared to other unsupervised training approaches. Most of the research in self-supervised ASR is done in effectively integrating ASR and TTS such that it is differentiable [6] and easily trainable. However, ASR and TTS are exploited in disconnected fashion by synthesizing speech using TTS [7, 8, 9] and improving ASR through data augmentation. These techniques focus on the synthesis part and rely on text only data from unpaired sets to improve recognition performance. The work in [10] also improves ASR performance, by using a language model as a hypothesis scorer and applying self-training techniques over the resulting corrected pseudo-labels. In [11] , the authors apply self-supervision through pre-training with the help of a BERT model to improve ASR performance with unpaired data. BERT has also been used as a effective pre-training technique with contrastive loss in [12] by training in self-supervised fashion.\nA recent work [13] on semi-supervised sequence-to-sequence ASR has applied consistency training and has shown effectiveness with unlabeled speech data.

        "Driven by advances in deep neural network (DNN) compression schemes, rapid progress has been made in finding high-performing lossy compression schemes for large, high-dimensional datasets that remain practical [1] - [4] . While these methods have empirically shown to outperform classical compression schemes for real-world data (e.g. images), it remains unknown as to how well they perform in comparison to the fundamental limit, which is given by the rate-distortion function. To investigate this question, one approach is to examine a stylized data source with a known probability distribution that is analytically tractable, such as the sawbridge random process, as done in [5] . This allows for a closed-form solution of the rate-distortion function; one can then compare it with empirically achievable rate and distortion of DNN compressors trained on realizations of the source. However, this approach does not evaluate DNN compressors on true sources of interest, such as real-world images, for which architectural choices such as convolutional layers have been engineered [6] . Thus, evaluating the rate-distortion function on these sources is paramount to understanding the efficacy of DNN compressors on real-world data.\nFurthermore, a class of information-theoretically designed one-shot lossy source codes with near-optimal rate-distortion guarantees, which fall under the area of reverse channel coding [7] - [15] , can provide a one-shot benchmark for DNN compressors, which are typically one-shot. However, these schemes require the rate-distortion-achieving conditional distribution (see (1) ), which is generally intractable for real-world data, especially when the data distribution is unknown and only samples are available. Having the ability to recover the rate-distortion function's optimizing conditional distribution only from samples, in addition to the rate-distortion function itself, would allow for implementation of reverse channel codes even without access to the full data distribution.\nConsider an independent and identically-distributed (i.i.d.) data source X \u223c P X , where P X is a probability distribution supported on alphabet X . Let Y be the reproduction alphabet, and d : X \u00d7Y \u2192 R + be a distortion function on the input and output alphabets. The asymptotic limit on the minimum number of bits required to achieve a distortion D is given by the rate-distortion function [16] - [18] , defined as R(D) := inf\nEQUATION\nAny rate-distortion pair (R, D) satisfying R > R(D) is achievable by some lossy source code, and no code can achieve a rate-distortion less than R(D). It is important to note that R(D) is achievable only under asymptotic blocklengths, whereas DNN compressors are typically one-shot, as compressing i.i.d. blocks for real-world datasets may not be feasible.",

Meanwhile, a safe control policy is imperative for a robot in the real world, as dangerous behaviors can cause irreparable damage or costly losses. Therefore, the RL methods that can provide a safety guarantee for robot control have received considerable interest and progress [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] .\nA recent line of work focuses on designing novel RL algorithms, e.g., actor-critic, for constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). In these methods, the system encourages the satisfaction of the constraints by adding a constant penalty to the objective function [6] or constructing safety critics while doing policy optimization in a multi-objective manner [5] , [7] , [11] , [12] . Although these approaches are attractive for their generality and simplicity, they either need model [6] , or only encourage the safety constraints to be satisfied probabilistically.\nAn alternative type of methods focuses on reachability and safety guarantee (sufficient conditions) by constructing/learning control Lyapunov functions (CLF) and control barrier functions (CBF) that can respectively certify the reachability and safety [8] , [10] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . The relevant safe controllers are normally designed by adding a safety filter to a reference controller, such as a RL Fig. 1 . The 2D quadrotor navigation task. Lines stand for trajectories. The circles are the initial position. The blue regions represent obstacles. Video is available at https://youtu.be/_8Yr_QRRYik. controller [8] , [10] , [13] , a model predictive control (MPC) controller [14] , etc. Unfortunately, these approaches have two disadvantages: (1) there might be conflicts between CLFs and CBFs as separate certificates [19] , [20] (see Figure 2 in Section V-A); (2) the CLFs and CBFs are generally nontrivial to find [19] , especially for nonlinear systems. Even though there are learning methods to find CLFs and CBFs, knowledge of dynamic models has to be explicitly used [21] .\nIn this paper, we propose a data-based reachability and safety theorem without explicitly using the knowledge of a dynamic system model.",
        "The use of serial manipulators is well established for handling tasks in automation and production environments. However, for large-scale manipulation the workspace and payload of serial robots are limited. These disadvantages can be overcome by using cable-driven parallel robots (short: cable robots) that use cables instead of rigid prismatic actuators to control an end-effector. Due to their flexibility and low weight, cables can be stored compactly on drums so that high maximum actuation length and acceleration can be reached. Thus, a large geometric workspace can be made possible. A well-known example for a large-scale cable robot is FAST [7] , which is a spherical radio telescope with a span width of 600 m and a payload of approx. 30 t. Other examples are the Robotic Seabed Cleaning Platform (RSCP) [2] for removing marine litter and high rack warehouse solutions [4] . Efficient operation is essential for the handling tasks of robotic systems. A high accuracy is required for loading and unloading objects, while the motion between handling operations does not require high accuracies, but low energy consumption is necessary. For cable robots, increasing the platform stiffness leads to a more precise operation and higher energy consumption, whereas decreasing leads to a low energy consumption due to lower cable force and also lower accuracy [8] . High energy consumption can be assumed by applying high cable forces on the platform, which require high motor torques and therefore also high motor currents. Conversely, low energy consumption can be achieved with low cable forces.\nParallel cable robots are redundant mechanisms with number of actuated cables m \u2265 n + 1, whereby the platform can be manipulated with n degrees of freedoms (DOFs). Verhoeven [16] already describes that cable robots have the potential to increase or decrease the cable preload and consequently adjusting the platform stiffness by exploiting the nullspace. Later, Kraus et al. [6] presented an energy efficient computation method of the force distribution of a cable robot.",
        "Recently, researchers successfully applied Semantic methods to Genetic Programming (SGP) on different domains, showing promising results [1, 2, 3] . While the classic GP operators (e.g., selection, crossover and mutation) act at the syntactic level, blindly to the semantic (behavior) of the individuals (e.g., programs), the key idea of SGP is to apply semantic evaluations [1] . More specifically, classic GP operators ignore the behavioral characteristic of the offspring, focusing only on improving the fitness of the individuals. Differently, SGP uses a richer feedback during the evolution that incorporates semantic awareness, which has the potential to improve the power of genetic programming [1] .\nIn this paper, we are considering the Symbolic Regression domain, and thus assuming the availability of training cases (defined as m pairs of inputs and desired output). Following the most popular SGP approaches [1] , we intend \"semantics\" as the set of output values of a program on the training cases [4] . Such an approach obtains a richer feedback during the evolution relying on the This is the authors version of this work. It was later published in: European Conference on Genetic Programming (EuroGP '20) evaluation of the individuals on the training cases. More formally, the semantics of an individual I is a vector sem(I) = y 1 , y 2 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , y m of responses to the m inputs of the training cases. Let sem(\u0177) = \u01771 , \u01772 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , \u0177m denote the semantic vector of the target (as defined in the training set), where \u01771 , \u01772 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , \u0177m are the desired outputs. SGP defines semantic space [1] with a metric that characterizes the distance between the semantic vectors of the individuals sem(I) and the target sem(\u0177). SGP often relies on such a distance to compute the fitness score, inducing a unimodal fitness landscape, which avoids local optima by construction [5] .",
        "Each time a cell senses changes in its environment, it marshals a complex choreography of molecular interactions to initiate an appropriate response. When a virus infects the cell, this delicate balance is disrupted and can result in a cascade of systemic failures leading to disease. In particular, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has a complex etiology that differs in subtle and substantial ways from previously studied viruses. To make informed decisions about the risk that a new pathogen presents, it is imperative to rapidly predict the determinants of pathogenesis and identify potential targets for medical countermeasures. Current solutions for this task include systems biology data-driven models, which correlate biomolecular expression to pathogenicity, but cannot go beyond associations in the data to reason about causes of the disease [1] , [2] . Alternatively, hypothesis-driven mathematical models capture causal relations, but are hampered by limited parameter identifiability and predictive power [3] , [4] .\nWe argue that counterfactual inference [5] helps bridge the gap between data-driven and hypothesis-driven approaches. It enables questions of the form: \"Had we known the eventual outcome of a patient, what would we have done differently?\" At the heart of counterfactual inference is a formalism known as a structural causal model (SCM) [5] , [6] . It represents prior domain knowledge in terms of causal diagrams, assumes a probability distribution on exogenous variables, and assigns a deterministic function to endogenous variables. SCM are particularly attractive in systems biology, where structured domain knowledge is extracted from the biomedical literature and is readily available through advances in natural language processing [7] , [8] , [9] , large-scale automated assembly systems [10] , and semiautomated curation workflows [11] . This knowledge is curated by multiple organizations [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] and stored in structured knowledge bases [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] . It can be brought to bear for answering causal questions regarding SARS-CoV-2.",
        "Nowadays, combinatorial optimization (CO) is an interdisciplinary field spanning optimization, operations research, discrete mathematics, and computer science, with many critical real-world applications such as vehicle routing or scheduling; see, e.g., (Korte and Vygen 2012) for a general overview. Mixed-integer programming technology offers a generic way of formulating and solving CO problems by relying on combinatorial solvers based on tree search algorithms, such as branch and cut, see, e.g., (Nemhauser and Wolsey 1988; Schrijver 1999; Bertsimas and Weismantel 2005) . Given enough time, these algorithms find certifiably optimal solutions to NP-hard problems. However, many essential decisions in the search process, e.g., node and variable selection, are based on heuristics (Lodi 2013) . The design of these heuristics relies on intuition and empirical evidence, largely ignoring that, in practice, one often repeatedly solves problem instances that share patterns and characteristics. Machine learning approaches have emerged to address this shortcoming, enhancing state-of-the-art solvers with data-driven insights (Bengio, Lodi, and Prouvost 2021; Cappart et al. 2021; Kotary et al. 2021) .\nMany CO problems can be naturally described using graphs, either as direct input (e.g., routing on road networks) or by encoding variable-constraint interactions (e.g., of a MILP model) as a bipartite graph. As such, machine learning approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) (Gilmer et al. 2017; Scarselli et al. 2009 ) have recently helped bridge the gap between machine learning, relational inputs, and combinatorial optimization (Cappart et al. 2021) . GNNs compute vectorial representations of each node in the input graph in a permutationequivariant fashion by iteratively aggregating features of neighboring nodes.",
        "Ecosystems and human activities on the Earth's surface are constantly changing. Obtaining accurate information on surface changes in real-time is essential to understanding and studying human activities, the natural environment, and their interactions (Coppin et al., 2004) . Remote sensing technology is a powerful tool that allows for large-scale, longterm, periodic observations of the Earth's surface, making it a vital tool for studying changes in the Earth's ecosystem and human society. As such, detecting land-cover changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images acquired by sensors mounted on spaceborne and airborne remote sensing platforms has become a topic of great interest in the field of remote sensing (Tewkesbury et al., 2015; Zhu, 2017) .\nAs one of the earliest and most widely used technologies in the field of remote sensing, there have been numerous approaches and paradigms developed for change detection. Before the advent of deep learning techniques, traditional change detection methods could be roughly classified into four types: image algebra methods, image transformation methods, post-classification comparison methods, and other Manuscript submitted on May 23, 2023. * Corresponding author ORCID(s): 0000-0003-0100-4786 (H. Chen) advanced methods. Image algebra methods measure the change intensity by directly comparing spectral bands of bitemporal images. The most classic method in this category is change vector analysis (CVA) (Bovolo and Bruzzone, 2007; Bruzzone and Diego Fern\u00e0ndez Prieto, 2000; Du et al., 2020) . Image transformation methods aim to extract features that are beneficial for change detection by transforming the raw image features into a new feature space. Representative methods include multivariate alteration detection (MAD) (Nielsen et al., 1998) , principal component analysis (PCA) (Celik, 2009; Deng et al., 2008) , slow feature analysis (SFA) (Wu et al., 2014) , Fourier transform (Chen et al., 2023) , and so on. Post-classification comparison methods first execute classification algorithms to obtain classification maps and then compare the classification maps to generate change maps (Xian et al., 2009) . Other advanced methods mainly include the utilization of machine learning models such as support vector machine (Bovolo et al., 2008) , conditional random field (Hoberg et al., 2015) , Markov random field (Kasetkasem and Varshney, 2002) , and the object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods for change detection (Gil-Yepes et al., 2016; Hussain et al., 2013) .\nThe emergence of deep learning techniques in recent years has brought about new paradigms and solutions to change detection, resulting in improved efficiency and accuracy in analyzing multi-temporal remote sensing imagery (Shi et al., 2020) . These deep learning-based methods can be categorized into unsupervised and supervised types, depending on whether prior annotated information is provided to the change detector. For unsupervised methods based on deep learning, the primary research direction is to develop or utilize deep learning models to extract spatialspectral features from multi-temporal remote sensing images and subsequently employ models or operations to calculate change intensity from these features. In (Zhang et al., 2016a) , the deep belief network (DBN) was used to extract features from bi-temporal images for change detection.",
        "The fastest-growing mode in urban mobility is on-demand mobility, mostly realized by transportation network companies like Uber or Lyft. Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) has an advantage over private vehicles in reducing the fleet size (and consequently, the parking space) due to carsharing: one car can serve many travel requests during one day. Moreover, some MoD options (e.g., Uber Pool) allow users to share rides (ridesharing), and, as a result, they reduce the total distance driven over traveling separately.\nOne of the key problems regarding MoD systems is to determine the minimal vehicle fleet able to serve all travel requests: the fleet sizing problem.\nBy reducing the fleet size, we can reduce the capital cost of the system by reducing the number of vehicles and the parking space needed. Moreover, we can reduce the operational cost by reducing the number of drivers needed.\nAnother important problem is the vehicle dispatching: a problem of assigning vehicles to requests and determining the vehicle plans (routes). This problem is very complex especially when ridesharing is employed, as the number of possible plans grows exponentially with the number of requests. In operational research field, this problem is known as the dial-a-ride problem (DARP). By providing high-quality vehicle dispatching solutions, we can reduce the operational cost of the system by reducing the total distance driven by the vehicles. Moreover, by sharing rides, we can even reduce the required fleet size with all the benefits mentioned above.\nIn the MoD context, we often need to connect vehicle plans to longer plans. For example, we can connect one vehicle plan starting at 7:00 and ending at 8:00 to another plan starting at 8:30 and ending at 9:00, resulting in a plan starting at 7:00 and ending at 9:00.",
        "In kinematics, robotics and mechanism science Hamiltonian quaternions and dual quaternions have been employed to parametrize the group of Euclidean displacements SE(3) as well as its subgroups SO(3) and SE (2) . The rich algebraic structure of the quaternion models allow to investigate certain problems from an algebraic point of view. Rational motions can be represented by polynomials over the ring of quaternions or dual quaternions. In this context, factorization of a polynomial into polynomials of lower degree corresponds to the decomposition of a rational motion into \"simpler\" motions. One of the simplest non-trivial motions are rotations. They can be represented by linear polynomials. On the other hand, linear polynomials generically represent rotational motions. Hence, a motion described by a polynomial that admits a factorization into linear factors can be realized by a mechanism whose revolute joints correspond to the linear factors.\nA suitable model for motions in the hyperbolic plane is provided by the noncommutative ring of split quaternions [2, Chapter 8] . In contrast to the (Hamiltonian) quaternions, the presence of zero divisors makes the factorization theory of polynomials over split quaternions more complex. Factorization of quadratic split quaternion polynomials has been investigated in [1] and [3] . Zeros of split quaternion polynomials of higher degree (which are closely related to linear factors, c.f. Lemma 2.9) are the topic of [7] . Based on the theory of motion factorization by means of quaternions [8, 14] and dual quaternions [9, 12] a characterization of factorizability for such polynomials has been found [15] . In order to compute factorizations, the algorithm of the Euclidean setup has been adapted [11, 15] .\nIn this article, we consider rational motions in the hyperbolic plane, represented by polynomials over the split quaternions. We extend the results from the quadratic case [15] to polynomials of arbitrary degree. A main ingredient is a geometric interpretation of factorizability. We investigate the \"geometry\" of the factorization algorithm for generic cases and modify it such that it provably finds all factorizations into linear factors. Special cases include polynomials with infinitely many factorizations or no factorizations at all.\nIn case a split quaternion polynomial representing a rational motion has no factorization with linear factors we can adopt a \"degree elevation technique\" from the Euclidean setup [12] : Multiplying with a suitable real polynomial does not change the underlying rational motion but allows the decomposition into linear factors. Hence, the initial motion can be decomposed into hyperbolic rotations.",
        "E LECTROMAGNETIC (EM) medical imaging in the microwave band is a relatively new modality, finding applications in the detection and characterisation of breast cancers [1] , [2] , [3] , ischemic and haemorrhagic strokes [4] , [5] , [6] , and torso imaging applications [7] , [8] . The physical phenomenon that enables this modality is that the dielectric permittivity and conductivity of human tissues vary considerably over the microwave frequency band, particularly between healthy and unhealthy tissues. After transmitting and receiving signals through the body using antennas in known positions with known properties, an inverse scattering problem might be utilized. The solution of this problem can yield an image of the dielectric properties of the body under test, and hence the position of different tissue regions, allowing for disease localisation.\nThe imaging techniques currently reported in the literature typically require a priori information about the propagation or scattering model of the imaging domain. The dire need for prior information stems from the fact that solving inverse scattering problem is an expensive computational process that requires the estimation of a large number of unknowns (dielectric properties of tissues). In [9] the authors suggest estimating 'entry points' of signal into the object to aid a decluttering mechanism. Introducing the boundary of the imaged object to the imaging algorithm can enhance its detection accuracy by providing a more accurate propagation model. Moreover, it can reduce the computational complexity of the problem by reducing the dimension of the search space. Last but not least, the vast majority of imaging techniques in biomedical settings use some 'decluttering' mechanism to focus on a target that is typically the pathology [10] . This decluttering process physically corresponds to removal of some aspect of the scanned object, e.g. effect of skull reflections in head imaging. As such, the output image only shows the anomaly and lacks the boundaries of the imaged object. This is not palatable to clinicians as it lacks context [11] , [12] . Thus, object boundary finds its place as one aspires to construct a holistic image as a final outcome. The collection of boundary information in a clinical environment where the subject's movement is not controllable is a difficult process. Using laser sensors [13] is the most accurate strategy for the detection of the object's surface in current literature.",
        "Entropy is popularly construed as a measure of disorder. Here we show that it can also be seen as a measure of uniformity and symmetry. As shown explicitly below, when unconstrained, entropy maximization yields a uniform, equal-weight, or translation invariant distribution. Meanwhile, information lowers entropy, imposing certain nonuniformities. Symmetries, if viewed as uniformities across certain transformations or translations, would then naturally correspond to states of higher entropy. Thus, the ubiquity of symmetries in physics may not point to a delicate and precarious balance mysteriously maintained by Nature, but to a state of maximal entropy given the information imposed by the external forces or constraints. When stricter constraints are imposed on a system, certain symmetries naturally break, but the system tends to the most \"uniform\" or \"symmetric\" distribution while satisfying those new constraints. Entropy, symmetry, and information are ubiquitous precisely because they are fundamental. Even in a purely mathematical sense, the symmetries present in a certain theory can be viewed as dual to the axiomatic constraints defining that theory. Thus, while not the subject of this work, defining an entropy to compare the symmetries of different theories may be a way to classify those theories, similar to the Erlangen program in geometry [Kle93, Kt93, EL45] .\nContradictory heuristics and claims have appeared in the scientific literature regarding the relationship between entropy and symmetry. For example, while [Lin96] asserts that entropy is (positively) correlated with measures of symmetry and similarity, others claim that symmetry lowers entropy [Bor20] .\nThese views can be reconciled in light of the duality of entropy and information. If the symmetry is in the information-for example, by imposing that certain symmetry-obeying states be equal-then this certainly lowers entropy since it constrains the space to a particular subspace exhibiting that particular symmetry. However, having more symmetries in the state space, in the sense of giving equal weight to more points in the space, uniformizes the space, increasing its entropy.\nPut differently, one needs less information to encode a system that has many symmetries than one with little or no symmetries, and less information means more entropy, but imposing symmetric information (restricting to particular symmetric states) lowers entropy, as would any information.",
        "Watching long videos is time-consuming and easily loses user attention. How to efficiently present videos to users is an important and practical problem in various video applications. For example, for home surveillance videos which are usually recorded continuously throughout the day, it is hard for users to capture a moment of package delivery from an hour-long video. More generally speaking, for videos that are not carefully edited (e.g., Youtube videos), they often contain purposeless parts and need pre-processing of content so that users can quickly get meaningful information.\nVideos often come from different modalities. Commonly, they are composed of image frame sequences. With the advances of recording devices and editing tools, videos often contain speech (e.g., Youtube videos recorded from user phones) and subtitles (e.g., in movies and TV-shows). It has been shown that leveraging different modalities benefits various video tasks [14, 22] . However, it is worthwhile noticing that the various modalities in video could We study the Sparsified VideoQA problem, where we learn to sparsify the original long video into very few inputs for QA. We design a video sparsification process to deal with video of multiple modalities (frames, word and phrase descriptions, etc).\nbe quite noisy and redundant -meaningless utterances, repeating frames, etc. -causing computational inefficiency and distracting model learning. Furthermore, the problem of modality imbalance [4] has been studied, where the unbalanced information across modalities could result in significant bias towards one modality. For example, prior works [12] have shown that in TV-related videos, the major contribution for the various video-language tasks comes from subtitles while the video frames play a negligible role.\nIn this work, we characterize the VideoQA problem from the perspective of input sparsity. As illustrated in Figure 1 , we aim to answer the question: \"How much visual/textual signals are sufficient for a task?\" For VideoQA specifically, different questions require different amount of video information to give the answer. For example, if the question asks about people, then theoretically the system only needs to look at the moments where people are present. In the literature, there is evidence showing that video action classification can be accomplished with single frame [5, 20] . Recently there have also been works that imply sparse uniform sampling of the video is sufficient for video and language tasks [10] , and an analysis tool which shows that video and language tasks could be achieved by picking one optimal frame [1] . In this work, we instead move beyond single frame input, and try to characterize the role of videos by learning to select an optimal set of video inputs. We propose a generic framework which learns to drop video inputs while training for the video-and-language task. This framework can be applied to different kind of video modalities, and in our experiments we provide analysis on visual-only (i.e., video frames), text-only (i.e., video subtitles or key words), and visual-textual inputs.\nFrom our experiments, we demonstrate that with very sparse inputs, the task can still be accomplished pretty well. Specifically, we are able to achieve 5.2%-5.8% loss of accuracy with only 10% length of the video, which corresponds to only 2-4 selected frames.",
        "Images have been getting increasingly larger over the past decade. Images captured by consumer cameras on smartphones now capture images at 4K resolution (roughly 8.3M pixels) while professional DSLR cameras capture images at 8K resolution. Elsewhere, sensors on satellites and microscopes capture images with over a billion pixels.\nModern computer vision pipelines are limited by the memory in the systems they are trained upon, resulting in the creation of models that only operate on small images.\nComputer vision practitioners limit the size of images in two less-than-ideal ways: down-sampling or cropping. While these simple operations produce powerful models when measured against typical computer vision benchmarks, the loss of high frequency information or global context is limited for many real-world tasks. Consider a video feed of a football game. Captured natively in 8K resolution, a model attempting to answer the question of where a player on the left side of the screen will pass the ball to on the right side of screen will not be able to reason over the entire image in one pass. The image, the downstream model, and all intermediate tensors cannot fit in the memory of modern, large VRAM GPUs. A common approach is to process the image by treating it as individual \"windows\", each fed through the model without sharing context, resulting in sub-optimal performance.\nWe introduce xT, a framework by which myopic vision backbones can effectively integrate local and global context over large images. In particular,we tackle both issues of quadratically-increasing GPU memory utilization and the integration of context across very large images. We achieve this by improving the strengths of hierarchical vision backbones [21, 30] through nested tokenization of images and processing resulting features with long-sequence models, The key is our nested tokenization of large images at multiple levels: at the region level as input R 0 , . . . , R 8 (R, . . . , R + 8 for readability) for the region encoders, and then at the patch level R i 0 , . . . , R i P -1 inside the encoders to understand local details. The image regions then undergo independent, hierarchical encoding, by passing through a vision backbone that serves as a region encoder. Hierarchical region encoders result in down-sampled features which, when combined with context encoders, allows us to process more regions at once than typically possible. One such context encoder, Transformer-XL, is illustrated in Stage 2. It recurrently processes previous prior sequence tokens using cross attention, extending its context range significantly with depth. The resulting sequence has assimilated both local and global context and is finally fed to a task-specific decoder.",
        "Vehicle routing problem (VRP) [1] is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem in which the objective is to find a set of routes with minimal total costs. For every route, the total demand cannot exceed the capacity of the vehicle. In literature, the algorithms for solving VRP can be divided into exact and heuristic algorithms. The exact algorithms provide optimal guaranteed solutions but are infeasible to tackle large-scale instances due to high computational complexity, while the heuristic algorithms are often fast but without theoretical guarantee. Considering the trade-off between optimality and computational costs, heuristic algorithms can find a suboptimal solution within an acceptable running time for large-scale instances. However, it is non-trivial to design a good heuristic algorithm, since it requires substantial problem-specific expert knowledge and hand-crafted features. Designing a heuristic algorithm is a tedious process, can we learn a heuristic automatically without human intervention? Motivated by recent advancements in machine learning, especially deep learning, there have been some works [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] on using end-to-end neural network to directly learn heuristics from data without any hand-engineered reasoning. Specifically, taking VRP for example, as shown in Fig. 1 , the instance is a set of nodes, and the optimal solution is a permutation of these nodes, which can be seen as a sequence of decisions. Therefore, VRP can be viewed as a decision making problem that can be solved by reinforcement learning. From the perspective of reinforcement learning, typically, the state is viewed as the partial solution of instance and the features of each node, the action is the choice of next node to visit, the reward is the negative tour length, and the policy corresponds to heuristic strategy which is parameterized by a neural network.",
        "It is well known that safety of complex hybrid systems, such as cyber-physical systems (whether autonomous or not), cannot be achieved with just simulation and testing [8, 10] . The space of possible behaviors is so big that testing and simulation cannot provide sufficient coverage. Achieving high confidence in correctness requires the ability to model the system mathematically and to prove its properties with an aid of an automated reasoning system. Moreover, cyberphysical systems operate in uncertain environments and even modeling such system is a nontrivial task. Thus, we need a system that is able to reason about properties that incorporate such uncertainties.\nDifferential Dynamic Logic (dDL) has proven a useful tool for certifying hybrid systems [15, 16] , with a practical implementation in the KeYmaera theorem prover [17] . This is a logic in the style of Propositional Dynamic Logic [5] , with the addition of programs x = \u03b8dt & H that allow the state to evolve continuously according to a differential equation x = \u03b8 for some non-deterministic amount of time, as long as boundary condition H is satisfied. Part of the reason that dDL has been successful in practice is the substantial amount of work done on its theory since it was first proposed. Notably, uniform substitution-based reasoning [15] allowed a more concise axiomatization of dDL and enabled the move from KeYmaera to KeYmaera X [6] with a much smaller trusted code base. The same paper introduced differential forms to the calculus, a syntactic way of reasoning about the derivatives of the continuous dynamics, instead of moving them into side-conditions. More recently, the introduction of definite descriptions in dL i [3] allowed for reasoning about terms of the form \"the unique x such that P \". This provides a way to reason about terms that may not be defined everywhere, but are necessary in practice, such as square roots.\ndDL and its simplest probabilistic extensions can only reason about those systems whose continuous behavior is fully deterministic. However, many hybrid systems are best modeled using continuous stochastic processes. This may be because they are deployed in a setting where the underlying dynamics are stochastic, such as in processes interacting with physical materials with stochastic properties, or with financial markets -or because they represent a controller acting under measurement uncertainty. Reasoning about such systems in a dDL style was formulated in Stochastic Differential Dynamic Logic [12, 13] . Here, the continuous programs are generalized to stochastic differential equations of the form x = \u03b8dt + \u03c3dW , expressing the change of x in time as depending on not only \u03b8, but also on \u03c3 and some underlying continuous stochastic process W .",

[3] , stereo-vision system proposed by Sabe et al. [4] , or infrared (IR) camera combined with ultrasound sensors proposed by Chen et al. [5] . Several works estimate the surface for legged robot locomotion through evaluation of joint position [6] . Camurri et al. [7] developed a Pronto state estimator for legged robots that can integrate pose corrections from the RGB camera, LIDAR, and odometry feedback. Sarkisov et al. [8] introduced a novel landing gear that allows surface profile estimation based on foot-pad IMU orientation and joint angles. Zhang et al. [9] explored visual-based estimation of the tactile patterns by designing a robotic skin with a painted inner surface and installing a camera inside the robot leg. Smith et al. [10] suggested coupling data from foot contact sensors and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to teach quadruped robot locomotion skills via Reinforcement Learning. A hybrid tactile sensor-based system was proposed by Luneckas et al. [11] , which are used in hexapod-legged robots to overcome obstacles. The sensor was designed to combine a limit switch and flexible polypropylene material that was connected with foot by silicone material, allowing the robot to estimate solid ground obstacles. Legged robots are currently using direct feedback from the environment such as sonar, vision, LIDAR, and force feedback from joint actuators. Tactile sensors have recently been applied to expand the awareness of collaborative robots to its environment by feedback from a skin-like surface. In case of the legged robot, such sensors may be used beneath the robot's feet to estimate the properties of the surface.",
        "Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is an important task in computer vision, which involves object detection and tracking multiple objects over time in an image sequence. It can be applied to several real-world scenarios, such as video surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and sports analysis. Despite numerous research methods proposed for MOT, the problem of fragmented tracklets or ID switching caused by frequent occlusion in crowded scenes remains a major challenge. One potential solution is to track objects under a multi-camera setting, which is called a Multi-Camera Multi-Object Tracking (MC-MOT) task. By leveraging information from multiple cameras, occluded objects in one view may become clearly visible in another view, allowing for more accurate object tracking results.\nMost of tracking-by-detection paradigms [1] adopt Kalman filter [17] in the data association stage. It serves as a motion model, predicting the next possible position and matching with previous detection. However, such method is usually deterministic and cannot adapt to the dynamically changing environment. In addition, the tracking results are difficult to achieve globally optimal, since the illumi-nation, relative geometry distance, or sampling rate varies from dataset to dataset, which is common in real-world scenarios. Accordingly, there is another fashion reformulating the association problem into link prediction on graph [5, 18, 25, 27] . It allows a trainable model to determine how strong the connection is between two detections. Thus, objects can be dynamically associated depending on environmental conditions.\nHowever, there still remains some issues in current graph-based models for MC-MOT. First of all, many approaches rely on single-camera tracker to generate the initial tracklets [13, 25, 27, 37] . Although many methods have been proposed to refine tracklets, tracking errors in singleview are often left unaddressed. Additionally, these methods do not fully leverage the rich spatial and temporal information that is crucial for MC-MOT task. Recently, spatialtemporal models have been employed to learn representative features for tracklets. However, the resulting graphs are usually complex and hard to optimize.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Reconfigurable Spatial-Temporal graph model (ReST) for MC-MOT to overcome the problems mentioned above. The MC-MOT problem is re-formulated as two sub-tasks, Spatial Association and Temporal Association, in our approach. In Spatial Association, it focuses on matching objects across different views. Temporal Association exploits temporal information, such as speed and time, to build temporal graph which associates objects across frames. By splitting the problem into two sub-tasks, spatial and temporal consistency can be individually optimized to achieve better tracking results. In addition, the graph model becomes smaller and easy to optimize. To bridge two association stages, Graph Reconfiguration module is proposed to aggregate information from spatial and temporal graph models. The merits of involving graph reconfiguration are two-fold. Firstly, when the nodes of the same object are merged, the reconfigured graph becomes very compact. Secondly, the refinement of the graph model can be iteratively performed in each reconfiguration step during inference, leading to more representative feature extraction and better tracking results. As depicted in Figure 1a , when the girl is occluded, fragmented tracklets are produced, causing the ID switch problem. In Figure 1b , correct object ID can be retained by employing spatial and temporal consistency via Spatial Association, Temporal Association, and Graph Reconfiguration modules.\nThe proposed graph model is called reconfigurable because the vertex set and edge set of spatial and temporal graphs are reconfigured to construct a new graph at each time.",
        "The Graph structures are commonly found in various application scenarios [1, 2, 24] , and the use of graph neural networks has gained increasing attention due to their ability to leverage the power of graph structures. Graphs can model pairwise relationships between entities, but they are unable to capture highorder relationships among multiple entities [3, 4, 5, 6] . As a generalized structure of graphs, hypergraphs define hyperedge, as a collection of nodes, that can connect more than two nodes. Therefore, extending graph neural networks (GNNs) to hypergraphs enables the handling of multi-modal data and the capture of high-order correlations in the data [23, 27] .\nHowever, the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to hypergraphs presents a challenge due to the high-order relationships among multiple nodes represented by hyperedges.\nTo address this, one must either preprocess the hypergraph structure to obtain a format compatible with graph convolution or define convolution operations directly on the hypergraph [15, 28] . It requires preprocessing the hyper-graph structure to obtain a format that is compatible with graph convolution or defining convolution operations directly on the hypergraph [27, 28] . One straightforward approach is to transform the hypergraph into a simple graph that accurately represents the hypergraph while retaining as much information as possible [7, 8, 9, 12] . This simple graph only contains pairwise relationships, enabling the application of a graph neural network (GNN). Alternatively, convolution operations can be directly defined on the hypergraph structure without converting it into a simple graph [17, 18, 19, 20] . This method preserves the comprehensive semantic relationships between nodes and the higher-order relationships within the hypergraph, avoiding loss of information [20] .\nAlthough the above methods have achieved promising results, they primarily focus on information propagation between nodes and hyperedges, neglecting the interaction among hyperedges. However, the interaction between hyperedges can effectively model the high-order interactions among diverse entities/nodes that widely exist in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the hyperedge features, as representations of these sets of nodes, can effectively indicate the collective characteristics of the nodes within them, which can be further utilized for subsequent operations and downstream tasks. Therefore, it is valuable to incorporate hyperedge interactions into hypergraph convolution to capture rich hyperedge information.\nIn this paper, we propose a Hyperedge Interaction-aware Hypergraph Neural Network (HeIHNN) model, to learn hypergraph representation. Specifically, our approach integrates the interactions between hyperedges into the hypergraph convolution process by designing a three-stage hypergraph information propagation process: node-to-hyperedge (N2HE), hyperedge-to-hyperedge (HE2HE), and hyperedge-to-node (HE2N). Firstly, we aggregate the information from all nodes within each hyperedge to update the embedding of the hyperedge. Next, we construct a hyperedge interaction graph based on the relationships between hyperedges, enabling the convolutional propagation of information at the hyperedge level. Lastly, we update the embeddings of all nodes within the hyperedges using the acquired hyperedge features. For each stage, we design corresponding convolutions and incorporate attention mechanisms to capture the significance of different components. Additionally, we propose a hyperedge outlier removal mechanism that dynamically adjusts the hypergraph structure by identifying and removing outliers within the hyperedges during the information propagation between nodes and hyperedges. To evaluate the performance of HeIHNN, we conduct experiments on five realworld datasets and compare our results with existing models.",
        "Live commenting is an emerging feature of online video sites that allows real-time comments to fly across the screen or roll at the right side of the videos, so that viewers can see comments and videos at the same time. Automatic live commenting aims to provide some additional opinions of videos and respond to live comments from other viewers, which encourages users engagement on online video sites. Automatic live commenting is also a good testbed of a model's ability of dealing with multi-modality information [16] . It requires the model to understand the vision, text, and audio, and organize the language to produce the comments of the videos. Therefore, it is an interesting and important task for human-AI interaction.\nAlthough great progress has been made in multimodal learning [15, 24, 25] , live commenting is still a challenging task. Recent work on live commenting implements an encoder-decoder model to generate the comments [16] . However, these methods do not model the interaction between the videos and the comments explicitly. Therefore, the generated comments are often general to any videos and irrelevant to the specific input videos. Figure 1 shows an example of the generated comments by an encoder-decoder model. It shows that the encoder-decoder model tends to output the popular sentences, such as \"Oh my God !\", while the reference comment is much more informative and relevant to the video. The reason is that the encoder-decoder model cares more about the language model, rather than the interaction between the videos and the comments, so 1 Harbin Institute of Technology, China, email: cqduan@stu.hit.edu.cn 2 Microsoft Research Asia, China, email: lecu@microsoft.com 3 Microsoft Research Asia, China, email: Shuming.Ma@microsoft.com 4 Microsoft Research Asia, China, email: fuwei@microsoft.com 5 Harbin Institute of Technology, China, email: conghui@hit.edu.cn 6 Harbin Institute of Technology, China, email: tjzhao@hit.edu.cn Case 1 Oh My God !!!!! Case 2\nSo am I. Reference The cat is afraid of spicy. generating popular comments is a safe way for the model to reduce the empirical risk. As a result, the encoder-decoder model is more likely to generate a frequent sentence, rather than an informative and relevant comment.\nAnother problem with current state-of-the-art live commenting models is that they do not take the audio into consideration.",
        "Consider the problem of assigning a label to an object. In applications where the label noise is low, predicting a single label works well. However, in a wide range of applications, at least some data items may be ambiguous due to noise or occlusion. In such cases, even expert human annotators may disagree on what the true label should be and may prefer to give a list of possible answers, while filtering out the classes that certainly are wrong.\nResearchers have found that even on simple tasks, such as CIFAR-10, humans sometimes disagree (Peterson et al., 2019) . This is illustrated in Figure 1 which shows images with different levels of disagreement according to annotators. The first row displays unambiguous images, whereas the second and third rows contain images with, respectively, two and three possible classes. In all cases, a single object is present in the image, however, for some images, (c) Ambiguity among three classes.\nFigure 1: Various degrees of ambiguity according to human annotators on CIFAR-10 collected by Peterson et al. (2019) . The orange class corresponds to the most probable class according to these annotators. Comparison of error rate of the top-K strategy with the average-K strategy studied in this paper computed on the human uncertainty annotations of CIFAR-10H (Peterson et al., 2019) . Lower is better.\nthe low image resolution does not allow a person to determine precisely what this object is.1 However, filtering (ruling out some classes) is still useful when there is ambiguity.\nIn this paper, we study an adaptive classification approach where computational classifiers are allowed to act like human experts by responding with a list of candidate labels. The size of the list may vary depending on the sample being classified but is constrained to have a mean value of K. The value K may be related to the resources available to validate or exclude each candidate classification (e.g., in a medical setting where validating each possible diagnosis may require one or more specialized tests). We denote this as average-K classification, a generalization of top-K classification.\nIn our problem setting, as in Figure 1 , there is a single correct label, but the input provided may be ambiguous. This is a different task from multi-label classification (Zhang and Zhou, 2013) where there are multiple true answers, all of them correct, which are given during training. Figure 2 shows how, on CIFAR-10H, an adaptive average-K strategy has the potential to lower the error rate compared to always predicting the same number of classes for each sample.\nThe paper is organized as follows. After formalizing the average-K classification task, we determine the contexts in which the adaptive strategy is most beneficial compared to top-K classification. Moreover, we give estimation procedures to estimate those strategies and show that they are consistent.",
        "The goal of estimating the 3D room layout by an indoor RGB image is to locate the corners or the floor-boundary and ceiling-boundary, as shown in Fig. 3a , which plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding [24] . The panoramic images have wider (360 \u2022 ) field of view (FoV) than perspective images and contain the whole-room contextual information [30] . With the development of deep neural networks and the popularity of panoramic cameras in recent years, 3D room layout estimation by a single panorama has made great achievements [23, 28, 32] .\nMost room layouts conform to the Atlanta World assumption [20] with horizontal floor and ceiling, along with * Corresponding author. The network estimates the room layout from a single panorama using the omnidirectional-geometry aware loss of horizon-depth and room height and the planar-geometry aware loss of normals and gradients of normals. We visualize the predicted boundaries (green) by the horizon-depth and room height, and the floor plan (red) with post-processing by Manhattan constraint, finally output the 3D room layout.\nvertical walls [18] . Thus the room layout can be represented by floor-boundary and room height, as shown in Fig. 3a . However, previous approaches [23, 24, 26] estimate the room height by ceiling-boundary. And the networks predict the floor-boundary and ceiling-boundary with the same output branch, which affects each other since they need to predict both horizontal shape and vertical height of room layout. Meanwhile, most previous approaches [23, 28, 32] use Manhattan constraint [3] or directly simplify boundaries [18] in post-processing without considering the planar attribute of the walls to constrain the network output results. In addition, for models [23, 24, 26] which formulate the room layout estimation task as 1D sequence prediction, a sequence processor is needed to model the geometry relationship. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) [11, 21] is used in [23, 26] . Transformer [25] is an efficient framework for sequence processing and has made great success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Vision Transformer (ViT) [5] has demonstrated strong abilities in the computer vision field recently. Nevertheless, there is no specially designed Transformer architecture for panoramas as we know. Due to the above problems, we propose an efficient network called LGT-Net for panoramic room layout estimation. It contains a feature extractor to convert the panorama to feature sequence and a Transformer architecture as sequence processor.",
        "The nature of the world that autonomous vehicles operate in is highly dynamic. To be able to successfully and safely navigate in these dynamic environments, several challenges need to be addressed, such as detection [1] , [2] , tracking [3] , [4] , prediction [5] , [6] , and planning [7] , [8] to name a few.\nRecently, contributions to the field of autonomous vehicle technology from the open-source community have played a significant role in addressing some of these challenges. These contributions have come in the form of open-source datasets, such as Argoverse2 [9] , Waymo Open Dataset [10] , and NuPlan [11] . These datasets contain meticulously labeled sensor data and high-definition mapping information, among a multitude of other information required by an autonomous vehicle to safely and reliably navigate.\nHigh-definition maps are a crucial component within these datasets, and they are integral to the operation of autonomy stacks, as demonstrated by methods like [12] , [13] , [14] , which facilitate global planning for point-to-point navigation. These maps provide detailed lane-level definitions and road network connectivity information, offering context for prediction models and aiding planning models in trajectory generation and optimization tasks.\nHowever, it's important to note that these applications often operate under the assumption of a static world. In practice, this assumption can be challenged by changes in the road layout or temporary constructions, leading to potential failures. Given the substantial disparities between these static map definitions and the evolving real-world conditions, autonomous agents would struggle to devise feasible trajectories without continuously updating their knowledge of the static map features. This underscores the critical importance of dynamic and real-time scene comprehension.\nTo explore dynamic scene modeling strategies, this work presents three key contributions to the open-source research community, namely\n\u2022 A publicly available dataset automatically labeled by utilizing vector map data from the Argoverse2 sensor dataset.",
        "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance when both train and test sets share the same distribution. However, domain shift, i.e. change in data distribution between train (source domain) and test (target domain) sets, significantly deteriorates the generalizability [1, 2] . This issue is particularly pronounced in multi-center medical studies, where various imaging centers employ different scanners, protocols, and subject populations [2, 3] .\nUnsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) [1, 2] aims to generalize large-scale models, pre-trained on the source domain to an unlabeled target domain, eliminating the need for costly data annotation. It is typically achieved through fine-tuning, where a model pre-trained on the source domain is adapted to target domains. However, a major downside of fine-tuning is that it results in a dedicated model for each target domain with the same parameters as the original pre-trained model [4, 5] . Consequently, several target domains would require several dedicated models with the same parameter count as the original pre-trained model.\nThus UDA methods can be effective for single-target DA, resulting in a single model for a specific target domain. Conversely, in multi-target DA (MTDA) the objective is to adapt to multiple unlabeled target domains. MTDA has a broader applicability to real-world scenarios. However, training separate models for each target domain with the same trainable parameters as the source model is impractical and prohibitively expensive.\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has demonstrated its effectiveness as a fine-tuning strategy for Large Language Models (LLMs) [6] . Unlike conventional fine-tuning, it keeps the majority of the model parameters frozen while adapting a substantially reduced number of parameters, often less than 5% of the total. This enables both efficient learning and faster updates. PEFT also outperforms full fine-tuning and enhances generalization, particularly in low-data scenarios [6] .\nIn the field of medical imaging, only a few methods have used adapter-based PEFT in Transformer-based architectures [7, 8] . These works focus on achieving parameter-efficient transfer learning from natural images to medical images. To the best of our knowledge, both the application of PEFT in medical imaging in the context of UDA, and the use of adapterbased methods in CNNs have not yet been explored [9] .\nHaving identified this research gap, we propose a novel parameter-efficient MT UDA for medical image segmentation, that is computationally efficient and also has low-memory footprint. First, we propose Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (ConvLoRA), as an adaptation of Low-Rank Domain Adaptation (LoRA) in LLMs [4] .",
        "I NTELLIGENT reflecting surface (IRS) has recently at- tracted growing attention and is envisioned as an innovative technology for the beyond fifth-generation (B5G) communication system, due to its potential of achieving significant improvement in communication coverage, throughput, and energy efficiency [1] - [3] . Specifically, IRS is a planar metasurface composed of a large number of reconfigurable passive elements, which are attached with a smart controller to enable dynamic adjustment on the signal reflections for different purposes, such as signal power enhancement and interference suppression. In particular, compared to conventional techniques such as active relaying/beamforming, IRS not only reflects signals in a full-duplex and noise-free manner without incurring self-interference, but also greatly saves energy consumption and hardware/deployment cost by using lightweight passive components only [1] , [3] .\nOn the other hand, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has also received significant attention and shown superiority over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in conventional wireless systems without IRS, for improving the spectral efficiency, balancing user fairness, and enlarging network connections. In the downlink NOMA, the user of stronger channel with the base station (BS) or access point (AP) employs the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique to cancel the cochannel interference from the users of weaker channels, prior to decoding its own message. As a result, the decoding order depends on user channel power gains, which are determined by the propagation environments and user locations. In contrast, since IRS is capable of reconfiguring user channels by controlling the reflected signal amplitudes and/or phase shifts, the user decoding order of NOMA can be permuted by adjusting the IRS reflection to achieve more flexible performance tradeoffs among the users.",
        "When low-resolution images are zoomed using upscaling techniques such as Lanczos resampling and interpolation, they become pixelated instead of providing more information. Super Resolution (SR) is an image processing technique that generates a higher resolution image from single or multiple low-resolution (LR) input images. Super\nResolution aims at adding pixel density and high-frequency content (such as textures and edges) in the LR image. SR finds tremendous utility in areas where attention to detail is of utmost importance. Some of these include medical imagery, forensic analysis of surveillance feeds, satellite images, biometric systems, and person identification, etc. This paper specifically focuses on the use of SR algorithms in offline forensic analysis of surveillance feeds. Due to its inherent nature, the surveillance environment mostly has uncontrolled and sporadic dynamics. Furthermore, the quality of a surveillance feed is affected by factors such as occlusions, type of camera hardware, camera pose, limited bandwidth, varying illumination conditions, and background complexity. These factors affect the process of identifying and monitoring individuals and various related activities in the surveillance feeds. Therefore, acquiring a generic model for varying surveillance environments is a complex task. For the proposed research work, we have inspected the effectiveness of four conventional, yet effective vision-based and three deep learning-based SR algorithms. The objective of this research work is to seek the finest method that executes well in a surveillance environment with limited training data options. To relate limited training data available for a specific surveillance environment a subset of 220 images from 6 different public datasets was selected along with some test images acquired from local settings.",

A fundamental result derived in [5] states there is no universal programmable quantum processor that operates with finite-dimensional program states. Since a quantum processor is universal if it can implement any quantum operation, this conclusion implies that the exact simulation of an arbitrary quantum channel on a single programmable quantum processor is impossible.

        "The standard paradigm for evaluating natural language processing (NLP) models is to compute correctness metrics on a held-out test set from the same distribution as the training set (Linzen, 2020). If the test set is large and diverse, this may be a good measure of average performance, but it fails to account for the worst-case performance (Sagawa 1 Our code is available on https://github.com/ peluz/beluga. et al., 2020) . By exploiting correlations in the training data, models work well in most cases but fail in those where the correlations do not hold (Niven and Kao, 2019; McCoy et al., 2019; Zellers et al., 2019) , leading to overestimation of model performance in the wild (Ribeiro et al., 2020) . Furthermore, standard evaluation does not indicate the sources of model failure (Wu et al., 2019) and disregards important model properties such as fairness (Ma et al., 2021) .\nBehavioural testing (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2021; Ribeiro et al., 2020) has been proposed as a complementary evaluation framework, where model capabilities are systematically validated by examining its responses to specific stimuli. This is done through test suites composed of input-output pairs where the input addresses specific linguistic or social phenomena and the output is the expected behaviour given the input. The suites can be seen as controlled challenge datasets (Belinkov and Glass, 2019) aligned with human intuitions about how the agent should perform the task (Linzen, 2020) .\nIn this work, we understand test suites as a hierarchy of functionality classes, functionalities, and test cases (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2021) . Functionality classes stand at the highest level, capturing system capabilities like fairness, robustness and negation. They are composed of functionalities that target finergrained facets of the capability. For example, a test suite for sentiment analysis can include the functionality \"negation of positive statement should be negative\" inside the Negation class. Finally, each functionality is composed of test cases, the inputoutput pairs used to validate model behaviour. For the functionality above, an example test case could be the input \"The movie was not good\" and the expected output \"negative\", under the assumption that the non-negated sentence is positive.\nThough behavioural test suites identify model weaknesses, the question of what to do with such feedback is not trivial. While test suite creators argue that these tools can aid the development of better models (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2021) and lead to improvements in the tested tasks (Ribeiro et al., 2020) , how to act on the feedback concretely is not discussed.",
        "One important concern in robotics is the mapping relationship between a joint space and the pose space of its endeffector, which is commonly referred to as the kinematics problem. The solution of the kinematics problem is integral to both motion planning and control in robotics. Notably, the kinematic analysis of robots with complex or closedloop structures can be a challenging task. The Gough-Stewart platform (GSP) [1] is one of the classic parallel mechanisms that features a closed-loop design. As a result of the distinct characteristics of parallel robot structures, determining its forward kinematics problem can be exceptionally complicated [2] . While various works have been proposed to address this problem, there is currently no universally acknowledged method that can guarantee both the precision and efficiency of the solution simultaneously. There is still a strong desire in the parallel manipulator community to explore novel and stronger forward kinematics methods.\nNeural networks (NNs) are a well recognized method for learning the mapping relationship and performing realtime solution. For forward kinematics learning in parallel manipulator, this started by via a single layer of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) [3] , [4] . In the study of non-parallel structures [5] , [6] , NNs are also employed to solve forward Fig. 1 : The pipeline of our proposed forward kinematics solver for the Gough-Stewart platform.\nkinematics. Despite NNs have cracked up new avenues for addressing complex mechanisms' forward kinematics, the majority of NNs in employ are intuitive MLPs with Euler angles as the output representation. On limited dataset, achieving high-precision pose outputs is difficult with this traditional learning method. The primary reason is that traditional MLPs have weak inductive biases [7] on the one hand. Inductive biases in deep neural networks are vital to many advances. Directly regressing rotation, on the other hand, requires the finding of better differentiable non-Euclidean representations, i.e., the rotation representation of the NN must be beyond four dimensions [8] .\nMotivated by exploring a network that can provide both high-precision pose outputs and real-time solutions. We attempt to take advantage of the complex structure of parallel manipulators to build a graph and apply message-passing graph neural network (GNN) to learn. Since its permutation equivariance, GNN has been successfully applied in numerous of fields [9] . Applying GNN techniques, however, raises an important question: for forward kinematics learning, what should be the input representation for GNN? GNNs typically use node coordinates as input features, but in forward kinematics, the robot's coordinate information are not known in advance. In the case of GSP, the physical connection lengths are more widely known. To overcome the challenge of unknown coordinate information, we opt for the graph distance matrix as the input for GNN in this work.\nRecently, several studies have shown that traditional GNNs struggle to use the distance matrix adequately to learn geometric information [10] - [12] . This limitation follows primarily from traditional GNNs' limited expressive power [12] . To explore better ways of utilizing the distance matrix as input for learning, li et al. [13] employed the k-WL/FWL algorithm to construct k-DisGNNs and achieved promising results. Inspired by this work, we use the k-FWL algorithm [14] to construct a high expressive power Distance Graph Neural Network (DisGNet) for forward kinematics learning. The rotation in DisGNet is represented through 9D-SVD orthogonalization [15] . DisGNet possesses a similar number of parameters as traditional MLP methods but achieves highprecision pose outputs.",
        "Deep neural networks have proven incredibly powerful in a huge range of machine-learning tasks. However, deep neural networks are highly sensitive to small input perturbations that cause the network's accuracy to plummet (Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Szegedy et al., 2013) . In the context of natural language processing, these adversarial examples come in the form of spelling mistakes, use of synonyms, etc.-essentially, meaning-preserving transformations that cause the network to change its prediction (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a; Michel et al., 2019) .\nIn this paper, we are interested in the problem of training models over natural language-or, generally, sequences over a finite alphabet-that are robust to adversarial examples. Sequences over finite alphabets are unique in that the space of adversarial examples is discrete and therefore hard to explore efficiently using gradient-based optimization as in the computer-vision setting. The common approach to achieving robustness is adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018) , which has seen a great deal of research in computer vision and, more recently, in natural language processing (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a; Michel et al., 2019) . Suppose we have defined a space of perturbations R(x) of a sample x-e.g., if x is a sentence, R(x) contains every possible misspelling of words in x, up to some bound on the number of misspellings. The idea of adversarial training is to model an adversary within the training objective function: Instead of computing the loss for a sample (x, y) from the dataset, we compute the loss for the worst-case perturbed sample z \u2208 R(x). Formally, the adversarial loss for (x, y) is max z\u2208R(x) L(z, y, \u03b8).\nThe question we ask in this paper is:\nCan we train models that are robust against rich perturbation spaces over strings?\nThe practical challenge in answering this question is computing the worst-case loss. This is because the perturbation space R(x) can be enormous and therefore impractical to enumerate. This is particularly true for NLP tasks, where the perturbation space R(x) should contain inputs that are semantically equivalent to x-e.g., variations of the sentence x with typos or words replaced by synonyms. Therefore, we need to approximate the adversarial loss. There are two such classes of approximation techniques:\nAugmentation The first class of techniques computes a lower bound on the adversarial loss by exploring a finite number of points in R(x). This is usually done by applying a gradient-based attack, like Hot-Flip (Ebrahimi et al., 2018) for natural-language tasks or PGD (Madry et al., 2018) for computer-vision tasks.\nWe call this class of techniques augmentation-based, as they essentially search for a perturbed sample with which to augment the training set. upper bound on the adversarial loss by overapproximating, or abstracting, the perturbation space R(x) into a set of symbolic constraints that can be efficiently propagated through the network. For example, the interval abstraction has been used in numerous works (Mirman et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019) .\nWe call this class of techniques abstraction-based.\nBoth classes of techniques can produce suboptimal results: augmentation can severely underapproximate the worstcase loss and abstraction can severely overapproximate the loss.",
        "In this paper we study the numerical minimization of the Canham-Helfrich-Evans [9, 24, 29] bending energy W(\u2202\u2126) = 2\u03ba b \u2202\u2126 (H -H 0 ) 2 ds, \u2126 \u2282 R 3 bounded domain, (1.1) subject to the following volume and area constraints\nEQUATION\nwhere the positive constants V 0 , A 0 > 0 obey the isoperimetric inequality\nEQUATION\nHere H := 1 2 (\u03ba 1 + \u03ba 2 ) denotes the mean curvature of \u2202\u2126, \u03ba 1 and \u03ba 2 its principal curvatures, 2H 0 the so-called spontaneous curvature (H 0 is half the spontaneous curvature), and \u03ba b a bending elastic constant. Henceforth we will use the abbreviation S := \u2202\u2126 keeping in mind that S is the surface enclosing the volume \u2126. The Energy (1.1) was proposed to model membranes such as vesicles and red-blood cells [29, 40] . The numerical treatment of this problem is not straight-forward since the computation of the mean curvature typically involves the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the normal field, which would involve fourth order derivatives of the surface coordinates and thus requires a certain smoothness of the (discretized) surface. Typically shapes are approximated with continuous, non-smooth triangulations (mostly linear or quadratic ones) leading to the fundamental and non-trivial question of computing/approximating the appropriate curvature. Nevertheless, several approaches to tackle this problem have been proposed. For a recent comprehensive review of the Canham-Helfrich-Evans energy including various numerical approaches we refer to [28] .\nA variety of methods are based on the approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator by means of discrete differential geometry (DDG) [39, 27, 59 ]. The minimization is then achieved by e.g., differentiating the discrete energy with respect to the nodes and follow a negative gradient, see [3] for a comparison with several established numerical approximation schemes minimizing the Canham-Helfrich-Evans energy. A popular discretization scheme for the Laplace-Beltrami operator is the finite difference cotangent method on a Voronoi area entailing also a direct computation of a possibly involved Gaussian curvature in terms of the angle deficit, used e.g. in [4, 6, 52] .\nThe shape derivative of geometric quantities and the full Canham-Helfrich-Evans energy has been computed, e.g., in [10, 17, 33, 58] involving fourth order derivatives and the Gauss curvature of the shape. Beside boundary integral methods [45, 57, 25] , procedures based on surface finite element methods (SFEM) [22, 23] approximate the surface of the shape with (possible high-order curved) isoperimetric elements. For linear triangulation the discrete normal vectors are sometimes averaged giving the possibility of computing the weak gradient globally [1] . For higher polynomial orders, however, the shape derivative yields complicated expressions due to the (nonlinear) averaging procedure.",
        "Nanopore sequencing [1] has emerged as a promising technology for the sequencing of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), however it is limited by many distortions imposed by the physics of the sequencer. Thus far, a complete model of the nanopore sequencer has not been established in the research community, hence the purpose of this paper is to introduce a model that is suitable for the future development of codes that enable reliable data storage in synthetic DNA when using nanopore sequencing for the reading operation [2] .\nThe four molecules adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T ), connected to a sugar-phosphate backbone molecule, form the nucleotides (or bases), which are the primary elements of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Abstractly, we can assume {A, T, C, G} is the alphabet forming arbitrary length sequences.\nThe nanopore is a microscopic pore that holds \u03c4 nucleotides (see Fig. 1 ) for a random duration determined by a motor protein that shifts nucleotides one by one through the nanopore. Meanwhile, an ionic electrical current flowing through the nanopore is uniquely disturbed by the \u03c4 nucleotides inside it at any given time, and is sampled by the sequencer at a frequency f s . Measuring the current level through an output function f , the nanopore sequencer estimates the state of the system defined by the \u03c4 bases in the nanopore. Unfortunately, the following distortions reduce the reliability of detection [3] :\nRandom dwell times (sample duplications): Fluctuations in the motor protein operation results in a random number of samples per nucleotide, since the nucleotide is not being shifted in lockstep with the sampler. Fading: For each nucleotide, the motor is designed to halt for a duration that facilitates the sampling of a constant Fig. 1 : A diagram of the noisy nanopore channel of Definition 1. The -th base in the ssDNA is fed through the nanopore after K /f s seconds, according to the variable \"DNA Clock\". Simultaneously, the sampler samples every 1/f s seconds, according to the \"Sample Clock\" with frequency f s . current level. However, minor variability in the physical dimensions of the nanopores slightly changes this level. This is similar to a variable fading coefficient depending on the nanopore in use.\nInter-symbol interference (ISI): Given that the electrical current is disturbed by \u03c4 bases, the detection of a single base is distorted by inter-symbol interference with its neighbours.\nNoisy measurements: Finally, each sample is distorted by measurement noise. From experimental data, the authors of [3] additionally observed backsteps (tandem duplications) and, less frequently, skippings (deletions).",
        "One of the central objectives in statistical learning theory is to establish generalization error bounds for learning algorithms to assess the difference between the population risk of learned parameters and their empirical risk on training data. Ever since Bousquet and Elisseeff [4] unveiled a fundamental connection between generalization error and algorithmic stability, which gauges a learning algorithm's sensitivity to perturbations in training data, numerous studies have used the framework of uniform stability to investigate generalization properties in gradient-based methods, encompassing both convex and non-convex settings, e.g. [18; 29; 32; 26; 14; 2; 24; 13; 12; 25; 22; 47] .\nA line of research has focused on understanding the generalization properties resulting from the incorporation of artificial noise into stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, as initiated by Keskar et al.

        "The Urban green space (UGS) availability has long been investigated, because of the importance of green spaces for the health and well-being of urban residents. Generally, there are beneficial associations between green space exposure and reduced stress, positive mood, less depressive symptoms, better emotional well-being, improved mental health and behaviour, and decreased psychological distress in adolescents [14] . Yet, there is significant differentiation, regarding the arXiv:2404.15492v1 [cs.AI] 23 Apr 2024 UGS accessibility, between Northern (above-average availability) and Southern (below-average availability) European cities [7] .\nGenerative artificial intelligence (genAI) has garnered significant attention for its transformative potential across diverse domains, including computer science, creative arts, and language processing. While its efficacy in fields like medicine and healthcare has been demonstrated, its application in engineering domains such as urban planning and architectural design remains unexplored.\nIn response to this gap, this paper explores the utilization of genAI, specifically generative design methodologies, in addressing critical challenges in intervention planning, particularly within urban environments. Generative design, characterized by advanced algorithms and computational techniques, offers a systematic approach to automating the generation of design scenarios based on predefined parameters and constraints. By extending its application to multi-scale intervention planning, including architectural design and urban revitalization, we aim to harness the potential of genAI in transforming urban landscapes.\nThe primary objective of this study is to showcase the potential of generative AI models in intervention planning applications. To this end, we introduce a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) Desktop application developed for generating images and implementing generative design in real-world scenarios.

First we note that when a numerical method is drift implicit then the nonlinearity \u00b5 can be controlled, see for example Higham et al. [2013] , Yao and Gan [2018] , but at the expense of a linear solve at each step. Higham et al. Higham et al. [2002] investigated the strong convergence of explicit Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme under non-globally Lipschitz coefficients and concluded that if the numerical solution has bounded moments then strong convergence can be obtained. However, Hutzenthaler et al. Hutzenthaler et al. [2011] proved that the explicit EM scheme produces numerical solution with unbounded moments for superlinearly growing coefficients \u00b5 and \u03c3. Additionally in Hutzenthaler et al. [2012] they proposed an explicit scheme, \"tamed EM\", based on replacing a superlinearly growing coefficient with its first order bounded approximation at each step in the scheme.",
        "D Ata visualization has been broadly applied to communicate data and information in an effective and expressive manner. Recently, an emerging trend has been to combine narrative and storytelling with visualization [1] . The norms of communicative and exploratory information visualization are used in narrative visualizations in order to tell the desired story [2] . However, creating visualizations with narrative information is a challenging and time-consuming task. Such a creation usually requires data analytic skills and visualization design expertise. Even experts need to spend much time and effort creating an ideal visualization for a specific design scenario. Therefore, by summarizing the experience in practice, researchers specify various design spaces and visualization scenarios for distinct narrative genres, which are used to guide users to create narrative visualizations.\nWith the emergence of new user requirements and the advancement of automation technology, an increasing number of intelligent tools have been created to assist the visual creative process. Authoring tools offer rich interactions that allow users to adequately control the creation process. However, such tools still require users to decide on each visualization element manually. To further weaken the barriers and reduce the burdens of creation, researchers have developed ML/AI-supported tools and ML/AIgenerator tools to support a more automatic process. ML/AIsupported tools usually provide recommendations as part of the narrative visualization creation process. Normally, users need to make their own design choices to achieve the design outcome. However, ML/AI-generator tools do not require user expertise in visualization and can generate a complete set of visualization designs without user intervention.\n\u2022 Qing Chen, Shixiong Cao, and Nan Cao are with Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University.

Automatic tools that support various genres of narrative visualizations have not been sufficiently investigated. However, systematic reviews on how (and to what extent) automation shapes visual design and visual narrative processes are generally lacking. The narrative process describes the primary responsibilities and actions of data visualization storytellers and the types of artifacts that come from these activities [6] . In addition, most previous studies aim at the creation process from the visual design level. Advances in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction have brought more opportunities and challenges to this field. Therefore, a state-of-the-art survey is required to provide a better understanding of automation involvement in narrative visualization creation tools.",
        "A probabilistic program augments an imperative program with primitives for randomization. Probabilistic programs allow direct implementation of randomized computation and probabilistic modeling and have found applications in machine learning, bio-informatics, epidemiology, and information retrieval amongst others; see Katoen et al. [2015] for a comprehensive presentation of their applicability.\nWe study programs written in a classical imperative language with constructs for bounded (binary) nondeterministic choice 1 [] 2 and discrete probabilistic choice 1 \u2295 2 . The first program can nondeterministically reduce to either 1 or 2 ; the second reduces to 1 with probability and to 2 with probability 1 -. which continues execution or halts with probability 1/2 each. A consequence of our result is that every probabilistic program has an effectively constructible normal form, which we call Knievel form (after Evel Knievel, who made many such choices in his life). Our second main result is a sound and complete proof rule for Knievel form PAST programs. We prove that proof systems for PAST require transfinite ordinals up to the first non-computable ordinal CK 1 , also known as the Church-Kleene ordinal. This is in contrast to AST and BAST, neither of which require transfinite ordinals. In fact, most proof systems for AST and BAST use ranking supermartingales that map program states to the reals with the proviso that each program transition decreases the expected value of the mapping by a minimum amount [Chakarov and Sankaranarayanan 2013; Fioriti and Hermanns 2015; Fu and Chatterjee 2019] . Our result shows that such an attempt will not work for PAST. To illustrate this claim, we describe in Section 2 a stochastic variant of the Hydra game [Kirby and Paris 1982 ] that shows an intuitive example of a PAST program that requires transfinite ordinals up to 0 to demonstrate termination. Recall that the complexity of valid statements in the standard model of arithmetic is \u0394 1 1 [Rogers Jr. 1987] ; thus, relative completeness results for PAST must use more powerful proof systems.\nOur PAST proof rule for Knievel form programs uses two ingredients. The first is a ranking function from program states to ordinals up to CK 1 with the property that only terminal states are ranked zero. The second is a state-dependent certificate, based on ranking supermartingales, for a bound on the expected time to reach a state with a lower rank independent of the scheduler.\nWe show that for every program-not necessarily in Knievel form-the proof rule is complete: from every PAST program, one can extract a rank and a certificate. Moreover, by analyzing the possible traces of programs in Knievel form, we show that the rule is sound: the existence of such a ranking function and a ranking supermartingale implies that the expected running time is bounded for each scheduler. However, soundness depends on the normal form: the rule is not sound if applied to general programs. Since our first result provides an effective transformation to Knievel form, we nevertheless get a semantically sound and complete proof system by first transforming the program into the normal form and then applying the proof rule.\nWe also show that ordinals up to CK 1 are necessary by explicitly constructing, for each constructible ordinal o < CK 1 , a PAST program for which suitable ranking functions include o in their range. Our construction encodes a recursive -tree into a probabilistic program ( ) such that is well-founded iff ( ) is PAST-recall that the constructible ordinals are coded by such trees [Kozen 2006 ].\nOur results are related to termination and fair termination problems for non-probabilistic programs with unbounded countable nondeterministic choice [Apt and Plotkin 1986; Chandra 1978; Harel 1986; Harel and Kozen 1984] . The \u03a0 1 1 -completeness and the requirement of ordinals up to CK 1 for deciding termination of programs with countable nondeterministic choice was shown by Chandra [1978] and Apt and Plotkin [1986] . Additionally, Harel [1986] showed a general recursive transformation on trees with bounded nondeterministic choice and fairness that reduces fair termination to termination, thereby providing a semantically complete proof system for fair termination. Since fairness can simulate countable nondeterminism using bounded nondeterminism, these results also show a lower complexity bound and the necessity of transfinite ordinals for fair termination. Our results show that countable nondeterminism and discrete probabilistic choice has the same power.",
        "Detecting small objects in infrared (IR) images accurately is essential in various applications, including medical or security fields. Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is a great challenge in computer vision, where the difficulties are mainly raised by (i) the size of the targets (area below 20 pixels), (ii) the complex and highly textured backgrounds, leading to many false alarms, and (iii) the learning conditions, namely learning from small, little diversified and highly class-imbalanced datasets, since the number of target class pixels is very small in comparison with the background class one. The rise of deep learning methods has led to impressive advances in object detection in the past decades, mostly thanks to their ability to learn from a huge amount of annotated data to extract non-linear features well adapted to the final task. For IRSTD, semantic segmentation neural networks (NN) are the most widely used [1] . These include ACM [2] , LSPM [3] and one of the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, namely DNANet [4] , which consists of several nested UNets and a multiscale fusion module that enable the segmentation of small objects with variable sizes. However, a major issue of relying on segmentation NN for object detection is that object fragmentation can occur when tuning the threshold used to binarize the segmentation map. This can lead to many undesired false alarms and distort counting metrics. Object detection algorithms like Faster-RCNN [5] or YOLO [6] reduce this risk by explicitly localizing the objects thanks to the bounding box regression. However, they often have difficulty in detecting tiny objects. Very few studies have focused on adapting such detectors for IRSTD [7] , and no rigorous comparison was made with SOTA IRSTD methods.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel YOLO detection head, called OL-NFA (for Object-Level Number of False Alarms), that is specifically designed for small object detection. This module integrates an a contrario decision criterion that guides the feature extraction so that unexpected objects stand out against the background and are detected. It is used to re-estimate the objectness scores computed by a YOLO backbone, and has been carefully implemented to allow the back-propagation during training.",
        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 2000) is a strongly-lexicalized grammar formalism in which rich syntactic categories at the lexical level impose tight constraints on the constituents that can be formed. Its syntax-semantics interface has been attractive for downstream tasks such as semantic parsing (Artzi et al., 2015) and machine translation (N\u01cedejde et al., 2017) .\nMost CCG parsers operate as a pipeline whose first task is 'supertagging', i.e., sequence labeling with a large search space of complex 'supertags' (Clark and Curran, 2004; Xu et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2016, inter alia) . The complex categories specify valency information: expected arguments to the right are signaled with forward slashes, and expected arguments to the left with backward slashes. For example, transitive verbs in English (like \"saw\" in Figure 1a ) are tagged (S/NP)/NP to indicate that they expect a subsequent object noun phrase (NP) and a preceding subject NP to form a clause (S). Given the supertags, all that remains to parsing is applying general rules of (binary) combination between adjacent constituents until the entire input is covered. Supertagging thus represents the crux of the overall parsing process. In contrast to the simpler task of part-of-speech tagging, supertaggers are required to resolve most of the syntactic ambiguity in the input.\nOne key challenge of CCG supertagging is that the tagset is large and open-ended to account for combinatorial possibilities of syntactic constructions. This results in a heavy-tailed distribution of supertags, which is visualized in Figure 1b ; a large proportion of unique supertags are rare or unseen (out-of-vocabulary, OOV) even in a training set as large as the Penn Treebank's. Previous CCG supertaggers have surrendered in the face of this challenge: they treat categories as a fixed set of opaque labels, rather than modeling their compositional structure.",
        "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [17] are expressive models that can distill structural knowledge into highly representative embeddings. While graphs are the representation of choice in domains such as social networks [3, 31] , knowledge graphs for recommendation systems [6] , in this work we focus on molecular graphs that are the core of drug discovery, molecular property prediction [13, 23] and virtual screening [56, 64] . Molecular graphs differ from their more well known counterparts such as social network graphs. First, each molecule is a graph representation of the basic atoms and bonds that constitute the molecule and hence the size of the graph is small. Second, even though each graph may be small there are numerous molecules that are being developed continuously for varied use cases. Hence, what they lack in size they make up for it in structural heterogeneity. Third, molecules can be labeled along multiple orthogonal dimensions. Since each graph has multiple labels the learning itself can be characterized as multi-task learning. For instance, whether a molecule has potentially harmful interaction with a diabetics drug, or whether that molecule can turn toxic under certain conditions are distinct labels. Molecular property analysis and labeling requires wet-lab experiments, which is time-consuming and resource-costly. As a consequence, many entities may only have partially labeled molecules even if they know the graph structure. Finally, molecules are coveted inventions and hence entities often possess proprietary graph representation that cannot be shared with other institutions for competitive and regulatory reasons. But training collectively over a private set of molecular graphs can have immense societal benefits such as accelerated drug discovery.\nFederated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that addresses this data isolation problem via collaborative training. In this paradigm, training is an act of collaboration between multiple clients (such as research institutions) without requiring centralized local data while providing a certain degree of user-level privacy [42, 26] . However there are still challenges and shortcomings to training GNNs in a federated setting. As shown in [20] , federated GNNs perform poorly in a non-iid setting. This setting (Figure 1 ) is the typical case in molecular graphs since each owner may have different molecules and even when they have the same molecular graph each owner may have an incomplete set of labels for each molecule. The left half of Figure 1 shows a simpler case where all the clients can communicate through a central server. But in practice the presence of a central server is not feasible when multiple competing entities may want to collaboratively learn. The challenges are further compounded by the lack of a central server as shown in the right half of the Figure 1 .",
        "Having models learn language from text alone has been criticised based on several aspects, from fundamental arguments about how language works (Bender and Koller, 2020) to findings on lack of certain information in text (Gordon and Van Durme, 2013; Paik et al., 2021) . To train language models on more sources than text is therefore a proposed direction for creating language models with better language understanding (Bisk et al., 2020) . These models would then become multimodal, with the capability to process both text and information from other modalities.\nThe multimodal models of interest in this work are vision-and-language (VL) models that have been trained on images and their corresponding captions or visual questions (Lu et al., 2019; Tan and Bansal, 2019; Su et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020) . These models are performant on several image-text tasks such as image captioning and VQA, while there also is an increased interest for evaluating how their natural language understanding is influenced by their multimodal training (Iki and Aizawa, 2021; Yun et al., 2021) .\nIt is however tricky to investigate the pure natural language understanding of the aforementioned VL models, since their language processing is conditioned on visual features. For certain investigations, we may simply wish to evaluate the models on textonly domains, while these models have not been developed for this purpose. If we do not attend to the issue of accurately adapting VL models to text-only domains we risk evaluating them out-of-distribution and fail to accurately measure their natural language understanding capabilities.\nDifferent methods for adapting VL models to a text-only input have already been tried and we have some results on the natural language understanding capabilities of these models (Iki and Aizawa, 2021; Yun et al., 2021) . However, no systematic search for the best way to adapt VL models to a textonly input has been performed and it is unclear how well the VL models work with the previously proposed adaptations. If we wish to continue the search for better natural language understanding in multimodal models, we should ensure that we evaluate them in the best way possible. In this work, we search for the best method for adapting existing VL models to a text-only input, as illustrated in Figure 1 . 1With the adaptations in place, we can then compare the VL models to their unimodal text-only counterparts. This will complement already existing results on the natural language understanding capabilities of VL models and the effect of multimodal training.",
        "Since the advent of artificial intelligence, various applications have been developed that have assisted human productivity and alleviated human effort, resulting in efficient time management. Artificial intelligence has aided businesses, healthcare, information technology, banking, transportation, and robots. The term \"artificial intelligence\" refers to reproducing human intelligence processes using machines, specifically computer systems [1] .Artificial intelligence allows the United States of America to run more efficiently, produce cleaner products, reduce adverse environmental impacts, promote public safety, and improve human health. Until recently, conversations around \"AI ethics\" were limited to academic institutions and non-profit organizations. AI could be dangerous to humans and corporations if not employed ethically. Currently, the world's largest technology companies -Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and a few other Fortune 500 companiesare forming fast-growing teams to address the ethical issues that arise from the widespread collection, analysis, and use of massive amounts of data, particularly data used to train machine learning models, or artificial intelligence. Most businesses struggle with data and AI ethics through ad hoc talks on a per-product basis, despite the costs of Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are different from expert systems -\"collections of rules programmed by humans in the form of if-then statements--are not part of AI since they cannot learn autonomously from external data. Expert systems represent a different approach altogether since they assume that human intelligence can be formalized through rules and hence reconstructed in a top-down approach (also called symbolic or knowledge-based approach)\" [4] . Expert systems perform poorly in comparison to AI systems in tasks such as vision, sound, and language understanding.",
        "Despite the remarkable successes of deep learning and artificial intelligence across various technological domains, achieving a high-performing system does not automatically guarantee its practical deployment and use, particularly in the field of medicine. Given the profound implications of medical decisions on human lives, doctors and patients often approach AI diagnoses with skepticism, notwithstanding claims of high precision, due to concerns surrounding trustworthiness.\nIn this study, we delve into the concept of trustworthy medical AI, focusing on two essential aspects. Firstly, explainability is crucial; without a clear explanation of the rationale behind a diagnosis, patients would be much less receptive to AI-driven decisions. Secondly, reliability is paramount, ensuring that AI models make predictions based on pertaining patterns rather than exhibiting what is known as \"Clever-Hans behavior.\" This phenomenon occurs when a machine learning model seemingly performs well but makes decisions based on irrelevant factors such as biases or coincidental correlations in data.\nThese two aspects are interrelated: a thorough model explanation not only provides the foundation for decision-making but also reveals whether predictions are influenced by Clever-Hans behavior. By addressing both explainability and reliability, we aim to enhance trust in medical AI systems and pave the way for their responsible and effective integration into healthcare practices.\nA wide variety of explainable AI (XAI) tools have arisen to explain the predictions of trained black-box models, referred to as post-hoc methods. Although these methods have shown some promising prospects, they are vulnerable to the risk of generating unjustified counterfactual examples [12] , hence may not be reliable. It is worth noting the nuances between explainability and interpretability in this context, although they are often loosely used interchangeably. Explainability refers to the ability to explain model decisions after training (post-hoc), while the original model is not interpretable by itself. On the other hand, interpretability is an inherent property of a model and means how easily and intuitively one can understand and make sense of the model's decision-making process. Examples of highly interpretable models include decision trees and linear regression, which provide easily traceable logic for what roles the features played in decision-making. However, such models are shallow models and typically under-perform deep neural networks (DNNs). As post-hoc explanation is often inadequate to unravel the full complexity of model behavior due to its after-training nature, we focus on designing interpretable models in this paper, taking a during-modeling approach.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach that guides the decision-making process of neural networks during the training phase by not only directing the model toward correct predictions but also penalizing any (including correct) predictions based on wrong cues. Cues refer to patterns, relationships, or features within the input data that are deemed relevant to the task at hand by the model to make predictions or decisions. Misinterpreted or misidentified cues erode the trustworthiness and reliability of a model even if its predictions are correct since the performance would not generalize to future unseen data.",
        "Existing computing systems process increasingly large amounts of data. Data is key for many modern (and likely even more future) workloads and systems. Important workloads (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, genome analysis, graph analytics, databases, video analytics), whether they execute on cloud servers or mobile systems are all data intensive; they require efficient processing of large amounts of data. Today, we can generate more data than we can process, as exemplified by the rapid increase in the data obtained in astronomy observations and genome sequencing [1] .\nUnfortunately, the way they are designed, modern computers are not efficient at dealing with large amounts of data: large amounts of application data greatly overwhelm the storage capability, the communication capability, and the computation capability of the modern machines we design today. As such, data becomes a large performance and energy bottleneck, and it greatly impacts system robustness and security as well. As a prime example, we provide evidence that the potential for new genome sequencing technologies, such as nanopore sequencing [2] , is greatly limited by how fast and how efficiently we can process the huge amounts of genomic data the underlying technology can provide us with [3, 83] .\nThe processor-centric design paradigm (and the ensuing processor-centric execution model) of modern computing systems is one prime cause of why data overwhelms modern machines [4, 5] . With this paradigm, there is a dichotomy between processing and memory/storage: data has to be brought from storage and memory units to compute units, which are far away from the memory/storage units. The dichotomy exists at the macro-scale (across the internet) and the micro-scale (within a single compute node). This processormemory dichotomy leads to large amounts of data movement across the entire system, degrading performance and expending large amounts of energy.",
        "Over the past few years, lightweight cryptography has been largely in demand. Many lightweight block ciphers have been proposed for the highly constrained devices such as RFID tags, sensors in wireless network, small internet-enabled applications with low computing power and implementation area. Improving the encryption efficiency while at the same time protecting the system has become a major challenge in this area and sparked research efforts. Recently, many encryption ciphers have been developed targeting this problem. SIMON [1] , PRINCE [2] , TWINE [3] are only a few of the light-weight block ciphers.\nLED [4] is a lightweight block cipher proposed by Guo et al. at CHES 2011 which, among block ciphers with comparable parameters [5] , achieves the smallest area footprint through its compact hardware implementation.\nAlthough modern block cipher algorithms such as LED are secure against cryptanalysis, the implementation of an algorithm can still leak information about sensitive parameters, making them susceptible to Side Channel Attacks (SCA). 1 https://github.com/Secure-Embedded-Systems/Open-Source-Threshold-Implementation-of-LED-Block-Cipher/ SCAs break cryptosystems by obtaining information leaked from power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, or execution delay. One of the popular SCA schemes is Differential Power Analysis (DPA) [6] which combines information across many power measurements with different known inputs. A widely implemented countermeasure to SCA is masking [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] . However, it has been proven [11] , [12] that hardware implementations with masking can still be vulnerable to DPA because of glitches and require fresh random values after every nonlinear operation.\nTo deal with this issue, Nikova et al. proposed a new masking scheme, Threshold Implementation (TI) [13] . TI is a secret sharing-based countermeasure and is provably secure against first-order SCA attack even in the presence of glitches. Moreover, TI is immune to mean power consumption comparison based higher-order attacks.",
        "The scope and scale of academic research pursued within the United States today is not possible without federal funding. The National Science Foundation's annual Higher Education Research and Development Survey reported total higher education R&D expenditures of $86.4 billion for federal fiscal year 2020 with more than 46 of those expended billions originating with the federal government [1] . Focusing more specifically on academic biomedical research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone awarded research grants in excess of $29 billion during the same fiscal year [2] . It is not surprising then that when the first major study documenting racial disparity in research funding was published in 2011, the authors focused on the NIH [3] . Since this original study, others have added to the national discussion using NIH proposal data [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .\nThe NIH is the largest and most influential funder of academic biomedical research within the United States. NIH research awards, particularly R01 and equivalent funding mechanisms, play an important role in promotion and tenure decisions as well as in the stability of research programs. The size and duration of these awards allow researchers to spend more of their effort on research and less on grant-writing. Academic institutions particularly value NIH award funding as it generally comes with higher indirect cost rates than non-federal funding and is used in external rankings of Medical School research programs. For instance, when evaluating Medical Schools for their \"Best Medical Schools for Research\" rankings, US News & World Reports assigns a weight of 0.4 out of 1.0 to \"Research Activity\". This metric is based solely on federal funding [9] , the large majority of which comprises NIH grants. While US News & World Reports began publishing a campus ethnic diversity index in 2020 [10] it is not incorporated into the \"Best Medical Schools for Research\" calculation and does not currently influence these rankings. As Ginther has shown [3, 4] and researchers within the NIH have recently acknowledged and expanded upon [5, 6] , there remains a significant gap between NIH funding rates of white principal investigators (PIs) and Black/African American (B/AA) PIs. As such, there is an inherent tension between medical school rankings and faculty diversity.\nThe need for increased diversity in academic medicine and the biomedical workforce has been well substantiated. While many academic institutions advocate for increased equity among faculty sub-demographics, there remains a dearth of quantitative information supporting specific interventions. Understandably, academic administrators and faculty leaders are hesitant to implement reforms that could unintentionally compound existing inequities or even create new systemic problems. The issues are considered too important to get wrong. This sense of policy paralysis, in turn, can lead institutions into a cycle of calls for action followed by a series of educational events that, while important, are insufficient on their own to effect policy change.\nOne practical step forward is for academic administrators to utilize the proposal databases that have already been created at their institutions to understand and evaluate diversity in academic research. Given the importance of extramural grant funding to academic research and the subsequent emphasis placed upon grant funding in everything from individual faculty promotion and tenure review to departmental evaluation, it is reasonable to begin any study of potential research inequity with an analysis of research grant proposal submissions and awards.",
        "Virtual design, online marketplaces, product lifecycle workflows, AR/VR, videogames, . . . , all require lifelike digital representations of real-world materials (i.e., digital twins). Acquiring these digital copies is typically a cumbersome and slow process that requires expensive machines and several manual steps, creating roadblocks for scalability, repeatability, and consistency. Among the many industries requiring digital twins of materials, the fashion industry is in a critical position; facing the demand to digitize hundreds of samples of textiles in short periods, which cannot be achieved with the current technology. Our method digitizes a material taking as input a single scanned image. Further, it returns a pixel-wise metric of uncertainty \u03c3BRDF, computed at test time through probabilistic sampling, proven useful for active learning. In the plot we compare the average deviations of the radiance of different renders in the blue crop w.r.t the ground truth (GT) of: 1) the distribution of the probabilistic samples of a model trained with 100% of the data; 2) the deterministic output of that model; 3) the output of a model trained using 40% of the training dataset, sampled by active learning guided by \u03c3BRDF and; 4) a model trained using 40% of the training dataset, randomly sampled. The material at the bottom, for which the model shows a higher uncertainty, generates more varied renders and differs most from the ground truth.\nIn this context, casual capture systems for optical digitization provide a promising path for scalability. These systems leverage handheld devices (such as smartphones), one or more different illuminations, and learning-based priors to estimate the material's diffuse and specular reflection lobes. However, existing approaches present several drawbacks that make them unsuitable for practical digitization workflows. Generative solutions [18, 63] typically produce unrealistic artifacts. Despite recent attempts to improve tileability and controllability [73] , these solutions are slow to train and to evaluate (requiring online optimization iterations), are limited in resolution, and present challenges for generalization (requiring one model per material class). Further, the fact that these methods build on perceptual losses -not pixel losses-to compare the input photo with the generated material entails extra difficulties when it comes to guaranteeing the repeatability and consistency required for build- ing a digital inventory (i.e., color swatches, prints, or other variations). On the other hand, methods that build on differentiable node graphs [21] overcome the tileability and resolution limitations, yet, they share the problems derived from using perceptual losses and category-specific training.\nScan Albedo\nIn this work, we present UMat, a practical, scalable, and reliable approach to digitizing the optical appearance of textile material samples using SVBRDFs. Commonly used SVBRDFs typically contain two reflection terms: a diffuse term, parameterized by an albedo image, and a specular one, parameterized by normals, specularity, and roughness. Prior work typically estimates both components, which becomes a very challenging problem, obtaining over-smooth outputs, and being prone to artifacts [7, 16, 74] . Instead, in this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to provide accurate digitizations of materials leveraging as input a single diffuse image that acts as albedo and estimating the specular components using a neural network. Our key observation is to realize that most of the appearance variability of textile materials is due to its microgeometry and that a commodity flatbed scanner can approximate the type of diffuse illumination that we require for the majority of textile materials (see Figure 2 ).\nNevertheless, single-image material estimation is still an ill-posed problem in our setting, as reflectance properties may not be directly observable from a single diffuse image. To account for these non-directly observable properties, we propose a novel way to measure the model's confidence about its prediction at test time. Leveraging Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout [10] , we propose an uncertainty metric computed as the variance of sampling and evaluating multiple estimations for a single input in a render space.",
        "Traditional image segmentation requires explicit target objects or pre-define categories for pixel-level classification. However, a broad spectrum of open-world applications require the segmentation system to understand and interact with more complicated human instructions, such as home robots [18] , self-driving [8] , and augmented reality [15] .\nIn recent years, the development of vision-language pretrained models like CLIP [28] , has shifted image segmentation from close-set segmentation, where targets must belong to a predefined set of categories, to open-vocabulary segmentation, enabling adaptation to unseen categories. By unifying text and image into the same feature spaces, Figure 1 . Our LLM-Seg model integrates multiple foundation models including LLaVA [23] , Segment Anything Model [14] , and DINOv2 [27] . The Segment Anything Model and DINOv2 generate mask proposals and embeddings. LLaVA is responsible for perceiving the input image and question, and it outputs a special < SEG > token to guide the mask selection module.\nthese models significantly reduce the cost of training across new datasets, thereby broadening the applicability of image segmentation tasks. However, the scope of openvocabulary segmentation remains constrained to the vocabulary or phrase level, lacking the ability to understand long and complex text prompts.\nThe recent success of Large Language Models (LLM) [2-4, 6, 30] brings new possibilities to how the segmentation target is defined. The state-of-the-art LLM models such as ChatGPT and LLama [30] show incredible reasoning ability and can answer complex questions. To transfer the reasoning ability of LLM into image segmentation, [16] proposes Reasoning Segmentation. This new image segmentation task requires the model to segment the target based on a question asked by a human. Reasoning Segmentation is a more challenging task because it requires strong reasoning ability to find out the segmentation target, as well as its unclear granularity of the target.",
        "Many network applications deliver flows with high QoS, like the end-to-end delay constraint. With the popularity of mobile computing, multimedia applications are in a significant state of change that shifts user subscription patterns [1] , [2] . For example, Anvato [3] can make online video editing for content providers, ad insertion for advertisers, caching, and transcoding for heterogeneous user devices. These particular requirements for video flows are usually satisfied by traversing different network function middleboxes, which is called service function chain (SFC). Network Function Virtualization (NFV) [4] is an emerging new technology to deploy network functions in software, which can bring benefits. The popular stream media firm, Netflix [5] , has adopted AWS to support their service chains with NFV.\nHowever, the software-implementation of network functions through virtualization technologies on general servers may bring performance degradation, compared to the corresponding physical version on dedicated hardware [6] . The reason is that the operation of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) may be affected by surges in computing load, hardware malfunctions. This reason suggests that deploying VNFs in different VMs may suffer different delays and costs. The placement of VNFs will further influence the flow transmission cost. For any given flow, we want to embed the expected SFC with the minimum cost and satisfying the end-to-end delay constraint.\nFig. 1 (a) shows a network, in which each edge and each node has a two-tuple weight, that is, (cost, delay). The twotuple weights in edges are related to the flow transmission, while the weights in nodes concern the flow process. In this\nEQUATION\nEQUATION\nFig. 1 : (a) The original network with all links and nodes, each of which is attached a two-tuple weight, (cost,delay).

Indeed, the situation that VM can deploy multiple VNFs can be addressed by replicating the VM multiple times in the original network. Fig. 1 (b) shows three feasible embedding paths.",
        "Deep learning models are used to solve many realworld problems, and they have even surpassed humanlevel performance in many tasks. However, deep learning models generally require all the training data to be available at the beginning of the training. If this is not * The first two authors contributed equally. the case, deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting [18] , and their performance on the previously seen classes or tasks starts degrading. In contrast, human beings can continually learn new classes of data without losing the previously gained knowledge. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, deep learning models should perform lifelong/continual/incremental learning [5, 20] . Deep learning models also require all the classes to be present in the train set. When the test set contains classes not seen during training, the performance of these models degrades significantly [30, 42] . This is known as the zero-shot learning problem. The incremental learning problem becomes even more challenging when coupled with the zero-shot learning problem. In this paper, we solve for the task incremental learning problem in the zero-shot and non zero-shot setting.\nThe task incremental learning problem involves training the model on one task at a time, where each task has a set of non-overlapping classes. When a new task becomes available to the network for training, the previous task data is no longer accessible. Training on only the new task data causes the network to forget all the previous task knowledge. Therefore, the model has to prevent the forgetting of older tasks when training on new tasks. The task incremental generalized zero-shot learning problem involves training the model on one task at a time, where each task has a set of unseen classes not seen during training, which is the same as the zero-shot learning setting.",
        "Finite element methods (FEM) are extensively used to simulate real world physical phenomenon [1] , [2] . In FEM, the mathematical equations associated to the physics are reformulated with a variational formulation which is then discretized. This discretization is performed on a mesh, and the quality of the elements of the mesh impacts directly the approximated solution. Several techniques exit to ensure high quality of the approximated solution, including for instance Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) [3] , stabilized finite elements [4] , bubble elements [6] , infinite elements [7] , [8] . Since the FEM solution is obtained by solving a linear system of equations, whose size is proportional to the number of discretization points composing the mesh, this represent a significant part of the computational time. The high time cost of generating the FEM solution makes it tedious for running thousands of simulations by varying the input parameters for optimization applications and finding the best input parameter set. This is particularly true in metal forging process design.\nIn this paper, as an alternative to FEM, we explore deep learning models for metal forging process design. The motivation behind using a deep learning surrogate model is to create a hybrid approach in which FEM is only used to generate high resolution results in a reduced parametric space. Neural Networks [25] are efficient at learning patterns in data and have been widely used in various applications including image learning, speech recognition, graph learning and so on, where classical learning is difficult because of the complexity in data. The low time cost of deep learning model enable faster parameter search space exploration and can save many days' worth of time during the optimization process design. Here, we created a Graph Neural Network-based deep learning model that takes the mesh objects in the form of a graph and the input parameters as the features of this graph. The reason for considering Graph Neural Network [19] based approach relies in the property of graphs [20] which share the same permutation in-variance property between meshes and point-cloud objects. We train the model to some simulations (generated by FEM) to minimize the Mean Squared Error loss for the prediction and the actual graph for all training simulations and test the performance of the model on some test simulations.",
        "Robots are becoming more and more common in everyday life, automating tasks both for individuals and companies. As a larger diversity of robots are being designed, tools to aid and speed up the design process are becoming relevant. Designing a robot by hand is a difficult task that requires expert knowledge and is time consuming [1] . One way to speed up the process is to offload some of the design to a computer. The engineer could select from a variety of designs presented by a computer, and then adjust the design to the requirements of the robot. This paper is a study of how this variety of initial designs can be generated in the context of linkage based robots. Fig. 1 . A linkage and its path generated by the 2D linkage simulator. The yellow node is the motor, the turquoise nodes are static, and the purple nodes are movable. The green points show the path that the foot of the linkage follows. The color of the beams are arbitrary. Fig. 2 . The hexapod robot platform used for testing the evolved mechanical linkages, and the two floor textures it is tested on.\nWe believe evolutionary algorithms [2] can be a viable approach to creating initial robot designs. Evolutionary algorithms have a long history in the field of evolutionary robotics for optimising robot morphology and control [3] , [4] , [5] . A subclass of evolutionary algorithms, that are especially interesting in this context, are quality-diversity algorithms [6] . These algorithms optimise for diversity or novelty along with Fig. 3 . Decoding of a genome to a linkage. Each section of seven numbers are decoded into one node. The first section is a special section containing the x and y positions of the three static nodes relative to the motor node, and the length of the crank (the beam directly turned by the motor). The first number (type) determines whether the new node is attached by one (below 0.25 as in 4.) or two beams (above 0.25 as in 2.). If the node is attached by one beam the new beam is treated as an extension of an already existing beam.",
        "Persuasion, the process of altering someone's belief, position, or opinion on a specific matter, is pervasive in human affairs and a widely studied topic in the social sciences (Keynes, 2010; Cialdini, 2001; Crano and Prislin, 2006) . From public health campaigns (Pirkis et al., 2017; Farrelly et al., 2009; Young et al., 2018) to marketing and sales (Funkhouser and Parker, 1999; Danciu, 2014) to political propaganda (Markov\u00e1, 2008; Yu et al., 2019) , various actors develop elaborate persuasive communication strategies at a large scale, investing significant resources to make their messaging resonate with broad audiences. In recent decades, the diffusion of social media and other online platforms has expanded the potential of mass persuasion by enabling personalization or microtargeting, that is, the tailoring of messages to an individual or a group to enhance their persuasiveness (Teeny et al., 2020; Kreuter et al., 1999) . Microtargeting has proven to be effective in a variety of settings (Matz et al., 2017; Ali et al., 2021; Latimer et al., 2005) . However, it has been challenging to scale due to the cost of profiling individuals and crafting personalized messages that appeal to specific targets.\nThese obstacles might soon crumble due to the recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), machine learning models trained to mimic human language and reasoning by ingesting vast amounts of textual data. Models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) , Claude (Anthropic, 2023) , and Gemini (Gemini Team, 2023) can generate coherent and contextually relevant text with fluency and versatility and exhibit super-human or human performance in a wide range of tasks (Bubeck et al., 2023) . In the context of persuasion, experts have widely expressed concerns about the risk of LLMs being used to manipulate online conversations and pollute the information ecosystem by spreading misinformation, exacerbating political polarization, reinforcing echo chambers, and persuading individuals to adopt new beliefs (Hendrycks et al., 2023; Weidinger et al., 2022; Burtell and Woodside, 2023; Bontcheva et al., 2024) . A particularly menacing aspect of AI-driven persuasion is its possibility to easily and cheaply implement personalization, conditioning the models' generations on personal attributes and psychological profiles (Bommasani et al., 2021) . This is especially relevant since LLMs and other AI systems are capable of inferring personal attributes from publicly-available digital traces such as Facebook likes (Youyou et al., 2015; Kosinski et al., 2013) , status updates (Peters and Matz, 2023; Park et al., 2015) and messages (Schwartz et al., 2013) , Reddit and Twitter posts (Staab et al., 2024; Christian et al., 2021 ), Flickr's liked pictures (Segalin et al., 2017) , and other digital footprints including mobile sensing and credit card spending (Stachl et al., 2021) . Additionally, users find it increasingly challenging to distinguish AI-generated from human-generated content, with LLMs efficiently mimicking human writing and thus gaining credibility (Kreps et al., 2022; Clark et al., 2021; Jakesch et al., 2023; Spitale et al., 2023) .\nCurrent work has explored the potential of AI-powered persuasion by comparing texts authored by humans and LLMs, finding that modern language models can generate content perceived as at least on par and often more persuasive than human-written messages (Bai et al., 2023; Karinshak et al., 2023; Palmer and Spirling, 2023) . Other research has focused on personalization, observing consequential yet non-unanimous evidence about the impact of LLMs on microtargeting (Hackenburg and Margetts, 2023; Matz et al., 2023; Simchon et al., 2024) . However, there is still limited knowledge about the persuasive power of LLMs in direct conversations with human counterparts and how AI persuasiveness, with or without personalization, compares with human performance. We argue this scenario is consequential as commercial LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are trained for conversational use (Gertner, 2023) .",
        "Social networks are the new generation of the web sites which today have been in the focus of the users' attention. These types of sites act on the basis of online community formation and each gathers a group of internet users with particular characteristics. Social networks are known as a kind of social media that have provided the access to a new way of communication and content sharing though the internet [1] . Merriam Webster defined the cluster analysis as follows: \"a statistical classification method with quantitative comparison of several properties, for discovery of whether the people of the population belong to different groups or not\" [2] . The aim of clustering is to sort the samples (people, events and so on) into the clusters in which the members of the clusters are strongly related to each other while the relationship between the members of different clusters is weak [3] . In a social network, the internal relationships of the communities are denser and more complicated than the external relations. The communities provide the valuable data about the type of the users' relationships, the method of data transport between them and the way of the users' distributions in the social networks. In fact, the communities are regarded as the main part of these networks.\nThe community detection in the social networks has played an important role in a broad spectrum of research fields. The main goal of the community detection is that the people in the community have the most similarity with each other. Or in the other words, it can be said that the people in a community are more near to each other and the people of different communities are more far from each other. The fact of being far or near to each other is determined based on different parameters.\nIn large social networks such as facebook and tweeter, communities can be recognized as groups of users who are often interacting with each other. In the networks, we expect that the amount of the exchanged data between community members be considerably higher than the amount of the exchanged data between community members and the people out of community. The network topology itself expresses whether any two users are connected to each other or not and as a result, the two users can directly transfer messages or not. In fact, it does not provide any signs revealing whether the two users contact to each other or more.",
        "As a fundamental and pivotal task, scene text recognition (STR) aiming to read the text content from natural images has attracted great interest in computer vision [15, 31, 32, 42, 46] . By taking the text image as input and textual prediction as output, some early methods regard the text recognition as a symbol classification task [31, 19] . However, it is hard to recognize images with confused visual cues (e.g. occlusion, noise, etc.), which are beyond visual discrimination. As the scene text image contains twolevel contents: visual texture and linguistic information, inspired by the Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods [23, 5] , recent STR works have shifted their research focus to acquiring linguistic information to assist recognition [47, 46, 28, 45] . Thus, the two-step architecture of vision and language models (top left of Fig. 1 ) is popular in recent methods. Specifically, the vision model only focuses on visual texture of characters without considering the linguistic information. Then, the language model predicts the relationship between characters through the linguistic learning structure (RNN [32] , CNN [7] and Transformer [45] ).\nThough these methods achieve promising results, there are still two problems: 1) the extra huge computation cost. The computation cost of language model increases significantly with the word length getting longer (linear growth for RNN [32] / CNN [7] and quadratic growth for Transformer [45] in Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, many methods adopt a deep bi-directional reasoning architecture [38, 45, 32] to capture more robust linguistic information, which further doubles the computation burden and greatly limits their efficiency in the real application. 2) The difficulty of aggregating two independent information. It is difficult to comprehensively consider and effectively fuse the visual and linguistic information from two separate structures for accurate recognition [7, 46] .",
        "Text recognition, which involves transcribing visual information into text, is a crucial technology for bridging vision and language. It has a wide range of applications, including visual search, document digitization, and more.\nText recognition has recently gained extensive attention, and significant progress has been made. However, it remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of recognizing fine-grained categories of text, which can vary in fonts, colors, and other factors, coupled with the relative scarcity of labeled real-world data. As an alternative approach, synthetic data has been used in previous studies (e.g., [12, 20, 36, 44, 45, 60] ), and meaningful results have been obtained. Nonetheless, recognition performance is still restricted by the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data.\nEfforts have been made to reduce the need for real labeled data through pre-training, which can be broadly divided into two categories: strengthening visual representation learning with unlabeled real images, and introducing language priors with a language model. In previous studies (e.g., [32, 58] ), contrastive learning and masked image modeling technologies were employed for pre-training using a large amount of unlabeled image data to obtain better visual representations. In other studies (e.g., [12, 41] ), a pre-trained language model was used to guide recognition model learning or correct recognition model predictions. These methods have achieved promising results, thanks to their incorporation of vision or language priors. However, there are two limitations to these approaches. First, they tend to focus solely on either visual representation learning or linguistic knowledge learning, while text images inherently contain both visual and linguistic information. Neglecting either type of prior knowledge may result in loss of accuracy. Second, previous studies (e.g., [12, 41] ) introduced language priors into the recognition model with a detached language model that blocked gradient flow between the recognition and language models, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.\nIn this paper, we explore the utilization of both visual and language priors through pre-training to enhance text recognition performance. Our approach unifies vision and language pre-training within the classical encoder-decoder recognition framework.",
        "Graph-based fraud detection methods, also called graph anomaly detection methods, represent objects that should be determined to be fraud or benign as nodes and make edges between them [1] , [2] . For example, in YelpChi benchmark dataset [3] , nodes are reviews and edges are created based on three different factors: (1) whether the reviews were written by the same user, (2) whether the reviews were written in the same month, and (3) whether the reviews had the same star rating. Each of these three factors can be considered as a different relation since their semantics are distinct [4] .\nSeveral recently proposed fraud detection methods distinguish different relations in computing node representations [5] - [10] . For example, CARE-GNN [11] uses a relationaware neighbor aggregator and BWGNN [12] performs a propagation process for each relation and apply a maximum pooling. Also, FRAUDRE [13] learns the fraud-aware graph convolution model under each relation. In general, these relation-aware approaches have shown superior performance over the methods that ignore relations and consider all edges equally [14] , [15] .\nIn this paper, we propose DRAG which is a Dynamic Relation-Attentive Graph neural network (Figure 1 ), which decomposes the original graph by relations to learn a node representation per relation along with a self-transformation, resulting in multiple representations for each node. We consider the self-loop used in self-transformation as another relation. At each layer, DRAG aggregates the multiple representations for each node with different learnable attention weights for the relations. The final representation is computed by aggregating representations from different layers, where not only the last layer's representation but also intermediate layers' representations are taken into account. In all these processes, we employ a dynamic graph attention mechanism [16] to let DRAG have various distributions of attention coefficients, which can differ for each node.",
        "Humans naturally perceive various sounds and identify the origins of those sounds by using both visual sense (eyes) and auditory sense (ears) [12] . The sound source localization task aims to mimic the ability of humans to correlate auditory cues with visual information in order to identify sound-making objects. Due to this property, sound source localization is closely related to various real-world applications, including unmanned aerial vehicles [14, 30] , robotics [20, 28] , and speaker source localization [6, 31] .\nThe sound source localization task can be divided into The existing methods require prior source knowledge of the number of sound-making objects. In contrast, our method can effectively localize multiple sound-making objects without the need for prior source knowledge.\ntwo categories: (1) single sound source localization and (2) multi-sound source localization. The single sound source localization task [8, 11, 21, 22, 25, 32-36, 38, 39, 41, 44, 48] aims to find one source in a scene by utilizing crossmodal correlations [32, 40] between audio and visual cues. Various methods have been developed for the effective single sound source localization by introducing hard positive mining [8, 33] , iterative learning [21] , feature regularization [22] , negative free learning [38] , false negative aware learning [39] , momentum target encoders [25] , optical flow [11, 36] , and spatial integration [41] . However, these methods focus primarily on locating a single sound source, which can be challenging in real-world environments where multiple sounds are often mixed together.\nIn response to this challenge, several multi-sound source localization methods [16, 17, 26, 27] have been developed. The main goal of multi-sound source localization is to separate and localize individual sources from complex mixtures containing different sounds, such as self-supervised audio-visual matching [16] , coarse-to-fine manner [27] , contrastive random walker [17] , and audio-visual grouping network [26] . However, a limitation of existing methods is their reliance on prior information about the number of objects that need to be separated. As shown in Figure 1(a) , existing methods heavily rely on prior knowledge about the number of sound sources. If prior knowledge is incorrect, they are frequently failed to localize sound-making objects. Thus, they can only operate in constrained environments where prior source knowledge is available for sound source localization. Consequently, accurate localization of multisound sources becomes challenging when this prior knowledge is not available. In addition, since prior knowledge is generally not provided in real-world environments, it limits their applicability in practical scenarios.",
        "Digital steganography is one of modern areas of information security. It solves the same urgent problem as cryptography -ensuring secure transmission of information. Unlike cryptography, it does not change the information itself, making it unreadable, but ensures the creation of a covert data transmission channel by embedding messages in digital objects. In recent years, various steganography algorithms have been actively created and investigated [1, 2] .\nA significant part of steganographic algorithms deal with digital images, since they are widespread and allow transferring secret information without undue suspicion. This research also focuses on hiding information in digital images. JPEG images are considered as cover images for secret messages, since a large number of images are stored and transmitted on the network in the JPEG format.",
        "Modern machine learning algorithms can predict the label of an object based on its observed characteristics with impressive accuracy. They are often trained on historical datasets sampled from the same distribution and it is important to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. Conformal prediction is a versatile and simple method introduced in (Vovk et al., 2005; Shafer & Vovk, 2008 ) that provides a finite sample and distribution free 100(1\u03b1)% confidence region on the predicted object based on past observations. The Proceedings of the 39 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, PMLR 162, 2022. Copyright 2022 by the author(s). main idea can be subsumed as a hypothesis testing between H 0 : y n+1 = z and H 1 :\ny n+1 = z ,\nwhere z is any replacement candidate for the unknown response y n+1 .\nThe conformal prediction set will consist of the collection of candidates whose tests are not rejected. The construction of a p-value function is simple. We start by fitting a model with training set {(x 1 , y 1 ), . . . , (x n , y n ), (x n+1 , z)} and sort the prediction scores/errors for each instance in ascending order. A candidate z will be considered as conformal or typical if the rank of its score is sufficiently small compared to the others. The key assumption is that the predictive model and the joint probability distribution of the sequence {(x i , y i )} n+1 i=1 are invariant w.r.t. permutation of the data. As a consequence, the ranks of the scores are equally likely and thus follow a uniform distribution which allow to calibrate a threshold on the rank statistics leading to a valid confidence set.",
        "The development of blockchain and communication techniques motivated intensive interest in the Metaverse, which is considered a next-generation Internet paradigm [1] - [3] . Attracted by the potential of the Metaverse, many governments and companies around the world are planning and preparing for the upcoming Metaverse era; e.g., South Korea is promoting lessons based on the Metaverse, Facebook announced that it would become a Metaverse company and renamed itself as Meta, and Tencent has invested in an AR platform called \"Avakin life\" [4] - [6] .\nCurrent challenges. One of the key issues in the Metaverse is to connect the virtual world and the real world with the support of extend reality (XR), including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) [7] - [10] . Current research on the Metaverse mainly focuses on solving the problem of communication and computation for VR to provide users with immersive experience [11] , [12] . However, mobile VR services require extremely high data rate, which is not easy to achieve even under the context of 5G. Besides, VR users suffer and have to bear with the high weight of current VR devices, which is another problem to be solved.\nMobile augmented reality (MAR) is a possible alternative option for VR, and also an important component of the Metaverse [13] - [16] . Compared to VR, MAR combines reality and the virtual world rather than creating a fully virtual world, which saves communication and computational cost [17] - [19] . Besides, current AR devices have a significant advantage over VR in weight, making them more comfortable and safer as wearable devices. AR also has its unique advantage in some applications, e.g., navigation, health care, tourism, shopping and education, where the interaction with reality is required [20] - [22] .\nRelated work. Although AR requires lower data rate than VR, efficient allocation of communication resources is still necessary due to the massive number of users and devices connected to the Metaverse server. To improve the communication resource efficiency and quality of service (QoS), MEC and reinforcement learning (RL) for VR/AR service have attracted much attention [23] - [29] . Feng et al. [28] proposed a smart VR transmission mode scheme based on RL to optimize the D2D system throughput and achieve a balance between performance and resource efficiency. Chen et al. [23] introduced an RL-based energyefficient MEC framework for AR services with task offloading and resource allocation to release the burden at the terminal. A recent work [30] applies deep RL to MAR services of the metaverse over 6G wireless networks. Resolution control is also one of the solutions to improve resource efficiency [31] . Higher resolution brings better QoS at the cost of occupying more communication resources while lower resolution improves resource efficiency. Thus, finding the balance between QoS and communication resources such as power and bandwidth is of vital importance to Metaverse MAR service.",
        "Since its debut, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have been extensively used in many applications and demonstrates impressive performance (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) compared to domain-specific models (e.g., CNN in computer vision, GNN in graph modeling, RNN/LSTM in language modeling, etc). In all these scenarios, the basic Transformer block, which consists of one self-attention plus two-layer nonlinear MLP, plays a critical role. A natural question arises:\nHow the basic Transformer block leads to effective learning?\nDue to the complexity and nonlinearity of Transformer architectures, it remains a highly nontrivial open problem to find a unified mathematical framework that characterizes the learning mechanism of multi-layer transformers. Existing works mostly focus on 1-layer Transformer (Li et al., 2023a; Tarzanagh et al., 2023b) with fixed MLP (Tarzanagh et al., 2023a) layer, linear activation functions (Tian et al., 2023) , and local gradient steps at initialization (Bietti et al., 2023; Oymak et al., 2023) , etc.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel joint dynamics of self-attention plus MLP, based on Joint MLP/Attention Integral (JoMA), a first integral that combines the lower layer of the MLP and self-attention layers. Leveraging this joint dynamics, the self-attention is shown to have more fine-grained and delicate behavior: it first becomes sparse as in the linear case (Tian et al., 2023) , only attends to tokens that frequently co-occur with the query, and then becomes denser and gradually includes tokens with less frequent co-occurrence, in the case of nonlinear activation. This shows a changing inductive bias in the Transformer training: first the model focuses on most salient features, then extends to less salient ones.\nAnother natural question arises: why such a learning pattern is preferred? While for 1-layer this does not give any benefits, in multilayer Transformer setting, we show qualitatively that such a dynamics plays an important role. To demonstrate that this is the case, we assume a hierarchical tree generative model for the input tokens. In this model, starting from the upper level latent variables (in which the top-most is the class label of the input sequence), abbreviated as LV s , generates the latents LV s-1 in the lower layer, until reaching the token level (s = 0). With this model, we show that the tokens generated by the lowest latents LV 1 co-occur a lot and thus can be picked up first by the attention dynamics as \"salient features\". This leads to learning of such token combinations in hidden MLP nodes, which triggers self-attention grouping at s = 1, etc.",
        "Named entity recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task in which a computer finds and labels elements in a piece of text that fall into a set of predetermined categories, such as person names, locations, medical terminology, and organization names. This task is an integral part of information extraction from unstructured text.\nThis paper focusses on just one of those categories -person names. Specifically, I experiment with model input and training data composition to see if I can develop a model that increases true positives when extracting names from text. Although this work could benefit a variety of downstream tasks, it was developed specifically for use with Businessolver's virtual benefits agent, Sofia, in order to match extracted names with user information on file, such as names of dependents and beneficiaries. If these names are extracted successfully from a user's utterance, we can then use them to complete requests from the user, such as checking a dependent's benefits, or viewing beneficiary designations.\nA shared task by Derczynski et al., 2017 presented a curated test dataset of rare and emerging entities to evaluate NER model performance on changing language and novel entities introduced into language over time. The top performing model had an F1 score of 41.86 and the task found that models had little difficulty with common English names but a harder time with identifying names or locations from other languages. In general, the models participating in this task showed that identifying and labeling these rare or novel entities was more difficult than identifying high frequency entities, which typically make up a larger portion of test data in entity recognition tasks that are not geared toward emerging language.\nBased on these findings, and because the majority of Sofia's user base resides in the United States, a culturally diverse country, I aim to create a model that performs equally well across names from various cultural backgrounds and does not exhibit performance bias between common and rare names. I believe that using a model that incorporates character-level input could be beneficial, especially in reducing the effects of out of vocabulary names not present in the training data.\nIn terms of model architecture, there are many existing approaches to NER. Yadav and Bethard (2018) summarize the highest performing models in 4 categories; knowledge-based systems (which use lexicons and domain specific resources and therefore do not need annotated training data), un-supervised and bootstrapped systems (which use cues like capitalization, extracted patterns, locations of noun phrases, etc.), feature-engineered supervised systems (which use annotated training data and frameworks such as HMMs, CRFs, SVMs, and decision trees as well as features such as orthography, presence of certain prefixes or suffixes, location in the sentence, trigger words, etc.), and feature-inferring neural network systems (which give either words, characters, or both as input to a recurrent neural network (RNN), and use pretrained word and character embeddings.",
        "Today's scientific research applications produce volumes of data too large to be stored, transferred, and analyzed efficiently because of limited storage space and potential bottlenecks in I/O systems. Cosmological simulations [1] , [2] , for example, may generate more than 20 PB of data when simulating 1 trillion particles over hundreds of snapshots per run. Climate simulations, such as the Community Earth Simulation Model (CESM) [3] , may produce hundreds of terabytes of data [4] for each run.\nEffective data compression methods have been studied extensively. Since the major scientific floating-point datasets are composed of floating-point values, however, lossless compressors [5] - [7] cannot effectively compress such datasets because of high entropy of the mantissa bits. Therefore, error-bounded lossy compressors have been widely studied because they not only significantly reduce the data size but also prevent data distortion according to a user's specified error bound. Most existing lossy compressors consider the error bound preeminent and endeavor to improve the compression ratio and performance as much as possible subject to the error bound.\nHowever, many scientific application users have requirements for the compression ratio. These requirements are determined by multiple factors such as the capacity of the assigned storage space, I/O bandwidth, or desired I/O performance. Hence, these users desire to perform fixed-ratio lossy compression-that is, compressing data based on the required compression ratio instead of only strictly respecting user's error bound. In this case, the lossy compressor needs to adjust the error bound to respect the target user-specified compression ratio, while minimizing the data distortion. The user can also provide additional constraints regarding the data distortion (such as maximum error bound) to guarantee the validity of the results from reconstructed data. While fixedratio compression can be obtained by simply truncating the mantissa of the floating-point numbers, this approach may not respect the user's diverse error constraints. With such additional constraints, the lossy compressor should make the compression ratio approach the expected level as closely as possible, while strictly respecting the data distortion constraints.\nIn this paper, we propose a generic, efficient fixed-ratio lossy compression framework, FRaZ, that is used to determine the error settings accurately for various error-controlled lossy compressors, given the particular target compression ratio with a specific scientific floating-point dataset. Our design involves two critical optimization strategies. First, we develop a global optimum searching method by leveraging Davis King's global minimum finding algorithm [8] to determine the most appropriate error setting based on the given compression ratio and dataset in parallel.",
        "Commercial and civil unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) applications are projected to have significant growth in the global market. According to SESAR, the European drone market will exceed C10 billion annually by 2035, and over C15 billion annually by 2050 [SESAR JU, 2016] . Furthermore, considering the characteristics of the missions and application fields, it is expected that the most market value will be in operations of small UAS (sUAS) and at the very-low-level airspace (VLL). Such a growing trend will be accompanied by an increase in traffic density and new challenges related to safety, reliability, efficiency. Therefore, the development and implementation of conflict management systems are considered a pre-condition to integrate UAS in the civil airspace. Most notably, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the USA aims to create a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system that will make it possible for many UAS to fly at low altitudes along with other airspace users [Barrado et al., 2020] . Europe is leading efforts to develop an equivalent UTM concept, referred to as U-space. It will provide a set of services (and micro-services) that would accommodate current and future traffic (mainly but not limited to) at VLL airspace [Prevot et al., 2016] . Similar approaches are followed also in China and Japan [Zhang, 2018] . Considering airspace under UTM services, UAS must be capable of avoiding static conflicts such as buildings, terrain, and no-fly zones and dynamic conflicts such as manned or unmanned aircraft. Here a pairwise conflict is defined as a violation of the en-route separation minima between two UAVs [ica] . To ensure operations free of conflict, UTM provides Conflict Detection and Resolution services, which comprise three layers of safety depending on the time-horizon (i.e.look-ahead time) [nas] : Strategic and Tactical Conflict Mitigation and Collision Avoidance (CA) [ica][nas] . In this work, we will focus on tactical CR applicable for small UAS missions. This function is typically treated in two ways: Self-separation and Collision Avoidance[nas] [Radanovic et al., 2019] . The former is a maneuver executed seconds before the loss of separation minima, characterized by a slight deviation from the initial flight plan, and aims to prevent CA activation. The latter provides a last-resort safety layer characterized by imminent and sharp escape maneuvers. Both functions above are encompassed within what is widely recognized as Detect and Avoid capability [Consiglio et al., 2016 , Johnson et al., 2017a] . Aligning with the up-to-date state-of-the-art, a loss of separation minima is referred to as loss of Well Clear (LoWC). While there is no standard definition of well clear (WC), two related functions are associated with this state: Remain Well Clear (RWC), and Collision Avoidance (CA) [Manfredi et al., 2017] . In terms of tactical CD&R, RWC is equivalent to the self-separation function. Defining and computation of RWC thresholds is an open research work but is mainly viewed as protection volume around UAS [Cook et al., 2017 , Consiglio et al., 2019 , Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2016] . This volume can be specified by spatial thresholds, temporal thresholds, or both at the same time. We follow the hockey-puck model [Weinert et al., 2018, McLain and Duffield, 2017] characterized by distance-based thresholds. In addition, the near-mid-air-collision (NMAC) represents the last safety volume. As the name suggests, a distance smaller than NMAC represents a very severe loss of well clear that could result in a collision in the worst case.",

This widely supported concept [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] is emerged in parallel with traditional cryptography techniques while informationtheoretic perspectives are promising.\nIn order to simultaneously enhance the fairness and the quality of service among all the users, the physical characteristics of the wireless channel are of an absolutely inconsistent nature, which originally comes from the channel's broadcast behavioursomething that should be essentially managed.\nThe concept of secrecy outage probability (SOP) in telecommunication still shows up an open research field in the literature.

        "The last decade has seen a progression of paradigm-shifting developments in long-standing problems in AI. These developments have allowed AI methods to be used in areas as diverse as computer vision, natural language processing, and other. Adding to this progression, concerns of the safety of such systems are also raised, as AI is integrated into safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles, tumor detection, etc. Therefore, an increasing need for suitable safety assurance approaches quickly emerges, especially given that recent reviews show that both the frequency and the severity of future AI failures will steadily increase [27] .\nOne of the facets of machine learning (ML) robustness is the estimation of the confidence affiliated with the output of a given ML model. Even though many ML and AI are equipped with inherent heuristics of uncertainty, or a probabilistic output that could be interpreted as a level of confidence. Such an output alone is not sufficient to confirm and substantiate the trustworthiness of the model, as it would be trained along with the model using the same data, making it prone to the same noise and biases.\nA safety argument for a system with ML components is expected to be tailored to a specific application and its context and comprise of a diverse range of measures and assumptions [8] . Some of these requirements include developmenttime approaches and runtime approaches. SafeML, proposed in [3] and improved in [2, 8] , is an approach that can address the safety of machine learning models at runtime by ensuring they work in the intended context. This is achieved by comparing training and operational data of the machine learning model in question and determining whether they are statistically too dissimilar to yield a trustworthy answer.",
        "Food image classification is crucial for advancing food pattern tracking, nutritional and health analysis, and dietary monitoring. Despite the high accuracy of current food clas- \u2020 Corresponding author sification models on static datasets with fixed classes, they falter when faced with the dynamic and evolving nature of food habits, underscored by the frequent emergence of new food categories influenced by changing dietary styles and preferences. This dynamic necessitates that food image classification models are capable of adapting to and learning from continuously changing data. In response to this challenge, our work champions the adoption of continual learning. Continual learning is meticulously designed to incrementally process and learn from data streams, facilitating seamless adaptation. However, a major obstacle encountered within continual learning frameworks is catastrophic forgetting [6] , which occurs when models lose previously learned information upon assimilating new data. This phenomenon can significantly degrade the performance of models. Our research focuses on addressing this critical challenge, aiming to enhance the robustness and adaptability of food image classification models in the face of ever-evolving data with the help of compression. This approach holds promising potential for deployment in ondevice learning applications, such as food recognition mobile apps, which typically operate within environments under constrained memory and computation resources.\nIn this work, we mainly focus on class-incremental learning (CIL), which is a more challenging but realistic setting among different continual learning setups [50] . In CIL, a model is trained on a sequence of tasks, with each task introducing new classes that were not present in previous tasks. During the inference phase, the model is expected to perform classification on all classes seen so far. Memory replay is one of the most effective methods in mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue in class-incremental learning [9, 15, 20, 24, 25, 35] . It assumes that there is a pre-defined memory budget that allows for storing selected exemplars from previously seen classes. This ensures that the training of incremental learning models incorporates not just new incoming data but also a small set of old samples, commonly referred to as the exemplar set or memory buffer. The objective of this work is to design a continual food recognition system by extending memory replay-based approaches in CIL as shown in Figure 1 .\nFigure 1 . Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) for Food Image Classification with Memory Replay. CIL models progressively learn new food categories presented in a sequential manner.A compact memory buffer retains a subset of previously encountered data, leading to a training dataset that evolves and potentially becomes imbalanced with each incremental training phase.",
        "Acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) point cloud is no longer difficult due to advances in 3D measurement technology, such as passive stereo vision [1, 2, 3, 4] , phase shifting method [5] , gray code [6] , and other methods [7, 8] . As a consequence, efficient and effective processing of 3D point cloud has become a new challenging problem. Segmentation of 3D point cloud is usually required as a pre-processing step in real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles [9] , human-robot interaction [10, 11, 12] , robotic bin-picking [13, 14, 15, 16] , pose estimation [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] , visual servoing [22, 23] , and various types of 3D point cloud processing [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] . In the field of robotics, bin-picking scenes have received a wide range of attention in the past decade. In this scene, many objects of the same category are stacked together. The difficulty of bin-picking scenes in logistics warehouses is that there are too many categories and unknown objects [29, 30, 31] , while the problem of industrial bin-picking scenes is that it is difficult to distinguish the same objects and make datasets. At present, an application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to instance segmentation of 3D point cloud is still far behind its practical use. The technical key points can be summarized as follows: 1) convolution kernels are more suitable for handling structured information, while raw 3D point cloud is unstructured and unordered; 2) the availability of high-quality, large-scale image datasets [32, 33, 34] has driven the application of deep learning to 2D images, but there are fewer 3D point cloud datasets; and 3) instance segmentation on 3D point cloud based on CNNs is timeconsuming.\nFor key point 1), PointNet [35] has been proposed as the first framework which is suitable for processing unstructured and unordered 3D point clouds. PointNet does not transform 3D point cloud data to 3D voxel grids such as [36, 37] , but uses multi-layer perceptions (MLPs) to learn the features of each point and has adopted max-pooling to obtain global information. The pioneering work of PointNet has prompted further research, and several researchers have introduced the structure of PointNet as the backbone of their network [38, 39, 40] . It is known that PointNet processes each point independently and it results in learning less local information [38, 41] . To enable learning of the 3D point cloud's local information, the methods proposed in [42, 43, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48] have increased the network's ability to perceive local information by exploring adjacent points. Following our previous work [49] , we employ DGCNN [41] as our feature extractor because DGCNN is flexible and robust to process point clouds with only coordinates.\nFor key point 2), some well-known 3D point cloud datasets include indoor scene datasets such as S3DIS [50] and SceneNN [51] , driving scenario datasets such as KITTI dataset [52] and Apollo-SouthBay dataset [53] , and single object recognition dataset likes ShapeNet dataset [37] . For robotic bin-picking, it is a huge and hard work to provide a general training dataset of various industrial objects and there is no such dataset currently. Synthesizing training data through simulation provides a feasible way to alleviate the lack of training dataset [54, 55, 49, 56, 57, 58] . At this stage, we argue that training the network with synthetic data is an economical and feasible strategy. Our network is trained by synthetic dataset and shows acceptable results on real data.\nFor key point 3), the reasons why instance segmentation on 3D point cloud by CNNs is time-consuming are described as follows. Instance segmentation locates different instances, even if they are of the same class. As instances in the scene are disordered and their number is unpredictable, it is impossible to represent instance labels with a fixed tensor. Therefore, the study of instance segmentation includes two methods: the proposal-based method requiring an object detection module and the proposal-free method without an object detection module. Proposal-based methods require complex post-processing steps to deal with many proposal regions and have poor performance in the presence of strong occlusion. For the instance segmentation of 3D point cloud, most researchers adopt the proposal-free method [39, 40, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63] . The proposal-free method usually performs semantic segmentation at first and then distinguishing different instances via clustering or metric learning [39, 40, 59, 49] . The current clustering methods first generates multiple candidate groups and then merge them, which is a very timeconsuming process.",
        "Age and gender prediction has become one of the more recognized fields in deep learning, due to the increased rate of image uploads on the internet in today's data driven world. Humans are inherently good at determining one's gender, recognizing each other and making judgements about ethnicity but age estimation still remains a formidable problem. To emphasize more on the difficulty of the problem, consider this -the most common metric used for evaluating age prediction of a person is mean absolute error (MAE). A study reported that humans can predict the age of a person above 15 years of age with a MAE of 7.2-7.4 depending on the database conditions [1] . This means that on average, humans make predictions off by 7.2-7.4 years. The question is, can we do better? Can we automate this problem in a bid to reduce human dependency and to simultaneously obtain better results? One must acknowledge that aging of face is not only determined by genetic factors but it is also influenced by lifestyle, expression, and environment [1] . Different people of similar age can look very different due to these reasons. That is why predicting age is such a challenging task inherently. The non-linear relationship between facial images and age/gender coupled with the huge paucity of large and balanced datasets with correct labels further contribute to this problem. Very few such datasets exist, majority datasets available for the task are highly imbalanced with a huge chunk of people lying in the age group of 20 to 75 [3] - [5] or are biased towards one of the genders. Use of such biased datasets is not prudent as it would create a distribution mismatch when deployed for testing on real-time images, thereby giving poor results.\nThis field of study has a huge amount of underlying potential.",
        "Dislocations -which are line defects in the crystal lattice -define the plastic deformation of metals under most conditions. Thus, discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD), which simulates the motion and interaction of an ensemble of dislocation lines, has become a very valuable computational tool for the study of metal plasticity at the mesoscale. In DDD, dislocation lines are discretized into a series of segments connecting dislocation nodes, whose positions are evolved in time by integration of nodal velocities [1] . Nodes motion results from the response of dislocations to the nodal driving force, which is a function of the local stress acting along the dislocation lines. Since all dislocation lines elastically interact with each other, the calculation of nodal forces as required to time-integrate the system is typically the most expensive stage of the simulations. The computational burden is further increased by the fact that time-integration in DDD simulations is made difficult by the intrinsic stiffness and highly non-linear behavior of the system, arising from the nature of dislocation interactions. As a result, the timestep sizes used by traditional time-integrators are typically small, limiting the physical time-scale of the approach. Thus, despite various recent progress and algorithmic advances [2] , the computational cost of DDD simulations still remains a challenge that limits the range of applicability of the method.\nHere we present a new DDD-GNN framework in which the computationally intensive timeintegration procedure is fully replaced by a graph neural network (GNN) model trained to predict nodal displacements directly from the nodal configurations and applied loading. The use of GNN appears particularly well suited for the task since dislocation line configurations are inherently a graph object. Our model additionally takes advantage of the partitioning between short and long range elastic interactions commonly used in DDD. By entirely bypassing explicit short-range forces calculation, our proposed framework has the potential to significantly accelerate the simulations. Thus, the approach developed in this work differs from previous studies that applied machinelearning techniques to DDD, e.g. to accelerate the computation of individual interaction forces [3] , characterize dislocation microstructures [4] , or learn and predict crystal plasticity by focusing on the stress/strain curves [5] [6] [7] .\nWe demonstrate our approach by considering the fundamental case of a dislocation line gliding through an array of obstacles under the action of an imposed loading.",
        "Modularity is a guiding principle behind the design of numerous autonomous platforms. For example, the autonomy stack of a typical robot consists of separate modules for perception, planning, and control [24] . In spite of the requirement of safely executing tasks in real time with limited on board computational resources, such modules usually operate at different frequencies and levels of abstraction. Roughly speaking, higher levels of abstraction allow for faster decision making. However, if the degree of abstraction varies among the different modules beyond a suitable threshold, the system as a whole can behave in unexpected, unsafe ways. By and large, choosing the right level of abstraction in robotics applications has remained somewhat of an art. We focus on developing a quantitative method of bridging the potential mismatch between the trajectory planning and control modules in a data-driven manner.\nAlthough trajectory planning and control have been among the most extensively studied areas of robotics, numerous problems remain to be solved. In particular, graph-search-based path planning algorithms can find it challenging to account for complex nonlinear system dynamics. Similarly, real-time optimization-based methods for generating trajectories typically use a simplified or a reduced order dynamics model of the agent. In contrast, low-level feedback control policies often rely on more accurate, detailed dynamics of the system being controlled in order to track a reference trajectory planned by some of the aforementioned approaches. While intuitive and conceptually appealing, this layered approach only works well if the outputs of higher layers are compatible with the abilities of lower layers.\nIn this paper, we focus on the interplay between trajectory generation and feedback control. Rather than imposing such a layered architecture on the control stack, we show that it can be derived via a suitable relaxation of a global nonlinear optimal control problem that jointly encodes both the trajectory generation and feedback control problems. Crucially, the resulting trajectory generation optimization problem is dynamics-aware, in that it is modified with a tracking penalty regularizer that encodes the dynamic feasibility of a generated trajectory. While this tracking penalty does not in general admit a closed-form expression, we show that it can be interpreted as a cost-to-go. Hence, it can be learned from system roll-outs for any feedback control policy by leveraging tools from the learning literature. Finally we evaluate our framework using unicycle and quadrotor control, and compare our approach in simulation to standard approaches to quadrotor trajectory generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our data-driven dynamics-aware framework allows for faster computation of trajectories that can be tracked accurately in both simulation and hardware. Our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We derive a layered control architecture composed of a dynamics-aware trajectory generator top layer, and a feedback control low layer. In contrast to existing work, our trajectory generation problem is naturally dynamics-aware, and includes a tracking penalty regularizer that encodes the ability of the low-layer feedback control policy to track a given reference trajectory.",
        "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful machine learning models that can learn complex patterns from data. However, their complexity can make it difficult to understand why a DNN makes a particular prediction purely from their mathematical construction. We build upon the prior Explainable AI (XAI) work from Virani et al. 1 (see Figure 1 ) which effectively explains if there is proper training data to support the decisions. However, their memory and computational footprint prevents the approach from being effective for very large data sets and on edge devices. We exploit the concept of Sparse Gaussian processes [2] [3] [4] [5] to overcome these two computational challenges while maintaining the their method's accuracy and explainability. Our approach is a computationally efficient XAI method that extracts example-based justifications and uncertainty estimates that can be applied to any pre-trained DNN.\nExplainable artificial intelligence addresses the black-box problem in many ways: it decomposes the model construction for more intuitive human understanding; it supplements models with tools that explain their decision-making; or a structured combination of the previous two. By providing insights into how AI systems make decisions, XAI can help humans to identify and correct potential errors before they cause harm. As such, XAI is a critical tool for ensuring the safety and human trust in mission-critical tasks such as jet engine maintenance and airport safety. In the context of jet engine maintenance, XAI can be used to provide detailed reasoning about the evidence suggesting potential problems before they can cause failures, recommend corrective actions to prevent potential issues, and monitor the performance of engines to ensure that they continue to operate safely. In the context of airport safety, XAI can be used to detect and explain potential hazards on the airport grounds, expedite human understanding of the evidence behind security threats, and monitor the movement of aircraft to ensure that they follow safe takeoff and landing directions.\nWhile there are a number of competing standards and meta-studies of XAI, 6 primary seminal papers explore XAI using one of three main approaches. The first approach is to use gradient-based methods to identify the input features that are most important for a particular prediction. 7 This can be done by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input features -the features with the largest gradients are the ones that have the most influence on the prediction. The second approach to explainability is to train the DNN to output text that explains its reasoning. This can be done by using a technique called attention, which allows the DNN to focus on specific input features when making a prediction.",
        "D EEP Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in a variety of pattern recognition and computer vision applications [1] , [2] . A number of recent results show that when the deep networks are trained in large-scale datasets, the features show good generalization performance over a wide range of datasets and computer vision tasks [3] , [4] . However, due to the dataset bias problem, test errors of these deep classification networks are large when the training set and test set have a significant gap in data distributions. Fine-tuning provides a straightforward way to reduce feature bias on deep networks [5] . Unfortunately, finetuning deep network parameters in a new dataset requires a significant amount of labeled data, which are not available in many scenarios. Therefore, it is necessary and important to design algorithms that can transfer discrimination features from a labeled source domain to another related but unlabeled domain.\nTo address this problem, a more practical task called unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been studied recently. UDA generally contains two different but related datasets, i.e., a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain. The source and target domains have the same category space and learning tasks. The principal task of UDA is to transfer discriminative domain knowledge to solve the learning task in target domain [6] , [7] . In particular, since the label information of target domain is agnostic, it is sometimes difficult to guarantee that the source and target domains share the same label space. In this paper, we also consider a special UDA scenario, namely Partial UDA [8] , [9] , where the target domain category is a subset of the source domain category. The diagrams of UDA and Partial UDA are shown in Figure 1 .\nPrevious UDA methods are mainly based on shallow models [7] , [10] - [12] , which are roughly divided into two categories, i.e., instance-based methods and feature-based methods. Instance-based adaptation methods [7] , [10] reweigh samples in the source domain to better represent the target domain distribution, while feature-based methods [11] , [12] attempt to learn a shared and invariant feature space. However, limited by the model's representation capacity, the performance of these methods does not exceed the deep UDA approach.\nIn recent years, with the development of deep neural networks, more deep network-based models have been proposed to deal with UDA tasks [13] - [16] . These methods follow the idea that domain discrepancy becomes smaller in the deep feature space [3] , [4] , thus domain adaptation can be better accomplished by matching the deep features of the source and target domains. Let Z and Y represent deep features and labels, respectively. To project data from different domains to a shared deep feature space, existing methods often rely on marginal distribution alignment, which reduces the discrepancy between P s (Z) and P t (Z). A common strategy is to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) [13] , [14] or introduce the adversarial training [15] , [16] . However, the marginal distribution alignment-based method ignores the conditional dependence between features and labels when aligning the feature space, which may suffer from negative transfer. In particular, in the PDA task, aligning P s (Z) and P t (Z) will cause the target domain sample is assigned to a category that does not exist in the target domain [9] . Therefore, the marginal distribution alignment-based methods cannot deal with (Partial) UDA problems well.\nAn effective strategy to address this problem is learn a conditional domain-invariant feature space by aligning the conditional distributions P s (Z|Y ) and P t (Z|Y ). Based on this motivation, some recent UDA methods reduce the difference between P s (Z|Y ) and P t (Z|Y ) by class-specific MMD [17] , [18] or conditional adversarial generation network [19] . However, class-specific MMD requires a large number of samples to estimate the MMD in each category, which makes it difficult to apply to deep models. Conditional adversarial generation network may suffer mode collapse and training instability. In addition, the conditional distribution alignment needs to use the label information of target domain, thus it is necessary to extract the discrimination information in target domain to improve the accuracy of the pseudo-labels. Some methods introduce an extra entropy regularization to extract discriminant information in the target domain [14] , [20] . However, the entropy regularization ignores the overall discriminant information, instead, only considers the discriminant information of a single sample. This manner may cause model degradation. How to effectively measure the difference between two conditional distributions and extract the discrimination information of unlabeled data in the deep model is the key to align the conditional distributions.\nIn this paper, we propose a new conditional distribution alignment-based domain adaptation method, named Deep Conditional Adaptation Network (DCAN), which can align effectively the conditional distributions by Conditional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) and extract discriminant information from the source and target domains. CMMD can directly and efficiently measure the distance between two conditional distributions. Therefore, we use CMMD to measure the conditional distributions discrepancy between the source and target domains, and then minimize the CMMD loss to learn a conditional domain-invariant feature space, where the classifier trained on the source domain can correctly classify samples in the target domain. Compared with class-specific MMD, CMMD can be effectively estimated with fewer samples, thus it can be trained in a mini-batch manner and applied to the deep model. In addition, due to the absence of real target labels, we need to use the discriminant information in target domain to estimate CMMD.",
        "Fuzzy rule based classifiers (FRCs) have been popular in real-world applications. Their popularity can be attributed to: 1) providing good classification performance, 2) providing facility to leverage existing expert knowledge and/or 3) providing a degree of explainability [1] . FRCs were first introduced and popularized as a set of fuzzy If-Then rules for classification [2] - [4] . The initial works on FRCs [2] extended the Wang and Mendel's (WM) framework [5] to fuzzy classification rules, and made major contributions on how to weigh and aggregate the fuzzy rules.\nFRCs in general suffer from a major limitation that the size of the rule space increases exponentially with the increase in the data dimensionality. Consider a dataset having n features. When each axis of the n-dimensional pattern space is partitioned into p fuzzy subsets, the total number of possible fuzzy rules is p n . Having such a large rule space not only increases the likelihood of generating more rules, but also leads to generalization issues [6] when data is insufficient. An FRC characterized by too many rules, is also susceptible to overfitting. These concerns are serious, and therefore numerous strategies have been developed over the years to address them.\nRule generation strategies for FRCs have typically been a multi-objective problem of finding optimal rule set(s), with maximization of classification accuracy and minimization of the number of rules [7] as important objectives. Keeping this in mind, FRC frameworks are tuned in a variety of ways before use. A very common approach is to have measures/methods that judge the importance of individual rules and then select the optimal rule set [4] , [8] - [14] . These include the use of genetic algorithms for rule selection [4] , [11] , [12] , use of a fuzzy similarity measure to judge the importance of rules [8] and methods which use properties of the rule generation framework to identify and remove the redundant rules [9] , [10] . The second approach is to have measures/methods to judge the importance of features and select only the useful features [7] , [15] , [16] . A third approach for reducing the number of rules and length of each rule, is to apply orthogonal transforms namely Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the rule consequent matrix [17] - [19] . In the process of rule reduction, it is common for researchers to use interpolation methods to account for the lost rules [19] , [20] . A fourth approach for having optimal rule sets, is to have methods that optimize/tune the membership functions and add weights/confidence values to individual rules [21] , [22] .\nNeuro-fuzzy inference systems form another paradigm in FRCs. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) carry major advantages, namely 1) flexibility to model complex problems and 2) ability to quickly learn the weights in the network using back-propagation based algorithms. These advantages make them an ideal tool for use in Fuzzy systems. Some neuro-fuzzy frameworks for FRC are SuPFuNIS [23] , Fu-GeNeSys [24] , CNFS [25] , and a connectionist framework to select features while learning FRC [26] , [27] . The above frameworks make different modifications in the architecture of feedforward neural networks (FFNs), such that fuzzy logic is incorporated in the system, and its related parameters are learned through the back-propagation algorithm. All of them manage to give good classification accuracies with a compact rule base.",
        "The 3GPP has adopted a new architecture, based on microservices and web principles, dubbed 5G-SBA [1] . The SBA allows the 5G network to be flexible, reusable, and customizable, as it leverages on network functions (NFs) [2] . Having such a strong proposal derives the necessity of an efficient orchestration system where Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) are expected to be a key future target for allowing a fast and reliable NFs' programmability [3] . Nonetheless, among new industry use cases targeted by the 5G, there exist scenarios that go beyond what the current device-centric mobility approaches can support. The mobility of low latency communication services, shared by a group of moving devices, e.g., autonomous vehicles that share sensor data, is a prime example of these cases. These use-cases' demands for ultralow latency can be addressed by leveraging the MEC concept [4] . By allowing the instantiation of applications nearby to the network edge, in the vicinity of users, MEC is acknowledged as one of the key pillars for meeting the demanding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of 5G [5] .\nHowever, compared to large data-centers that tolerate the hosting of standard virtualization technologies (VMs and servers), MEC nodes are characterized by lower computational resources. Furthermore, different standards development organizations are heavily pushing towards adopting microservices approaches and architectures [6] , [7] . Therefore, when compared to traditional VMs [8] based on quick deployment, startup time, fast replication, live service migration, and scaling methods, container technologies form the ideal alternative for both MEC environments and emerging concepts of micro-services.\nBoth 3GPP and ETSI proposals offered numerous benefits, particularly the reduction of the network latency. However, users nowadays are everything except motionless, which induces a serious lack of flexibility and may take users far away from the original MEC node where their service started running, to overcome this problem, a new concept, dubbed Follow Me Cloud (FMC) [9] , [10] , has been introduced. The FMC permits services' movabilities amid different MEC nodes while ensuring low latency communications to end-users, as an FMC is a single instance moving in concordance with the end-user. Moreover, the type of services running in the Data Network (DN), which was ignored by telecommunication standardization entities, is expected to be a micro-service one. Therefore, as modern services may expand over multiple MECs, which introduces new issues -the management of instances on different MECs instead of one compared to the FMC -to ensure service continuity, links between the instances forming distributed MEC applications, additionally to links related to end-users, must be taken into account. Based on these observations, and assuming that all these issues are under SFC's migration umbrella, the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 The introduction of four practical SFC migration patterns to support micro-service based applications in the DN part from the proposed combined architecture of 3GPP and ETSI; \u2022 A detailed evaluation of the proposed patterns, where different criteria will be considered to validate the new suggested type of migrations;\n\u2022 A final comparison is presented to determine the most suitable SFC migration pattern within the 5G network.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II outlines the related works. Various SFC migrations patterns with their respective design overview and the suitable implementation are presented in Section III. Section IV illustrates the experimental setup and discusses the obtained results. Finally, we conclude the paper and introduce future research challenges in Section V. II. RELATED WORK Machen et al. [11] presented a multi-layer framework for migrating active applications in the MEC, their results show reduced total migration times, the downtime was considerable with an average of 2s in case of a blank container. The increase of the downtime is due to the non-use of the iterative approach in the live migration process. The authors of [12] proposed and evaluated three different mechanisms to improve the enduser experience by using the container-based live migration, their results show the efficiency of these solutions compared to prior works.

        "Recently, semantic communication has been widely believed to be one of the core technologies for the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks because of its high communication efficiency [1] . Compared with the current research on communication which focuses on transmitting mapped bit sequences of the raw message [2] - [4] , semantic communication systems transmit compacted semantic features. Existing literature in semantic communication mainly exploits the deep learning (DL) techniques to extract the semantic features from the raw message. For instance, Han et al. [5] proposed to extract the text-related features from the speech signal as the semantic features and remove the redundant content. On the receiver's side, the semantic features can be reconstructed by a deep learning model into the original message or directly applied for downstream tasks such as image classification and speech recognition.\nAlthough many works have been proposed for semantic communication considering different aspects, few studies have taken into account the security problems [6] - [8] . Tung et al. [6] proposed to encrypt the transmitted signal in semantic communication, but the encryption algorithm incurs a large computation overhead. Security is crucial in semantic communication for two main reasons. Firstly, semantic communication is more prone to privacy leakage compared to traditional communication. In traditional communication systems, the bit sequences being transmitted contain redundant bits to ensure reliable transmission, which can be used to provide a certain level of privacy protection. However, the semantic communication systems transmit compact and more semantic-related symbols which may reveal more private information. Secondly, deeplearning-based semantic communication may be vulnerable to attacks targeting DL models. Extensive studies have been conducted on attacks on the DL model, a review of which can be referred to [9] . If the semantic features being transmitted are eavesdropped by a malicious attacker, the attacker can reconstruct the raw message by utilizing the DL-based attack techniques. The attacker can also add perturbation to the transmitted data, causing the semantic communication system to make incorrect decisions on downstream tasks. For example, Sagduyu et al. [7] proposed a multi-domain evasion attack to cause the semantic communication system to make incorrect classifications, which is achieved by introducing noises to input images or the semantic features. Du et al. [8] proposed a semantic data poisoning attack, which causes the receiver to receive irrelevant messages from the transmitter.",
        "In recent years, memory-safe languages such as Rust and Go have significantly risen in popularity and adoption, and to this date remain some of the fastest-growing languages [GitHub Team 2023] . However, for safety-critical, low-level applications, C and C++ remain the languages of choice, owing to their ability to interact with the operating system and the memory in extremely low-level ways. While C and C++ allow developers to achieve high performance, particularly in resource-contrained environments, C and C++ are also fundamentally memory-unsafe, meaning they empower developers with the ability to \"shoot themselves in the foot\" with great ease, resulting in a rich cornocupia of well-known attack vectors, and especially of memory corruption bugs [Szekeres et al. 2013] . Indeed, recent studies by Google [Chromium Project 2020] and Microsoft [MSRC Team 2019] estimate that memory-related errors, e.g., buffer overflows or dangling pointers, are the root cause of 70% of the security vulnerabilities in widely deployed software.\nSince no one in their right mind would expect the software industry to rewrite everything (and especially legacy code) in Rust, we now ask: what can be done to mitigate the impact of incorrect memory management in existing software codebases? As argued by Berger [2012] , \"the software industry is in a position similar to that of the automobile industry of the 1950s, delivering software with lots of horsepower and tailfins but no safety measures of any kind\". One particular such airbag is the memory allocator, which oftentimes is the last line of defense against incorrect memory management performed by the client program. Realizing this, modern memory allocators [Berger and Zorn 2006; GrapheneOS Development Team 2021; Leijen et al. 2019; LLVM Project 2023; Novark and Berger 2010; Silvestro et al. 2017 ] often include mitigations against common heap vulnerabilties, for instance by randomizing allocations, or separating heap metadata from the heap itself. The net effect is that attacks are harder to conduct, and as such the allocator successfully provides some degree of protection against incorrect programs.\nAlas, allocators themselves are not immune to the kind of bugs they are supposed to defend against! They are typically written in C/C++; and because they stand on the critical path of most, if not all, client programs, allocators also must fulfill numerous goals [Wilson et al. 1995] , such as: high performance; low memory consumption; maximizing concurrency; minimizing heap contention; and so on. Meeting these goals requires custom data structures and low-level pointer and bit manipulations, and typically entails bugs: even widely used and audited allocators such as glibc are not immune, and several issues were reported in recent years [glibc 2017a ,b, 2020; MSRC Team 2021; MySQL 2019; Portal 2013; Sautereau 2021; Theftguy 2020] .\nBecause allocators are so critical, they deserve, in our opinion, the highest degree of assurance; that is, allocators ought to be formally verified, in order to guarantee that no matter the input, they will always correctly and safely maintain their data structures and invariants, hence functional correctness. Formal verification has been successfully applied to a variety of application domains, such as compilers [Barthe et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2014; Leroy 2006 ], operating systems [Gu et al. 2016; Klein et al. 2018 Klein et al. , 2009]] , and cryptography [Almeida et al. 2020; Appel 2015; Erbsen et al. 2019; Polubelova et al. 2020; Protzenko et al. 2020; Ye et al. 2017] . Formal verification has also been applied to memory allocators [Appel and Naumann 2020; Gu et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2019; Mangano et al. 2016; Marti et al. 2006; Sahebolamri et al. 2018; Sammler et al. 2021; Tuch et al. 2007 ]. But to the best of our knowledge, formal verification was never applied to a real-world allocator, complete with advanced book-keeping data structures, sharded allocation pools and performance optimizations, fine-grained concurrency, defensive security mitigations, and so on; in short, there is no verified, state-of-the-art modern memory allocator.\nWe posit there are several reasons for this glaring omission from the formal verification landscape.",
        "Neural machine translation (NMT) systems can generate higher-quality translations than phrasebased MT systems, but they come at the cost of losing control over how translations are generated. Without the explicit link between the source and the target vocabulary, enforcing specific terminological translation in domain-specific settings becomes painfully difficult for NMT systems. Consider an example where we have a Chinese-English NMT system trained for the E-commerce domain, and there is no prior knowledge of the brand name \"\u7ea2 \u7c73\" in the training data, the system would translate the input term literally as \"red (\u7ea2) rice (\u7c73)\" instead of \"Redmi\". In such scenarios, machine translation users often maintain in-domain dictionaries to ensure that specific information is translated accurately and consistently.\nA line of previous work that tried to address this problem required re-training the NMT models with lexical constraints, either by a placeholder mecha-nism (Crego et al., 2016) or via code-mixed training (Song et al., 2019; Dinu et al., 2019) . However, they do not reliably guarantee the presence of the constraints at test time. Another approach focused on constrained beam search decoding (Hokamp and Liu, 2017; Post and Vilar, 2018; Hu et al., 2019) . Although the latter approach has higher control over the target constraint terms, they significantly slow down the decoding.\nDifferent from the existing line of work, we invoke lexical constraints using a non-autoregressive approach. 1 To do this, we use Levenshtein Transformer (LevT) (Gu et al., 2019) , an edit-based generation model that performs deletion and insertion operations during inference iteratively. LevT achieves substantially higher inference speed compared to beam search without affecting quality.",
        "The stochastic contextual bandit is a general framework to formalize sequential decision-making problems in which at each step the learner observes a context drawn from a fixed distribution, it plays an action, and it receives a noisy reward. The goal of the learner is to maximize the reward accumulated over n rounds, and the performance is typically measured by the regret w.r.t. playing the optimal action in each context. This paradigm has found application in a large range of domains, including recommendation systems, online advertising, and clinical trials (e.g., Bouneffouf and Rish, 2019) . Linear contextual bandit (Lattimore and Szepesv\u00e1ri, 2020) is one of the most studied instances of contextual bandit due to its efficiency and strong theoretical guarantees. In this setting, the reward for each context x and action a is assumed to be representable as the linear combination between d-dimensional features \u03c6(x, a) \u2208 R d and an unknown parameter \u03b8 \u2208 R d . In this case, we refer to \u03c6 as a realizable representation. Algorithms based on the optimism-in-the-face-of-uncertainty principle such as LinUCB (Chu et al., 2011) and OFUL (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011) , have been proved to achieve minimax regret bound O Sd \u221a n ln(nL) and problem-dependent regret O S 2 d 2 \u2206 ln 2 (nL) , where \u2206 is the minimum gap between the reward of the best and second-best action across contexts, and L and S are upper bounds to the 2 -norm of the features \u03c6 and \u03b8 , respectively.\nUnfortunately, the dimension d, and the norm upper bounds L and S, are not the only characteristics of a representation to have an effect on the regret and existing bounds may fail at capturing the impact of the context-action features on the performance of the algorithm. In fact, as illustrated in Fig. 1 , running LinUCB with different realizable representations with same parameters d and S may lead to significantly different performance. Notably, there are \"good\" representations for which LinUCB achieves constant regret, i.e., not scaling with the horizon n. Recent works identified different conditions on the representation that can be exploited to achieve constant regret for LinUCB (Hao et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) .",
        "Bushfires pose a serious threat to communities and natural flora and fauna across wide regions of Australia, as well as internationally. Simulated fires provide valuable data for first responders to assess vulnerable areas and the risk of a firefront impacting communities as well as being able to formulate response strategies for threatening fires. Simulation platforms such as Spark [Miller et al., 2015] and Phoenix [Tolhurst and Chong, 2010] use various techniques to predict how a fire front will progress through time. Underpinning such simulations are empirical rate-of-spread (ROS) calculations. These calculations determine how quickly a fire burns given a fuel source and varying environmental conditions such as temperature, slope, wind speed and wind direction [Cruz et al., 2015] .\nA single simulation instance generates one possible future fire front. To generate uncertainty estimates of a fire reaching a given location requires running ensembles of simulations under various environmental conditions. Generating large ensembles becomes computationally taxing and may be a prohibitive barrier to this type of analysis.\nEmulation using machine learning is a method that attempts to mimic a slow running and highly parameterized process model using training examples. We develop an emulator that approximates a simulated fire front and discuss how surrogate models of this type could be used more efficiently in the future to characterise a broad range of fire scenarios simulated from varying environmental setups..",
        "Search for a randomly moving target in a discrete environment is challenging because the probability for detecting the target during a look at a particular location depends on the time of the look and the allocation of earlier looks. Thus, the optimization of searcher paths through discrete time and space results in difficult nonlinear problems with integer variables. Operational constraints on the searchers related to travel speed, endurance, and deconfliction further complicate the problem. In this paper, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that accounts for these factors. Given a planning horizon, it prescribes an optimal path for each searcher that maximizes the probability of detecting a randomly moving target that might camouflage, or not, and thus is even less predictable. We present a new linearized model and extend two others to account for operational constraints and heterogenous searchers. In an effort to reduce computing times, we develop a preprocessing technique, implement a lazy-constraint scheme within an outer-approximation solution method, and construct three cutting plane algorithms. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate some of the modeling possibilities and indicate the most effective computational strategies in various settings.\nProblems of the kind modeled in this paper arise in search-and-detection operations (see [1] and [33, Chapter 7] for a discussion of tools used by the U.S Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy), in counter-drug interdiction [21, 22, 36] , and in counter-piracy operations [3] . It is also increasingly likely that planners in the near future will need algorithms for guiding large groups of autonomous systems as they carry out various search tasks, for example in underground environments [6] .\nThe literature on search problems is extensive; see the reviews [10, 23] as well as the monographs [33, 30, 31] . We assume a randomly moving target and not one that reacts or adapts to the searchers as seen, for example, in [34, 20] and [31, Chapter 7] . Thus, we broadly face the problem of optimizing a parameterized Markov decision process [9] , but can still avoid the formulation of a dynamic program and associated computational intractability as long as false positive detections are not considered. This fact is well-known and, at least, can be traced back to [29] .\nSpecialized branch-and-bound algorithms using expected number of detections in bound calculations [32, 17, 28] are effective when optimizing for a single searcher.",
        "Many real-world applications require that multiple agents cooperatively accomplish a task, including traffic signal control (Xu et al., 2021) , power dispatch (Wang et al., 2021b) , finance (Fang et al., 2023) , and robot control (Orr & Dutta, 2023) . Recently, accompanied by the maturity of deep learning techniques, multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been widely applied to such cooperative tasks, where a group of agents interacts with a common environment, each agent decides its local action, and they are trained to maximize a shared reward or the sum of individual rewards.\nThere are two main paradigms of cooperative MARL: centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) and fully decentralized learning, according to whether the information of other agents, e.g., the actions of other agents, can be obtained during the training process. In CTDE methods, each agent has access to global information during the training but only relies on its local information to make decisions during execution. A lot of CTDE methods have been proposed (Lowe et al., 2017; Sunehag et al., 2018; Rashid et al., 2018; Son et al., 2019; Iqbal & Sha, 2019; Wang et al., 2021a; Rashid et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021c; Su & Lu, 2022b; Peng et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a; b) and achieve significant performance in multi-agent benchmarks, e.g., StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (Samvelyan et al., 2019a) and Google research football (Kurach et al., 2020) . However, in some scenarios where global information is unavailable or the number of agents is dynamically changing, the centralized modules lose effectiveness, and fully decentralized learning is necessary (Zhang et al., 2021a) . In fully decentralized learning, each agent cannot obtain any information from other agents in both training and execution. Other agents have to be treated as a part of the environment but are updating their policies during the training. Thus the environment becomes non-stationary from the perspective of individual agents (Foerster et al., 2017; Jiang & Lu, 2022) , which violates the assumptions of almost all existing reinforcement learning methods and makes it challenging to derive algorithms that can converge to the optimal joint policies in the fully decentralized setting. Perhaps due to this reason, research on decentralized learning algorithms is limited. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an overview of cooperative MARL, with a focus on fully decentralized learning algorithms, hoping to assist researchers in gaining a clear understanding and generating more interest in this challenging yet meaningful research direction.",
        "V OLT/VAR control (VVC) has been successfully inte- grated into distribution management system to optimize the reactive power flow, achieving the goal of eliminating the voltage violations and reducing network losses. Conventionally, VVC is a model-based optimization method to generate a set of optimal strategies for voltage regulation devices and reactive power resources [1] .\nWith an increasing penetration of distributed generations (DG) in active distribution network (ADN), the problems of voltage violations and high network losses are becoming more severe, especially in the case of reversed active power flow [2] , [3] . Due to the fact that most DGs are inverter-based energy resources (IB-ER) and typically produce less active power than the rated capacity, it is reasonable and required for the IB-ERs to provide Volt/VAR support.\nTill now, most VVC methods are model based. This is to say, the problem of VVC has been described as a nonlinear programming problem. The majority of the existing VVC algorithms in both centralized manners or decentralized This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 51725703).\nH. Liu and W. Wu (Corresponding Author) are with the State Key Laboratory of Power Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China (email:lht18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, wuwench@tsinghua.edu.cn). manners employ various optimization techniques with realtime measurements, which rely on the accurate model of the physical system. The common centralized VVC algorithms include the well-known conic relaxation methods, interior point methods [4] , mixed integer linear programming [5] , and evolutionary algorithms [2] , [6] . Also, plenty of literatures adopted decentralized algorithms under different structures, including local control [7] , quasi real-time reactive optimization [8] , alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) [9] , [10] and accelerate ADMM based distributed control [3] . To address the uncertainty issues regarding DERs, robust optimization [11] and scenario based uncertainty optimization [12] are also proposed.\nHowever, in ADNs, the network parameters are theoretical parameters instead of onsite identified ones, which cannot reflect the real operation states and significant errors are involved [13] - [16] . The model mismatch issue hinders the application of existing model-based methods in the real world. Therefore, model-free control is an alternative and promising solution for VVC, which learns optimal actions with only measurements data and continuous exploration in the action space. Legacy model-free optimization methods were mainly applied to the wind farm control using game theory [13] , [17] , [18] or gradient-based optimization [14] . In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, which are able to work in a model-free manner, have demonstrated remarkable performance on multiple controlling tasks such as games [19] , [20] , autonomous driving [21] , [22] and continuous control [23] , [24] . Hence, DRL-based VVC algorithms have been developed and compared to traditional optimization-based methods in [25] , [26] . In these works, DRL-based VVC methods have shown notable improvement on the performance.\nHowever, the online training start-up of the agents in DRLbased VVC methods can lead to unbearable cost and high risk, since the algorithm has little knowledge of the real system. It is reasonable and desirable for the agents to implement offline training before online training and application. Since the configuration of ADNs are continually updated, historical data is not appropriated for offline training in many scenarios.",
        "The natural products chemical space is a fascinating set of hundreds of thousands of molecules that are not only remarkably interesting from a strictly chemical point of view, but also owing to the diverse and impressive set of biological properties that many of these molecules possess.\nThe importance of this chemical space is further evidenced by the significant number of such molecules are currently used as medicines in human and veterinary medicine.\nFrom a phytochemical and pharmacognostic point of view, natural molecules are grouped into different families on the grounds of their biosynthetic origin or sometimes due to their shared chemical traits.\nMany families of natural molecules are of interest to human health, not only given their role in medicine but also given their application in nutrition or cosmetics. Among such families, terpenes are a diverse set of compounds that have paved their way not only as medicines (artemisinin, taxol, among others) but also in industries as diversified as foodstuffs (carotenoids as coloring agents), flavors (menthol, limonene, pinene) and preservatives (eugenol).\nGiven the tens of thousands of terpenes known, they are frequently grouped on the grounds of their number of carbons, which in turn reflect their biosynthetic approach. Briefly, depending on the number of C5 isoprene units, terpenes can be monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20) triterpenes (C30) and so on. Some of these molecules can also be lactones or bear sugars, thus being routinely classified as terpene lactones or terpene glycosides, respectively.\nLike other classes of natural products, the fast pace at which new molecules are described makes it increasingly difficult to continue to manually curate and study the chemical descriptors of each molecule individually. To this end, data science-based approaches are needed, as they allow to organize, interpret and filter huge amounts of data and, sometimes, highlight relationships that would otherwise eclipse human attention.\nAs frequently postulated, the quality of data in data science-centered analysis is of paramount importance. Fortunately, the digitalization of information has enabled data science-based frameworks to study the natural products chemical space.\nIn this work, we employ a data science and artificial intelligence approach to the largest and most complete database of natural products to date, the COCONUT database.",
        "Large-scale pre-training for dialogue generation (Zhang et al., 2020; Freitas et al., 2020) has advanced the development of engaging and humanlike dialogue systems. Unfortunately, state-ofthe-art open-domain chatbots, such as BlenderBot (Roller et al., 2021) , EVA (Zhou et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2022) and PLATO (Bao et al., 2021b) , still often behave inconsistently with their role or identity and produce utterances that are self-contradictory or contradict the dialogue history (Shuster et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022a) . Such inconsistency or contradiction phenomena violate Grice's cooperative principle (Grice, 1975) and greatly impair the users' long-term trust (Huang et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2022) .\nDialogue contradiction detection has shown to be an effective means to improve the consistency of chatbots (Welleck et al., 2019; Nie et al., 2021) , which, however, is always a challenging task. Specifically, the contextualization nature of conversations indicates the necessity of considering and modeling contextual information. For instance, in the \"Contradiction\" example in Figure 1 , b 2 does not explicitly contradict b 1 . However, given u 1 , the actual meaning of b 1 should be \"I like dogs, cats\" and b 1 and b 2 are thus contradictory. In contrast, in the \"Non-contradiction\" example, while b 1 and b 2 seem inconsistent (\"love\" vs. \"dislike\"), b 2 actually means \"I dislike noodles\" considering the dialogue context. Hence, b 2 is compatible with b 1 and does not make a contradiction.\nDespite the above challenge, existing datasets for contradiction detection (Dziri et al., 2019 et al., 2019) usually only consider the textual entailment relationship between two isolated sentences (Dagan et al., 2005) , which is largely insufficient for dialogue contradiction detection due to the neglect of contextual information. A recent work (Nie et al., 2021) crowd-sourced a dataset named DE-CODE that contains conversations where the last utterances contradict the dialogue histories. However, DECODE lacks a wide coverage of typical contradiction categories, and most of its contradiction cases are written by human, which have gap with the real scenario where users trigger chatbots to make contradictions.\nIn this work, we propose a benchmark for Contradiction Detection in Chinese Conversations, namely CDCONV. It contains 12K multi-turn conversations with human-annotated contradiction labels ( \u00a73). Different from previous work (e.g., Nie et al. 2021 ) that only considered the contradiction to dialogue history (i.e., History Contradiction), CDCONV covers another two typical categories: Intra-sentence Contradiction and Role Confusion, which refer to that a reply contradicts itself and that a reply confuses the speaker's role, respectively.\nSince the cases of non-contradiction and contradiction in natural human-bot conversations are extremely unbalanced ( \u00a73, Nie et al. 2021) , we automatically construct the CDCONV conversations combined with elaborate manual inspection ( \u00a74.1). Specifically, we first devise a series of automatic methods to generate conversations ( \u00a74.2), which simulate the common user behaviors that trigger chatbots to make contradictions. We then conduct careful human screening and annotation for the constructed conversations to ensure the data quality ( \u00a74.3). We validate the effectiveness of the trigger methods and show that state-of-the-art Chinese open-domain chatbots (EVA and PLATO) can be easily goaded into making contradictions ( \u00a74.4).",
        "3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize specific objects within 3D scenes by using a series of textual descriptions. This has become a crucial component in a variety of burgeoning applications, such as autonomous robotics [12, 52, 57] , virtual reality [39, 54] , and metaverse [10, 32] . For illustration, given a 3D scan in Figure 1 (a) along with its description -It is the keyboard closest to the door, the goal of 3DVG is to accurately pinpoint the keyboard in the green box, while eliminating potential distractions such as tables and desks. Despite the apparent simplicity of this task for humans, it poses a significant Comparative overview of two 3DVG approaches, where (a) Supervised 3DVG involves input from 3D scans combined with text queries, guided by object-text pair annotations, (b) Zero-shot 3DVG identifies the location of target objects using programmatic representation generated by LLMs, i.e., target category, anchor category, and relation grounding, thereby highlighting its superiority in decoding spatial relations and object identifiers within a given space, e.g., the location of the keyboard (outlined in green) can be retrieved based on the distance between the keyboard and the door (outlined in blue). challenge for machines due to their inherently limited perceptual capabilities.\nTraditional supervised 3DVG approaches [18, 58, 60 ] achieve this objective by leveraging the rich annotations in public datasets, such as ScanRefer [4] and Referit3D [1] . These approaches typically define 3DVG as a matching problem, generating possible objects via 3D detectors [21, 37] , and identifying the best match by fusing the visual and textual features.",
        "Flutter is a phenomenon of dynamic instability experienced by an aircraft during flight, resulting from the interplay of aerodynamic, inertial, and elastic forces. This interaction triggers an energy exchange, which is evident in the fluctuation of the damping rate across two or more structural modes.\nFlow-induced structural motion is a significant cause for concern as it can lead to fatigue failure, and the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) part 25, 25. 629 requires that no instability is present within the flight envelope [1] .\nFlutter flight test is an expensive and dangerous endeavor. This involves some form of artificial excitation applied to the lifting surface of the airframe and the measurement of subsequent responses due to that excitation, which is followed by an assessment of the airframe's aeroelastic stability. In a flutter flight test campaign, for a particular test point, at a given Mach number and altitude, the pilot stabilizes the aircraft, then with the help of Flight Test Interface (FTI), inputs a control surface pulse separately into the aileron, elevator, and rudder. All the data, including excitation force, response acceleration, and various important flight parameters such as speed, altitude, fuel weight, and aircraft configuration are recorded electronically on-board and sent to the ground station for real-time analysis.\nFlutter analysts at the ground station monitor and ensure all responses are damped. All the maneuvers are done at this state, then the pilot takes the aircraft to a safe speed while analysts at the ground station analyze the damping characteristics from a series of accelerometer channels. After the point is cleared by the flutter telemetry crew, the pilot takes the aircraft to the next point of the test and repeats the procedure discussed above.\nData obtained from on-board accelerometers are sent to the ground station in limited quantities based on the available bandwidth. This data is analyzed to extract the damping characteristics from each test point. Unfortunately, noise contamination, turbulence, non-optimal excitation of modes, and sensor malfunction in one or more sensors complicate the system identification process, and makes it timeconsuming to identify the aeroelastic modes.\nThe primary aim of conducting flight flutter testing is to ascertain the frequencies and damping rates at each test point. Since the 1980s, the research community has made significant progress in developing new techniques to enhance the efficiency of flutter prediction [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . These articles [8] [9] [10] [11] of the most effective and well-known flutter prediction methodologies. Furthermore, [12] [13] [14] provides flutter analysis and prediction methodologies. Typically, flutter flight tests involve the application of an artificial excitation force, enabling the determination of system dynamics through input/output analysis.\nHowever, when the input signal consists of atmospheric turbulence, the detection methodologies must rely solely on output data [15, 16] .",
        "Semantic segmentation has been one of the longstanding problems in computer vision. Segmentation algorithms produce masks to classify the pixels into foreground/background classes. These algorithms are used for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from typical applications in security [33] , robotics [26] , satellite imaging [4] , medical imaging [30] , to other interesting applications such as counting number of penguins in their arctic colonies [3] . Such algorithms require a large amount of ground truth labeled data for training, which is annotated with human Fig. 1 .

To reduce the costs and accelerate the annotation process, methods to generate annotations from user inputs have been widely studied [27, 22] .\nSeveral promising methods have been proposed that rely on user-provided cues such as bounding box [8] , clicks [22, 15] , and scribbles [18] . These methods have worked to a varying degree of success on various datasets, and incorporating such cues from the users in a principled manner that works across datasets and conditions remains an open problem. One particular form of user clicks, called extreme points (EPs), have recently received significant attention owing to the study by [27] , which showed that extreme points can be annotated more quickly than other forms of user inputs such as a bounding box.\nThis study, proposes a principled approach to encoding information from extreme points and corrective clicks using a Soft Focus Generator (SFG) that produces a heat map, which is input to the model for generating a dense segmentation mask (Figure 1 ).",
        "In this paper, an analysis is made on a codeathon activity conducted by the department of ISE, B.M.S. College of Engineering (BMSCE). The activity was conducted virtual for the theoretical course Software Engineering and Object Oriented Modelling (SEO). Software Engineering course discusses the various approaches used in solving real world problems to build a software product or a service. Object Oriented Modeling emphasizes on the design and modeling of the solutions for software programmers. As an autonomous institute, BMSCE provides faculties the liberty to frame the curriculum as well as to introduce new Teaching Learning Processes (TLP) for their courses. TLP is a well-planned method of establishing the learning objectives by creating implementation plans to meet the outcomes of the course. As part of TLP, Codeathon was planned as an Alternate Assessment Tool (AAT) as per evaluation scheme. Codeathon was conducted to motivate students, and to further explore creativity of students in problem solving techniques. Students learn better when they indulge in Activity-based Learning rather than reading from textbooks. This is a practical approach, where textbooks are used minimally and learning happens through activities and problem solving. Through Activitybased Learning (ABL) and Project-based Learning (PBL), students develop the skills to analyse and art of creativity gets nurtured. PBL is a method where students learn through projects, acquire knowledge and develop skills by working together in a team. Codeathon activity has been conducted for this course for four years in succession. The activity emphasized various real world problems whose solutions can be proposed in a day.\nThe students considered for analysis were from fifth semester, a total of 180 students (3 sections of 60 students) participated in this activity. Faculties composed teams of 3 or 4 students in a group; each section had around 15 batches. On a whole, the group consisted of a top performer, two average performers and a weak performer. The main intention was to have a different group, majorly a group without friends. This group could be diverse and can have compatibility issues initially to know each other. To know the strengths and weaknesses of the teammates, it would deliberately take more time. Also the acceptability of the solutions or strategies is more difficult when compared to a self-formed team. The course teachers were interested to learn about teamheterogeneity to encourage blended learning.",
        "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard technique to diagnose brain tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM). While being able to reliably highlight areas of sufficiently high tumor cell concentration in GBMs, it can lack the capacity to visualize areas of lower tumor cell density at the tumor border and most importantly areas of diffuse tumor infiltration, a key biological property of GBM. Current radiotherapy plans try to account for the unknown infiltration by targeting a uniformly extended volume around the tumor outlines visible in MRI. While decreasing the probability of tumor recurrence, such a treatment planning has an obvious drawback of unnecessarily damaging healthy tissue, which in turn has a negative impact on the patient's life quality. Personalizing the target of radiotherapy by complementing the MRI scans with individual tumor simulation, that models a complete spatial distribution of tumor cell concentration, could preserve healthy tissue and reduce the risk for secondary malignancies and side effects [2, 3, 4, 5] .\nConventional approaches for simulation-based personalization attempt to model the tumor growth for each individual patient using differential equation solvers. The personlaization is achieved by solving the inverse problem -identifying tumor model's parameters best matching tumor signal from MRI. However, utilizing the numerical solvers for solving an inverse problem still results in extreme runtimes which obstruct transfer into clinical practice. To address this issue, highly efficient model-and data-driven approaches were developed over the recent years [6, 7, 8, 5, 4, 9, 10] . The time for solving an inverse problem using numerical model-based solvers hit one hour of compute [6, 7, 5] .",
        "Active participation and engagement of students in the classroom is a critical factor for successful learning outcomes [1, 2] . Student engagement can be measured through observable behavioral and emotional components that are predictors of cognitive engagement [3] . Behavioral engagement includes self-directed actions taken by students to gain access to the curriculum, such as studying and doing homework, hand and body movements while observing lectures as well as participating cooperatively in classroom activities [4, 5] . Emotional engagement, on the other hand, relates to how students feel about their learning experience, environment, instructors, and classmates [6, 7, 8] . This includes emotions such as excitement or happiness about learning, boredom or disinterest in the material, or frustration and struggling to understand. Lastly, cognitive engagement is the psychological investment in academic achievement and is often demonstrated by a student's ability to conceptualize, organize, and contemplate in the act of deep learning to fully understand the material [9] .\nThe purpose of measuring student engagement in the classroom is to provide the instructor with a quantitative measure, so the instructor can adjust the lecture and classroom activities to re-engage students when disengaged. As a result, disengaged students can be confidentially recognized and assisted. Identifying the engagement of each student in a classroom can be difficult, because of the inability of an instructor to focus on all students, especially in the classes, which have free seating and a large number of students. Automation of this process would improve the learning process, especially in STEM courses.\nIn this work, we focus on automatically measuring the behavioral engagement through student body movement. Students' actions can indicate if a student is on-task or off-task during the lecture. Actions, such as taking notes, typing on laptop, and raising hand are performed by an engaged student who is on-task. On the other hand, actions such as playing with mobile, eating/drinking, and checking time are usually performed by an unengaged student who is off-task. Hence, the recognition of student actions is an essential step towards the classification of student's behavioral engagement.\nAction recognition is a challenging task due to intra-and inter class variations, dynamic background, camera motion and viewpoint variations. The modalities that are used to recognize human actions are appearance, depth, optical flow, and human skeleton. From these modalities, human skeleton can describe the action as a sequence of moving skeleton joints. Since the included information in skeleton sequence is the pose, body skeleton is robust to variations in background and illuminations.\nSkeleton-based action recognition approaches can be grouped into four categories based on the used network architecture: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN), 3D-CNN, or Recurrent neural network (RNN). In GCN-based approaches [10, 11] , the sequence of human skeletons is modeled as spatiotemporal graphs in which each joint at each timestep is represented as a node and a pair of nodes are connected by edge if they are neighbor in spatial or temporal dimension. The limitations of these approaches are non-robustness to noises in pose estimation and the necessity of careful design in integrating the skeleton with other modalities. In 2D-CNN based methods [12, 13] , manually designed transformations are utilized to model the sequence of skeletons as a pseudo image. Such input limits the exploitation of the convolutional networks' locality feature, making these techniques less competitive than GCN-based techniques on widely used benchmarks. In the 3D-CNN based method [14] , the input is represented as heatmaps volume which captures the structure of skeleton joints and its dynamics over time.",
        "Quantum computers offer the promise of executing some computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. This suggests a violation of the extended Church-Turing thesis, which says that any physically realizable model of computation can be efficiently simulated by a classical Turing machine. Indeed, quantum computers were originally proposed as a means of simulating quantum mechanical systems [1] , a task considered classically hard. There has been much progress toward identifying classically difficult problems that quantum computers can solve efficiently, such as integer factorization [2] , simulating Hamiltonian dynamics [3] [4] [5] , and extracting information about solutions of high-dimensional linear systems [6] .\nA significant milestone for the field of quantum computing is the first demonstration that a quantum device can perform computational tasks that a classical device with comparable resources cannot. This milestone has been called quantum supremacy [7, 8] , quantum advantage, or a proof of quantumness [9] , and has instigated numerous theoretical proposals and experimental efforts. However, there remain formidable technological challenges to building quantum computers, requiring both theoretical and experimental progress in architecture design, fault tolerance, and control. Various proposals for quantum advantage have addressed these challenges in different ways, by making trade-offs between ease of experimental demonstration, ease of verification, security guarantees, and practical applications.\nAnalog quantum simulation [10] , i.e., using one manybody quantum system to simulate another, is a natural approach to demonstrating quantum advantage. By building quantum systems with tunable (but perhaps non-universal) Hamiltonians, one can emulate a large class of Hamiltonians that may be difficult to simulate classically. Since it directly encodes hard problems into controllable quantum systems, analog simulation arguably mitigates many of the issues faced by digital approaches [11, 12] . Furthermore, analog simulation avoids Trotter error and other sources of algorithmic error in digital quantum simulation [13, 14] . Indeed, analog simulations of systems with hundreds of qubits have already been performed [15] .\nA major challenge for both quantum simulation and more general forms of quantum computation is the difficulty of verifying the correctness of a quantum process. There have been several proposals to verify digital quantum computation [16, 17] based on the Feynman-Kitaev circuit-to-Hamiltonian mapping [18] , but such protocols are neither designed for analog quantum simulation nor practical on near-term analog quantum devices. Previous work towards verifying analog simulation has suggested approaches such as cross-platform verification [19, 20] , Hamiltonian learning [20] , and performing a Loschmidt echo [20] [21] [22] . Unlike protocols for digital verification, these approaches can be spoofed by dishonest or inaccurate quantum simulators, and therefore cannot be used to demonstrate quantum advantage in a sound, efficiently verifiable way. A step toward verified analog simulation is made in [23] , in which the verifier measures the energy of a parent Hamiltonian of the output state of analog quantum simulation. However, all these works require a significant number of samples of the simulator's state to certify it.",
        "Before representation learning started gravitating around deep representations [7] in the last decade, a line of research that sparked interest in the early 2000s was based on the so called manifold hypothesis [6] . According to it, real-world data given in their raw format (e.g., pixels of images) lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the input space. At that time, most manifold learning algorithms were based on locally linear approximations to points on the sought manifold (e.g., LLE [64] , Isomap [70] ) or on spectral methods (e.g., MDS [40] , graph Laplacian eigenmaps [5] ).\nBack to recent years, two trends are apparent: (i) the use of graph-structured data and their direct processing by machine learning algorithms [14, 38, 23, 35] , and (ii) the resurgence of the manifold hypothesis, but with a different flavor -being explicit about the assumed manifold and, perhaps, the inductive bias that it entails: hyperbolic spaces [55, 56, 29] , spherical spaces [78] , and Cartesian products of them [36, 71, 67] . While for the first two the choice can be a priori justified -e.g., complex networks are intimately related to hyperbolic geometry [44] -the last one, originally through the work of Gu et al. [36] , is motivated through the presumed flexibility coming from its varying curvature. Our work takes that hypothesis further by exploring the representation properties of several irreducible spaces1 of non-constant sectional curvature. We use, in particular, Riemannian manifolds where points are represented as specific types of matrices and which are at the sweet spot between semantic richness and tractability.\nWith no additional qualifiers, graph embedding is a vaguely specified intermediary step used as part of systems solving a wide range of graph analytics problems [57, 75, 77, 83] . What they all have in common is the representation of certain parts of a graph as points in a continuous space. As a Figure 1 : Two graphs used in our experiments: a web network from the .edu domain [32] and a road network in Minnesota [63] . The plots include the Ollivier-Ricci curvatures of edges and nodes. We refer the reader to Appendix C for details. More such visualizations are included in Appendix G. particular instance of that general task, here we embed nodes of graphs with structural information only (i.e., undirected and without node or edge labels), as the ones shown in Figure 1 , in novel curved spaces, by leveraging the closed-form expressions of the corresponding Riemannian distance between embedding points; the resulting geodesic distances enter a differentiable objective function which \"compares\" them to the ground-truth metric given through the node-to-node graph distances. We focus on the representation capabilities of the considered matrix manifolds relative to the previously studied spaces by monitoring graph reconstruction metrics. We note that preserving graph structure is essential to downstream tasks such as link prediction [73, 82] and node classification [50, 75, 74] .",
        "T HE ubiquitous connectivity provided by modern cel- lular technologies, and the success of the mobile web and application paradigms, introduced the necessity to contextualize the service provided with location information. While smartphones have supported this capability since their infancy, the complexity of the World Wide Web (which is the common back end for practically the entire landscape of mobile applications) and the growing concerns on the user privacy requirements, makes the structured gathering of such information difficult. For instance, geographic extensions of HTTP headers were proposed [1] but never approved in IETF, leaving this information only at application level either through JavaScript [2] or with OS APIs, upon user permission. Hence, user devices such as mobile phones only share precise positioning data (such as the one got by GPS devices) if they are explicitly configured to do so, and only with applications and servers that have got a specific user permission.\nStill, locating users and terminals can also be useful outside the application domain, so network operators and third-party developers are constantly using alternative technologies to achieve location knowledge. For instance, network operators (that have access to information coming from the lower layers of the network) can reconstruct users positions and trajectories by inferring them through the visited cell-towers [3] . However, the most used technique to get positioning information without the explicit gathering of GPS data is IP Geolocation, GeoIP for short. This practice is very common, and it is used for important tasks in the online services landscape, including geofencing [4] , fraud detection, and online advertising [5] , [6] , our focus.\nAs demonstrated by recent studies [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , data brokers and ad-tech providers track and create profiles from user activities using any kind of data items and the physical location of end users is just one of them. It is important to note that GeoIP is by far the most employed methodology. According to our data, coming from an online advertising stakeholder, which we will describe in detail in \u00a73, at least 50% of the handled ad-requests by an online advertising stakeholder included a user location inferred through an IP Geolocation Database, GeoIP Database for short.\nPhysically pinpointing Internet hosts on the earth is a problem that has been studied in the early 2000s [12] with active measurement technologies, and several GeoIP databases have been available for getting the latitude and longitude information given an IP address for over ten years.",
        "Graphs are widely used data structures that capture relational and structural information between individual entities (nodes) via connections (edges) in many domains. For example, in social networks, a graph-based learning system leverages structural and feature information to make accurate user recommendations. Similarly, in an e-commerce platform, a transaction network can be used to detect fraudulent transactions. Real-world graphs are diverse. For a simple recommendation scenario consisting of user and item nodes, the user nodes would include information about age, gender, and income. Whereas the item nodes (e.g. a movie) would be characterized by the genre, length, and list of actors. Additionally, edge features may contain information about the rating the user gave a movie. Such attributed graphs are prevalent, where the graph dataset's structure is enriched with features of the nodes and edges.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have recently received increasing attention due to the wide range of applications that deal with data naturally represented as graphs. Motivated by similar developments in other domains, there have been efforts to extend the benefit of deep learning to this non-Euclidean domain enabling more streamlined approaches that leverage the relational data. Various methods have been developed to learn from graph data, such as Node2Vec [14] , graph convolution networks (GCN) [21] , and graph attention networks (GAT) [40] which have been used for a variety of tasks including node classification [21] , link prediction [26] , graph clustering [16] . These methods are collectively referred to as geometric deep learning [6] .\nA central problem in geometric deep learning is the need for real-world datasets that are large enough for industry-scale problems. Most of the larger public datasets are similar and are often derived from academic citation networks [17] , which are too small for these problems. This lack of diversity limits the development of graph neural networks (GNN) and their evaluation. In this work, we propose a framework for synthetic graph generation which can systematically generate graphs with corresponding node or edge features in a scalable manner. Generating realistic large-scale graph datasets, which we define as graphs with billions to trillions of edges that simulate real-world datasets distributions, will enable data sharing and facilitate the development of GNNs that scale to such large graph size.",
        "With the popularization of digital cameras and storage devices, millions images are taken everyday and billion images are hosted in photo-sharing websites and image search engines. A nature problem with such gigantic image collections is how to retrieve the relevant images for everyday users, which is also well known as image retrieval problem. Though image retrieval is with similar user-interaction mode with document retrieval (users provide a few keywords as query, and the machine returns a list of relevant documents), image retrieval is more challenge as machine cannot directly use string matching to check whether the textual query matching with the candidate images. Current image search engines mainly rely on the surrounding texts of an image to represent textual information conveyed in the image, and convert image retrieval into document retrieval. However, surrounding texts are not always available or relevant to the image, which leads large number of images irretrievable or irrelevant.\nIn order to make all images retrievable and improve the relevance of retrieved images, the machine needs the ability to directly measure the image-query similarity by extracting information from image itself. Though sounds intuitive, this is a difficult task and far from being solved for the following two reasons:\n\u2022 Extract semantic information from images is hard even with the state-of-the-art hand crafted image features (e.g., super-vector coding [21], fisher vector [12] , spatial pyramid matching [9] , etc.). \u2022 The number of possible queries is huge even if not infinite, it is impractical to build classifiers query by query as image classification tasks. Recent significant progress in DNN has shown the possibility and superiority in automatically learning representations from raw inputs such as images and texts. Inspired by the success of DNN in image classification and word embedding tasks, we proposed an unified DNN to model the image-query similarity. The proposed DNN unifies Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Word Embedding Network (WEN) to generate representations from images and queries respectively, where the final outputs of CNN and WEN are residing in the same vector space and their inner product is defined as the image-query similarity. CNN has shown its superiority over hand crafted image features in extracting semantic information from images via the automatically learned features [8] , [19] . WEN has been successfully used in natural language processing tasks by learning low dimensional vector representations of words [3] , and query representation is modeled by the linear weighted combination of word vectors. With the unified DNN, both image and query are mapped into the same feature vector space as illustrated in Figure 1 .\nDNN requires large number of training data to learn its parameters. Here, we utilize a large scale clickthrough dataset collected from Bing image search as the training dataset, which contains of 23 million clicked image-query pairs from 11.7 million queries and 1 million images [7] .",
        "A clinically feasible and accurate artificial intelligence (AI)-based disease diagnosis model based on contemporary neuroimaging techniques is highly desirable for precision medicine [11] . Literature has witnessed significant advances of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-based individualized diagnosis, not only relieving tedious human labor but also expanding knowledge on disease mechanisms [12] . Recently, integrated PET/MR equipment has provided a unique opportunity for revealing molecular and anatomical changes with a single scan, making PET/MR study a hot clinical research focus [13] . However, brain studies either used anatomical MR with PET [24] , or treated the two modalities as separate sources in downstream AI models [8] . The potential of PET/MR has yet to be exploited.\nThis paper reports a pioneered research with the advent of simultaneous functional PET/MR (namely sf-PET/MR) for comprehensively characterizing brain metabolic, hemodynamic, and perfusion networks in a single scan for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is not only calling for a paradigm shift in neuroimaging study with concurrently modeled brain connectome, but also revolutionizing previous single or multimodal AI modeling methodology by learning deep representatives from the multifaceted brain connectome at microand macroscopic levels. On the other hand, although integrating multimodal information with deep learning can take advantage of deep representations of these modalities by focusing on either modality fusion [25, 26] , or inter-modality dependency with full modalities [21, 23] , limitations in hardware accessibility in real clinical applications and the extra complexity of AI workflows caused by modality absences further hinder sf-PET/MR's application in real clinical scenarios [9] . The objective of this study is to develop a clinically feasible AI model for multimodal sf-PET/MR integration and uni-model diagnosis in common clinical settings. This model has to be powerful enough to have both multimodal-like accuracy and uni-model flexibility, while capable of modeling concurrently acquired, high-dimensional, non-Euclidean, and complementary brain multifaceted sf-PET/MR connectome.\nInstead of using traditional modality fusion strategy that requires full-modality data during inference, we propose a multimodal MiXture-of-experts Alignment and Reconstruction Model (MX-ARM) that adopts a modality-detachable architecture to ease full-modality requirement for inference. The Mixture-of-Experts uses a fingerprint-based router to dynamically allocate modality-specific, learnable weights (\"fingerprints\") for a combination of various multi-layer perceptrons (\"experts\"). This design closes the gap of inherent data bias among different modalities and supports uni-modal inference without sacrificing model performance, since the combination of the experts is modality independent.",
        "Optimizing networks for the distribution of quantities like passengers in a transportation network or data packets in a communication network is a relevant matter for network planners. Similar problems arise in natural systems like river basins and vascular networks. A variety of models have been proposed to study these systems within an optimization framework [1] [2] [3] [4] . The standard goal is to find the values of flow and the network topology that minimize a transportation cost. A common choice for this cost is the total power dissipation [1, 2, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , but alternatives can be adopted depending on the application, see for instance [10] . More recently, different approaches based on a dynamical adaptation of network properties coupled with conservation laws have been proposed [5, 6] . These models can be reformulated within the framework of optimal transport theory, following the work of [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Very efficient computational techniques have been developed for solving such optimal transport based models [13] [14] [15] .\nIn all these systems there is a unique undistinguishable flow traveling through the network. However, it may occur that flows of different types compete in the network infrastructure, yet all the physical models mentioned above have been developed for one type of flow only. One could use these methods to analyze multi-commodity problems by either aggregating together all flow types or by treating them independently. In either case, one loses the important information of how interacting commodities affect the flow, which constitutes the multi-commodity character of these settings. Multi-commodity-specific methods that rely on standard optimization suffer of high computational costs caused by the simultaneous assignment of multiple interacting paths to minimize a global cost function. As a consequence, existing multi-commodity flow algorithms rely on ignoring these interactions, or use greedy heuristics and approximations that lead to suboptimal solutions [18] . Approaches based on statistical physics and message-passing algorithms have improved results [19, 20] but remain computationally costly.\nIn this work, we propose a model to design the topology of optimal networks where multiple resources are moved together. This is based on principles of optimal transport theory similar to those studied in [16, 17] . Assuming potential-driven flows, this optimal design problem is posed as that of finding the distribution of multicommodity fluxes that minimize a global cost functional, or equivalently, as that of finding the optimal edge conductivities. The cost functional is the multi-commodity extension of the optimal-transport Lyapunov functional proposed in [14, 15] . It is given by the sum of the convex cost incurred in transporting all the commodities across the network, summed to a concave cost proportional to the total flux on the network. This second term can be interpreted as the cost for building and maintaining the transport infrastructure, and controls traffic congestion on the network edges by either distributing fluxes on many edges, or by concentrating them on fewer edges following a principle of economy of scale.\nAdditionally, we show that the problem of minimizing the proposed cost functional is equivalent to a constrained optimization problem that generalizes the one-commodity case. The optimal distribution of fluxes is used to identify the optimal network topology by discarding edges where conductivities are small. Within this optimization framework, numerical experiments supported by analytical evidence lead to the important result that optimal network topologies may have loops as a consequence of distinguishing flow types. Generally, loops are pervasive in both natural and anthropic networks [7, [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, in one-commodity settings, several studies have shown that trees are often optimal [1, 2] , while few results show that loops can be obtained by fluctuating flows or by aiming at increased robustness to damage [3, 5, 7] . This implies either changing the type of cost function or introducing stochasticity in the sources and sinks.",
        "After years of development, deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success on visual classification tasks [17, 39, 21, 32] . The outstanding performance, however, heavily relies on large-scale labeled datasets [5] . Meanwhile, although some large-scale public datasets, e.g. Ima-geNet [9] , have made it possible to achieve better than human performance on common objects recognition, practical applications of visual classification systems usually target at categories whose samples are very difficult to collect, e.g. medical images. The scarcity of data limits the generalization of current vision systems. Therefore, it is essential to learn to generalize to novel classes with a limited number of labeled samples available in each class. Cross-domain fewshot learning (CDFSL) is proposed to recognize instances of novel categories in the target domain with few labeled samples. Different from general few-shot learning(FSL) where large-scale source dataset and few-shot novel dataset are from the same domain, target dataset and source dataset under CDFSL setting come from different domains, i.e. the marginal distributions of features of images in two domains are quite different [52] .\nMuch work has been done to solve FSL problem and obtained promising results [44, 14, 37, 38, 11, 35, 46] . However, [6, 16] show that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) metalearning based FSL methods fail to generalize well and perform poorly under CDFSL setting. It is therefore of great importance to improve the generalization capability of the model and address the domain shift issue from source to target domains. [41] proposes to add a feature-transformation layer to simulate various distributions of image features in training. However, this method requires access to a great amount of data from multiple domains during training. [50] combines the FSL learning objective and the domain adaptation objective, while their basic assumption that source and target domain have identical label sets limits its application. [16] experimentally shows that the traditional transfer learning methods can outperform meta-learning FSL methods by a large margin on the benchmark. In these methods, a feature extractor is pre-trained on the source dataset and then fine-tuned on the target dataset with only a few labeled samples. Following this thread, [27] proposes to regularize the eigenvalues of the image features to avoid negative knowledge transfer.\nIn this work, our observation is that generalization capability plays a vital role for representation learning in crossdomain settings. As the feature distributions of different domains are distinct, a competent feature extractor on the source domain does not necessarily lead to good performance on the target domain. It may overfit to the source domain and fail to generalize in the target domain. Fig. 1(a) shows an example of a less-generalized feature extractor f a that fits the source dataset very well and achieves high performance in downstream classification task. When the model is transferred to a different target domain, as shown in Fig. 1(c ), the corresponding feature embeddings of different classes may become less discriminative or even inseparable. On the other hand, a less perfect feature extractor f b on the source domain (Fig. 1(b )), may have stronger generalization capability and obtain more discriminative feature embeddings in the target domain (Fig. 1(d) ). Under this intuition, we focus on boosting the generalization capability of the transfer learning based methods, and investigate a multi-task learning scheme that shows the potential to improve generalization performance in [22] .",
        "Recommender System (RS) has recently become a crucial tool to alleviate information overload in many areas with rich data, including but not limited to e-commerce, education, finance, and health [Zhu et al., 2021] . As a pivotal technology of RS, Collaborative Filtering (CF) has received thrilling success owing to its inherent domain-independent and easy-toexplain properties. Specifically, CF attempts to learn representations of users and items from their interactive information for the subsequent user preference prediction and item recommendation [Chen et al., 2022] . However, with the explosive growth of users and items, CF based recommendation methods often suffer from high time and space costs [Qi et al., 2021a] .\nFortunately, hash-based CF (Hash-CF) approaches [Chen et al., 2018] have been proven to have a good ability to compress data and accelerate computation for recommendations with billion-scale users and items [Shan et al., 2018] . In large-scale recommendation scenarios, Hash-CF takes effect by encoding high dimensional real-valued vectors into compact one-hot codes (hash representations), such that: (1) bitwise operations (e.g., XOR) instead of real-valued calculations for preference inference can dramatically accelerate recommendations; (2) bit-wise representations often achieve a 64\u00d7 storage compression rate compared to real-valued representations. Therefore, Hash-CF enables a lighter and more efficient recommendation model even massive data are involved in decision-makings.\nHowever, existing Hash-CF approaches often face two challenges existing in the learned hash representations. Firstly, CH1: how to implement optimization on discrete hash representations? The hash representation is usually obtained through the sign function, and optimizing such a representation will lead to a challenging mixed-binary-integer optimization problem [Wang et al., 2018] , which is NP-hard. A promising solution is to replace the sign function with a continuous relaxation (e.g., tanh function) to learn deterministic hash representations in an end-to-end manner, which, however, is not robust due to a lack of noise tolerance consideration. Fortunately, Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [Kingma and Welling, 2014] with its probabilistic nature can model features as distributions to accommodate much uncertainty or noisy in data, so as to implement robust recommendation [Liang et al., 2018] . However, for the Hash-CF task, features need to be modeled as latent discrete Bernoulli distributions to generate hash representations. Such distributions with discrete nature make the optimization on hash representations more difficult. Secondly, CH2: how to preserve semantic information in discrete representations?A hash representation has intrinsically limited representation ability, as it carries less semantic information than a real-valued representation. Although the existing Hash-CF approaches [Zhang et al., 2016] try to control quantization loss to reduce the difference between real-valued and hash representations, they fail to preserve the semantic structure consistency between them.",
        "Correlation matrices capture pairwise similarity of multiple, often temporally evolving signals, and are used to describe system interactions in various diverse disciplines of science and society, from financial economics to psychology, bioinformatics, neuroscience, and climate science, to name a few. Correlation analysis is often a first step in trying to understand complex systems data [1] . Existing methods for analyzing correlation matrix data are abundant. Very well established methods include principal component analysis (PCA) [2] and factor analysis (FA) [3, 4] , which can yield a small number of interpretable components from correlation matrices, such as a global market trend when applied to stock market data, or spatio-temporal patterns of air pressure when applied to atmospheric data. Another major method for analyzing correlation matrix data is the Markowitz's portfolio theory in mathematical finance, which aims to minimize the variance of financial returns while keeping the expected return above a given threshold [5, 6] . In a related vein, random matrix theory has been a key theoretical tool for analyzing economic and other correlation matrix data for a couple of decades [6] . Various new methods for analyzing correlation matrix data have also been proposed. Examples include detrended cross-correlation analysis [7] [8] [9] , correlation dependency, defined as the difference between the partial correlation coefficient and the Pearson correlation coefficient given three nodes [10, 11] , determination of optimal paths between distant locations in correlation matrix data [12] , early warning signals for anticipating abrupt changes in multidimensional dynamical systems including the case of networked systems [13] [14] [15] , and energy landscape analysis for multivariate time series data particularly employed in neuroscience [16, 17] .\nThe last two decades have also seen successful applications of tools from network science and graph theory to correlational data.",
        "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been rapidly emerging as an important framework, using interconnected sensors, actuators, and related devices not only for automation, but also for interconnectivity between subparts of the network, thereby facilitating decision-making processes within the industrial ecosystem. IIoT goes beyond traditional data collection, focusing instead on streamlining operations and facilitating seamless communication between subcomponents of the network. This paradigm not only drives digital transformation but also facilitates automation and optimizes efficiency across diverse sectors such as water, manufacturing, energy, infrastructure management, and healthcare [1], [2] . However, Keivan Faghih Niresi and Olga Fink are with Intelligent Maintenance and Operations Systems (IMOS) Lab, EPFL, Switzerland, e-mail: (keivan.faghihniresi@epfl.ch, olga.fink@epfl.ch) Hugo Bissig and Henri Baumann are with Swiss Federal Institute of Metrology (METAS).\nThe reliability of IIoT strongly depends on the quality of data and information gathered through sensor networks integrated into complex systems [3] . Therefore, achieving highly reliable measurements in IIoT may encounter obstacles such as the cost of installing large numbers of sensors, limitations in retrofitting existing systems with sensors, sparse deployment of sensors, malfunctioning sensors, energy constraints associated with deploying dense sensor networks, and harsh environmental conditions that may make sensor installation impractical [4] . As a result, instead of solely relying on expensive hardware solutions to address these obstacles, they can be effectively addressed through computational sensing techniques, thereby unlocking the full potential of intelligent systems facilitated by IIoT.\nSoft (virtual) sensing presents a promising method for augmenting the capabilities of physical sensors, improving data quality, and enhancing the efficacy of IIoT in monitoring complex system operations [5] - [7] . Specifically, a soft sensor functions as a mathematical model that estimates desired variables at new target locations using data collected from physical sensors. Soft sensors prove to be valuable for inferring variables in places where physical sensors are unavailable [4] . In soft sensing, two primary approaches have been employed: data-driven and physics-based modeling.\nTraditionally, first principle approaches and methods like the Kalman filter and observers have been used to estimate model parameters [8] . Standard Kalman filters are commonly used within first-principles-based approaches for model parameter estimation [9] . However, these approaches typically presume linearity in both the system and observation model equations [10] , whereas many real-world industrial processes exhibit significant nonlinearity. Therefore, adopting a nonlinear process assumption has become crucial to overcome this limitation and expand the application of soft sensors in actual industrial scenarios [11] . In such cases, alternative methods such as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) [12] , the squareroot UKF (SR-UKF) [13] , and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) [14] , become feasible choices. Nevertheless, developing physics-based soft sensors requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying processes and significant effort for model development.\nWhen the system's underlying physical processes pose challenges for state estimation, data-driven approaches are typically preferred [15] . The development of data-driven soft sensing approaches has involved various multivariate statistical and machine learning approaches, including principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLS), and support vector machines (SVM) [16] . Deep learn-ing techniques are particularly noteworthy for their ability to autonomously learn features, eliminating the need for laborious feature engineering -this is especially advantageous in scenarios where a thorough understanding of domain-specific features is absent [17] .",
        "Deep latent variable models have started to outperform conventional baselines on lossy compression of images [4, 7, 25, 14, 15, 24, 23, 33, 36] , video [19, 8, 21, 31, 37, 20, 27, 6, 12] , and audio [39, 36] . Nearly all of these methods use a loss function of the form D + \u03b2R, where D measures distortion, R measures bitrate, and \u03b2 is a fixed tradeoff parameter. We refer to this approach as \u03b2-VAE [13] , because this loss can be motivated from a variational perspective [12] .\nDespite its popularity, \u03b2-VAE has several drawbacks. Firstly, setting \u03b2 to target a specific point in the R/D plane can be tricky. One can show that a model trained with a given \u03b2 should end up at that point on the R/D curve where the slope \u2202R \u2202D equals \u03b2 [1] . However, because the shape of the R/D curve depends on the model and hyperparameters, and because the R/D curve can be very steep or flat in the low or high bitrate regime, choosing \u03b2 can be difficult.\nSecondly, in order to compare models it is not sufficient to train one instance of each model because the converged models would likely differ in both rate and distortion, which yields inconclusive results unless one model dominates the other on both metrics. Instead, to compare models we need to train both at several \u03b2 values to generate R/D curves that can be compared, which is computationally costly and slows down the research iteration cycle.\nA more natural way to target different regions of the R/D plane is to set a distortion constraint and find our model parameters through constrained optimization:\nEQUATION\nwhere \u03b8 refers to the joint parameters of the encoder, decoder and prior, and c D is a distortion target. We can control the rate-distortion tradeoff by setting the distortion target value c D . Setting this value is more intuitive than setting \u03b2, as it is independent of the slope of the R/D curve, and hence independent of model and hyperparameters.\nAs a result, we can easily compare two different models trained with the same distortion constraint; as we have fixed the D axis we only have to look at the R performance for each model.\nNote that one could also minimize the distortion subject to a rate constraint. This is less straightforward as putting too much emphasis on the rate loss at the beginning of training can lead to posterior collapse [3, 11, 40, 28, 32] .\nThere is a large literature on constrained optimization, but most of it does not consider stochastic optimization and is limited to convex loss functions.",
        "The use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image synthesis is one of the most fascinating outcomes of the emerging deep learning era, leading to impressive results across various generative-based tasks [3, 10, 16, 17, 19, 31, 44] . Although leading to impressive results, GANs are difficult to train and prone to undesired phenomena, such as mode collapse, failure to converge, and vanishing gradients [38] . Much of the research in this field has been focusing on mitigating the above difficulties and on stabilizing the training process, mainly by heuristically modifying the architectures of the generator and the discriminator, and by exposing new and better-behaved training losses [1, 13, 24, 33] . As such, while GANs, in general, have been extensively studied and redesigned, the generator itself still operates as a \"black-box\" of unjustified architecture and meaning.\nMotivated by the sparse modeling literature [9] , we propose a novel interpretation that sheds light on the architecture of image generators and provides a meaningful and effective regularization to it. We interpret generators as implicitly relying on sparse models in general and the Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) and its Multi-Layered (ML-CSC) version in particular [2, 5, 11, 14, 27, 29, [35] [36] [37] (we provide a comprehensive overview of sparse coding in Sec. 2). This observation provides a possible explanation for the generator's intermediate mappings. We harness this insight by proposing a general model-based approach to regularize image generators which can be applied easily to various architectures. We validate our proposed view by conducting extensive experiments on a variety of wellknown GAN architectures, from relatively simple to up-todate ones, and show substantial performance gains.\nWe further extend our contribution by demonstrating that the same rationale and improvement are valid for other image generator neural networks. More specifically, we apply the proposed regularizations to the Deep Image Prior (DIP) algorithm [40] for solving image denoising.",
        "Intonation drift is an important topic in analyzing unaccompanied singing and has been discussed in MIR literature from various angles. In order to study the drift, we need to assume a reference pitch, and then measure the deviation from that reference pitch in the course of a segment or performance. Intonation drift happens both in choirs and solo singing, and it usually occurs in the downward direction [1] , [2] , and [3] . Harmonic progression has been mentioned as one of the causes of drift in choir [4] and [5] . In this paper, we consider drift in solo singing. Our main goal is to computationally measure the drift in the course of a performance.\nThe methodology is discussed in sections 2 to 5. In order to explain the detail we have used an example of a performance2 with duration 5':32\" (Example 1). It starts with an introduction for about 48 seconds, before the main part starts at the second 00:52.",
        "How much are two given words related? In general, the way of automatically computing a degree of relatedness between words falls into one of the following categories of methods [22] : corpus-based methods, which use large corpora of natural language texts, and exploit co-occurrences of words, as for instance [47] ; knowledge-based methods, which rely on structured resources, as for instance [13] ; and hybrid methods, which are a mix of the two, as for instance [38] . Corpus-based methods benefit from the huge availability of textual documents and the advancements in the field of natural language processing and, for this reason, they have been widely investigated in the literature for a long time. Knowledge-based methods mainly depend on the availability and the quality of a proper knowledge base, such as a knowledge graph or an ontology. These methods require words to be associated with resources in the knowledge base in order to shift from a pure linguistic dimension to a knowledge-based one. This paper focuses on knowledge-based methods.\nSince the advent of the Semantic Web, ontologies have become significant knowledge representation tools, especially when advanced reasoning is required. However, ontologies suffer from some drawbacks: (i) they are usually manually or semi-manually created and maintained, and this can be very costly; (ii) general purpose ontologies, such as WordNet 2 , contain a limited number of relations between concepts, mainly hierarchical relations (is a and part of ) Resim (Resource Similarity) measure for evaluating semantic similarity of DBpedia resources and, successively, in [44] they address the more general problem of relatedness, and propose an approach that is one of the 10 methods selected for the experimentation of this work (see Section 5.2 and also Section A.2.2). Note that similarity is fundamental also in clustering [6] , aimed at partitioning data into similar groups, which has been extensively investigated in the literature. For example in ontology matching, in order to deal with large scale ontologies, it is necessary to decompose the huge number of instances into a small number of clusters. Clustering is addressed for ontology matching for instance in [10] . In particular, the proposed approach aims at extracting sets of instances from a given ontology and grouping them into subsets in order to evaluate the common instances between different ontologies. Clustering on semantic spaces is also used for the summarization of image collections and self-supervision, as for instance in [54] .\nIn the following, we restrict our attention to the literature addressing semantic relatedness, that is the focus of this paper, rather than the more specific notion of semantic similarity. Note that semantic relatedness measures defined for specific domains and experimented on specific datasets (as for instance in biomedicine [31] ) have not been addressed in this paper because experiments show that some of them, that are effective for a specific task or an application area, do not perform well in general [22] .\nBelow, the approaches from the literature have been organized according to three main groups, relying on WordNet, Wikipedia, and Machine Learning techniques, respectively. Before introducing them, it is worth mentioning two recent methods presented in [39] and [2] , respectively. The former proposes a new measure within recommender systems which evaluates the closeness of items across domains in order to generate relevant recommendations for new users in the target domain. Essentially, such a measure is based on the total number of web pages where the words describing the compared items occur together. According to the latter, semantic relatedness is evaluated for unstructured data by relying on fuzzy vectors and by using different semantic relatedness techniques. However, both these approaches are not knowledge-based and for this reason they have not been considered in our experiment.\nWordNet. WordNet can be considered as a relatively simple knowledge graph designed to semantically model the English lexicon. It contains mainly taxonomic relations (is a), and part-whole (part of ) relations, whereas a few thematic relations are present (see the next section where semantic relations have been recalled). In the literature, several approaches for computing semantic relatedness have been proposed by leveraging WordNet knowledge graph, as for instance [57, 5, 33] . In particular, in [57] , the problem of measuring semantic relatedness in labeled tree data is addressed by leveraging the is a and part of hierarchies of WordNet. In [5] , the authors state that the majority of the proposed methods rely on the is a relation, and introduce a new approach to measure semantic relatedness between concepts based on weighted paths defined by non-taxonomic relations in WordNet. In [33] , semantic relatedness is evaluated by following different strategies in order to improve computation performances, by combining WordNet with word embedding methods. Furthermore, it is worth recalling that in [59] the authors define an algorithm for semantic relatedness relying on random walks, i.e., generalizations of paths where cycles are allowed, that has been evaluated on WordNet. However, as mentioned by the same authors, WordNet is relatively small, and an evaluation of the performances of their proposal on larger knowledge graphs, such as DBpedia, is missing.",
        "Network slicing has been widely investigated in 5G and beyond to support different network services in terms of costefficiency, flexibility, and assurance [1] . The ever-increasingly disaggregated network elements with fine-grained controllability may lead to volatile network dynamics in various aspects, e.g., admission and departure of slices in small time scales [2] . As a result, allocating radio resources to dynamic network slices becomes even more challenging.\nThe problem of resource allocation in network slicing has been extensively studied in the scenario of individual cells, where allocations are mostly optimized under the assumption that the resource demand of slices is known in advance. Existing works derive their solutions by formulating analytical closed-form models and solving the network slicing problem using constrained nonlinear optimization methods. In [3] , the authors initially formulated and streamlined the slicewise resource allocation problem by finding the upper and lower bound of network utility using the Lagrangian method. Subsequently, a sub-optimal solution was obtained using a greedy algorithm. Although the derived simplified model is effective, it is still tailored to specific slice configurations. In [4] , authors proposed a flexible slice deployment solution with dynamic slice configurations, which formulated a slice model with adjustable parameters and solved resource partition with an optimization process. However, recent findings [5] , [6] show that these approximated models cannot accurately represent diverse demand and performance of slices.\nWith recent advances in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been increasingly explored to tackle complex allocation problems in dynamic mobile networks. Zhou et al. [7] designed a multi-agent RL framework based on Q-Learning to determine the optimal joint resource allocation by using a coordinated Q-table, which alleviates the inter-slice resource constraints. However, this solution cannot scale to large state and action spaces. Our previous work [8] investigated coordinated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to handle the high-dimensional continuous action space and complex resource optimization in network slicing, where the inter-slice resource constraints are embedded in the designed architecture of neural networks. However, the proposed solution was explicitly trained for a fixed network scenario, and can hardly be generalized for different slice setups in terms of slice type and slice number. Liu et al. [9] introduced an approach to combine DRL and optimization process for slicing resource allocation in a single cell scenario. Yet, it also lacks the discussion of generalizing the solution to different multi-cell network scenarios with flexible slice setups.\nIn this paper, we present a novel algorithm, called integrated deep learning and Lagrangian method (IDLA), that optimizes slicing resource allocation and can be generalized to adapt to arbitrary slice combinations under time-varying dynamics. The main contributions of this work are listed as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a novel framework that integrates deep learning models (that have approximation capability) and constrained optimization methods (that have strong generalization) and can generalize to arbitrary slice combinations. derivatives of the slice utility function approximated by the DNN model, we design a Lagrangian method for resolving the optimal resource allocation on a per-slice basis, while adhering to inter-slice resource constraints.",
        "Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) belongs to a class of manufacturing processes known as additive manufacturing (AM). Commonly referred to as \"three-dimensional (3-D) printing,\" these processes have rapidly grown in popularity and market size due to their ability to produce parts of complex geometry, with engineering properties meeting or exceeding those produced by conventional manufacturing processes, while removing the majority of the overhead costs normally associated with production [1] [2] [3] . The PBF process (Fig. 1 ) builds three-dimensional parts out of layers of metal powder, using a build cycle consisting of three stages: 1) sweeping a thin layer of powder over a base of metal feedstock or previously-applied powder, 2) selectively melting a pattern of desired geometry into the powder by application of a high-powered laser or electron beam (e-beam), and 3) lowering the build platform in the -z direction to accommodate a fresh layer of powder. The PBF process is not without flaws. It is well-documented that parts manufactured with PBF display high levels of residual stresses [5] [6] [7] , porosity [8] [9] [10] , and anisotropy in material properties [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , and that these defects are a direct consequence of the thermal management of the PBF process during production. Although thermal management is critical for the manufacture of high-quality parts, current PBF machines operate in open-loop, with the irradiated energy to the system, u, specified by a schedule directed by G-Code machine language [15] . Appropriate parameter values that govern the schedule are determined through operator experience, heuristically through design-of-experiment procedures [16] and/or with computationally complex predictive models [17] . Significant advances in PBF production quality could be achieved with feedback control of the thermal management problem. Despite the need for thermal management of PBF, the community has not established the theory to evaluate the basic criteria for modern control synthesis: the requirement that the process is controllable and observable. This paper answers this basic question. Our analysis is aspirational, considering both current and emerging thermal actuation and sensing hardware capabilities and we do not consider computational constraints during model construction. The aim is to establish a controls theoretic basis for PBF, thus providing a framework to apply modern controls tools such as multivariable robust controllers, state estimators, and fault detection schemes to this important, emerging manufacturing modality.\nThroughout this paper we reference the nomenclature tabulated in Table 1 .",
        "Crowd counting has attracted much attention in recent years due to its important application including video surveillance, public security, et al. In addition, it is a key technique for high-level behavior analysis algorithms, such as crowd behavior analysis, crowd gathering detection. Specifically, crowd density estimation is also beneficial to prevent the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus. However, scale variations, huge crowd diversity, and background clutter are critical challenges of crowd counting. As shown in Figure 1 , the head scale within an image is varying due to camera perspective, and the crowd distribution across scenes also represents different patterns. Some CNN-based methods usually overestimate the density map of backgrounds due to the complexity of backgrounds, as analyzed in some crowd counting review papers [1] , [2] . Besides, some gridded areas (such as trees and buildings) are more likely to be mistaken in density map because the appearance of backgrounds is very similar to that congested crowd areas. To address the scale variations issue, many multi-column Fig. 1 . Some samples contain scale variations and background clutter in the ShanghaiTech dataset. The red rectangle indicates some human heads of different sizes. The green rectangle contains some clutters similar to the crowd area, especially the high-density crowd. The first column shows the original image, the second column shows the ground-truth density map, and the third column is the predicted density map from CSRNet method [3] in 2018. network based methods [4] - [7] are proposed to extract multiscale features, where different column networks are designed with different kernel sizes. However, these multi-column based methods have a more bloated structure, which lead to redundant information of each subnetwork, as analyzed in CSRNet [3] . Besides, inspired by inception architecture, some scaleaware modules [8] , [9] adopt multiple various convolution kernels with different receptive fields to extract features at various scales. These modules can be plugged directly into the existing single column network. The advantage of singlecolumn-based methods is their elegant network structure and high training efficiency. However, the rate of dilated kernel at different columns needs to be carefully selected in these scale-aware modules, which is challenging to capture various continuous scales.",
        "The sixth generation (6G) of wireless mobile networks are expected to have key performance indicators such as 1 Gbps data rates (per user), ultra-low latency (1 ms or less), massive numbers of devices, and ultra-high reliability (99.99999%) [1] . 6G will also offer significant improvement in programmability and quality of service (QoS) by leveraging technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), multi-access edge computing (MEC), in-network computing, dynamic orchestration, and machine-learning/artificial-intelligence (ML/AI). All these features make 6G networks a complex infrastructure that provides a plenty of opportunity to incorporate non-traditional resiliency capabilities in the network for networked applications.\nSystems built to protect human lives are increasingly deployed over communication networks. Examples of these systems are the smart city, smart agriculture, power grid, autonomous vehicle traffic systems, tactical defense networks, and emergency response systems. When communication breaks or is delayed, it puts human lives in danger. For example, delay in notifying a frequency drift in a smart grid network will not start the power generation at the right time and cause the entire grid to collapse in a ripple effect.\nThe current generation of networks (are expected to) meet their mission objectives under normal operating conditions, but we envision 6G-enabled systems (with an architecture that exploits the advanced features intelligently such as the one proposed here) will be capable of meeting mission objectives even during disruptions. In order to handle a wide variety of adversarial and failure conditions, resiliency should be a pillar of 6G system design and architecture. In the context of 6G systems, resiliency can be defined as the ability to survive, gracefully adapt to, and rapidly recover from malicious attacks, component failures, and natural and human-induced disruptions.\nTo provide resiliency, the traditional approach is to replicate a component so that when one instance goes down, the rest can handle new requests [2] . However, replication is limited to homogeneous stack environments containing similar hardware, operating system, libraries, etc. This work takes a step beyond the current state-of-the-art to restore the critical functionality. We propose to restore critical functionality by adapting it on to the available non-homogeneous resources in the device-toedge-to-cloud continuum of 6G networks.\nWe envision a La R\u00e9sistance 6G (LR6G) network with adaptive resiliency. To motivate this, let us consider the following example. A critical function/service hosted on the C-RAN is disrupted due to a security (say reflective DDoS) attack. The Edge-to-Cloud network is flooded and is dropping all benign packets as suspicious. The only resilient option is to harness a few small IoT devices to put up a valiant fight against the adversary.\n5G network relaxes the association of network function to a part of the network (e.g., 5G Core or NG-RAN). 5G operator chooses a placement that optimizes their objective function. The 5G network does not yet understand the notional loss resulting out of the service disruption.",
        "Spurious correlations are unintended associations or biases learned by models, between the input image and the target label, often resulting from factors like data selection biases (Torralba and Efros, 2011; Jabri et al., 2016) . The repeated co-occurrence of certain features (like foreground objects or backgrounds), with a more than average chance, within ASPIRE automatically detects non-predictive spuriously correlated features for each class (e.g., indoor background for small dogs) and generates synthetic images without them (small dogs in an outdoor background). These images can then be added to the train set to learn a more robust image classifier. instances of a particular class leads the model to learn shortcuts and focus on these spurious nonpredictive features for prediction than core ones. For example, most of the images in ImageNet dataset (Deng et al., 2009) labeled as Dog Sled also show a dog, and image classifiers trained on ImageNet fail to correctly identify an image of a dog sled without a dog in it.\nInstances of a class in the training set where the co-occurring spurious features are present are commonly known as majority groups, while atypical instances where such spurious features are absent are known as minority groups. Deep neural networks trained on these datasets poorly generalize on minority groups (naturally due to their scarcity) and thus can exhibit significant performance degradation on minority groups in the test (Sagawa et al., 2019) , or in real-world scenarios when encountering domain shift (Arjovsky et al., 2019) . Learning such correlations also hurt the performance of various Computer Vision (CV) applications such as visual question-answering (Liu et al., 2023c) , retrieval (Kong et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023) , classification (Liu et al., 2021a) , etc. Teaching meaningful data representations to deep neural networks that avoid over-reliance on spurious features remains a central challenge in CV.\nWhen training over-parameterized deep neural networks, there are multiple solutions with the same loss values at any given training stage, and the optimizer usually gravitates towards a solution with lesser complexity (or tends to learn a shortcut) (Wilson et al., 2017; Valle-Perez et al., 2018; Arpit et al., 2017; Kalimeris et al., 2019) . When faced with co-occurring spurious features, the optimizer may preferentially utilize them, as they often require less complexity than the anticipated semantic signals of interest (Bruna and Mallat, 2013; Bruna et al., 2015; Brendel and Bethge, 2019; Khani and Liang, 2021) .\nLearning classifiers robust to spurious correlations is an active area of research (Sagawa* et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a; Kirichenko et al., 2023) , where researchers generally employ different learning techniques with the assumption that annotated data for the minority groups exist in the training dataset. Most of these works are built on the same base principle: improved generalization on minority groups can lead to a more robust classifier. Despite extensive research in deep learning indicating that more data may lead to better generalization, little effort has been made to leverage this principle specifically for building robust classifiers.",
        "Delving into the realm of egocentric vision (first-person view), the pursuit of refining 3D hand pose estimation stands as a keystone for understanding human activity. This quest not only forges new paths in human-computer interaction [31, 34, 38] , but also empowers imitation learning [8, 13, 37] . Moreover, it enhances the immersive experience in augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) to new heights [ 15, 33] . Recently, with the advancements of AR/VR headsets, egocentric data has become increasingly prevalent [5, 10] , leading to an increasing demand for estimating 3D hand poses from egocentric viewpoints.\nTo achieve better 3D hand pose estimation performance, recent years have witnessed many networks with various structures [7, 39, 44] . However, the majority of existing hand pose estimation methods are still under a single-view setting, which is convenient but leads to potential limitations, e.g., limited field-of-view and ambiguity in depth. To address these problems, a potential solution is to add another camera to expand the field-of-view and reduce depth ambiguity by capturing the hand shape from an additional view angle. Furthermore, the use of multiple cameras also aligns with industry trends, as demonstrated by the latest AR/VR headsets such as the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest, which feature multiple egocentric cameras. Overall, an unavoidable trend towards multi-view settings in hand pose estimation is emerging, driven by its technological advantages and the direction of industrial development.\nCurrently, several existing studies [4, 12, 19] have paid attention to hand pose estimation under multi-view settings. These methods typically process input images from multi- ple views simultaneously, utilizing a feature fusion module to arrive at a final prediction [22, 41] . However, all these methods have two significant drawbacks that limit their applicability. 1) The training, especially for the feature fusion module, necessitates multi-view labels, which are costly to annotate. 2) During testing, the same camera parameters as in training must be used. An estimator trained under a specific multi-camera setup becomes inapplicable if there are any changes to the camera layout or parameters. Unlike existing multi-view training methods, we propose a new solution that adapts an estimator from single-view to dual-view without needing multi-view labels or camera parameters. As shown in Fig. 1 , given a pre-trained estimator, our method adapts it to an arbitrary dual-view setting (from (a) to (b)), where two cameras are placed in any layout without knowing their parameters. Here, all we need is a pre-trained estimator and a sufficient number of unlabeled dual-view inputs from the two cameras. As compared in Tab. 1 (row 2-3), in contrast to multi-view training, our method only needs common and cheaper single-view data for training.",
        "Fashion is an essential part of human experiences and has grown into an industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars in US alone 1 . With the rapid growth of online shopping, fashion related understanding systems, such as those for outfit recommendation, are now in a great need. Over the last few years, there has been a remarkable progress in fashion related research, including clothing attribute prediction and landmark detection [11, 21] , fashion recommendation [5, 8, 24] , clothing item retrieval [10, 22] , clothing parsing [1, 4] and outfit recommendation [2, 7, 12, 19] .\nIn this paper, we focus on the outfit recommendation problem. An outfit consists of items of different (fine-grained) categories (e.g. sweater, jeans, boots, school bag) that have visual aesthetic relationship with one another. For outfit recommendation, it requires the learning of compatibility [2, 3, 13, 19, 20] to show how multiple visual items interact with each other, instead of presenting the similarity between items.\nExisting studies on outfit recommendation mainly fall into three branches. The first one [7, 13] treats an outfit as a set and trains a binary classifier to determine if an outfit is compatible or not based on the concatenation of item features (Figure 1a ). As simple concatenation cannot properly model the relationship among items, methods of this branch usually perform the worst. The second branch [3, 20] tries to minimize the sum of distances between every item pairs in the compatibility space (Figure 1b ). This type of methods usually suffers from the ill-triangle problem, where two in-compatible items can be considered as compatible when they are both compatible with a third one. Although an extended scheme [19] adds the 'type' information to the compatibility learning, it needs to learn the 'type' embedding matrices for every type pair, which is very inefficient as the time complexity is O(n 2 ) for n types of clothes. The third branch [2, 14] considers an outfit as a sequence of items in a pre-defined order (Figure 1c ). It models the compatibility of an outfit using LSTM, which is 'order-dependent'. When the order of the outfit varies, the performance greatly degrades. As another limitation, existing recommendation systems tend to consider only visual aesthetics and meta data such as item descriptions. Although these meta data can be used for describing image features, they are not for compatibility learning. Coarse category information (e.g. tops, bottoms, shoes, etc.) is also applied to define an outfit as a sequence [2, 14] , where an item of a pre-defined coarse category is provided at each time step. Training with only coarse or fine category but not both is not flexible because the category of a query item for inference can be coarse while the model is trained with fine categories. There is a lack of consideration of both category classes in the literature work. To meet the need of customers, both fine-grained and coarse categories should be considered. For example, two customers with the same T-shirt may be interested in different types of pants, such as jeans or sweat pants, rather than simply a 'bottom'. In another case, a customer with a T-shirt wants to have a 'bottom' of any type. To incorporate both fine and coarse category information into the compatibility learning and make the outfit recommendation fit for the flexible need, we introduce the notion tuple.",
        "An important question in temporal data analysis is how to weigh information from the recent past against information from the distant past. Here, we aim to inform this question by building on the framework of rescoring rules, (Webster et al., 1982) , a well-known method from the actigraphy literature.\nNumerous actigraphy studies have used moving window algorithms (MWAs) to predict sleep status (Webster et al. 1982; Cole et al. 1992; Sadeh et al. 1994; Oakley 1997; Sazonov et al. 2004 ; see also the supplementary materials of Palotti et al. 2019 for an especially cohesive summary). Beyond local information in the moving window, Webster et al. 1982 proposed a post hoc series of steps that can be applied to the output of a given MWA in order to incorporate long-term activity patterns. These steps, known as \"Webster's rescoring rules\" for sleep-wake classification, are widely popular, and are frequently referenced as a benchmark that new methods can be compared against (Jean-Louis et al., 2000; Benson et al., 2004; Palotti et al., 2019; Haghayegh et al., 2019 Haghayegh et al., , 2020)) . In their most general form, Webster's rescoring rules can be written as follows, with tuning parameters (constants) a, b, c and d.\nRule 1: After at least a continuous minutes scored by the MWA as wake, identify the next b minutes and rescore these minutes to wake.\nRule 2: If any bout lasting c minutes or less has been scored by the MWA as sleep, and is surrounded by at least d minutes (before and after) scored by the MWA as wake, rescore this bout to wake.\nThe first rule reflects the idea that inactivity onset usually precedes sleep onset by several minutes. The second rule reflects the idea that brief sedentary periods do not necessarily indicate sleep, especially if they are surrounded by long periods of activity. Webster et al. 1982 suggest applying several different versions of each rule simultaneously, setting (a, b) to (4, 1), (10, 3), and (15, 4); and setting (c, d) to (6, 10) and (10, 20) . The resulting rules are illustrated in Figures 1.\nBy adjusting for long term patterns, these post hoc rules can make the accuracy of simple moving window models closer to that of recurrent neural network models (RNNs, Palotti et al., 2019) . This improvement is intuitive, as RNNs often aim to find an optimal representation of long term patterns, after applying an initial moving window (i.e., convolutional) step. An advantage of Webster's rules is that their interpretability helps users to understand when rescoring might not be appropriate, while black-box RNN rules can produce failures that are more difficult to identify.",
        "Attribute-based CTG (Zhang et al., 2022) focuses on generating sentences satisfying pre-specified attributes such as topic and sentiment, which remains extremely challenging in recent progress (Dathathri et al., 2020) . Especially multi-attribute CTG, it is typically unsupervised since no example of a sentence with specified attributes could be obtained during training. (Lample et al., 2019) . Existing * Work is done during internship at DAMO Academy efforts for attribute-based CTG can be roughly divided into two types: fine-tuning and utilizing extra attribute classifiers. The first type usually finetunes a pre-trained language model (PLM) on the attribute-specific data (Ziegler et al., 2019 ), yet stores a full copy of the PLM for each desirable attribute. To partly address this issue, control codes are introduced to generate various styles of sentences with one PLM, such as keywords (Keskar et al., 2019) and numerical sequence (Lyu et al., 2021) . However, re-training whole PLMs could be expensive (Yang and Klein, 2021) and they rarely attend to multi-attribute CTG. The second type introduces extra attribute classifiers to guide a PLM, such as back-propagating gradients of classifiers (Dathathri et al., 2020) or weighting output logits (Krause et al., 2021; Yang and Klein, 2021) . Such a paradigm shows encourage improvement, while the text fluency tends to decrease (see \u00a7 4.2) and inference time increase (Qian et al., 2022) .\nTo overcome the aforementioned limitations, we propose a Text-attribute controllor (Tailor) -a prompt-based approach to attribute-based CTG. The key idea is to represent each attribute as a pretrained continuous vector (hereinafter known as the single-attribute prompt) to control a fixed GPT-2 for single-attribute CTG, and effectively concatenate such single-attribute prompts as a whole for multi-attribute CTG. This allows Tailor to be easily expanded by training the corresponding attribute prompt if a new attribute emerges, while avoiding re-training the whole PLM. In detail, the singleattribute prompt is concatenated with the input prefix and then guides the generation of a fixed GPT-2 switch to a pre-specified attribute. More importantly, we experimentally find that such singleattribute prompts could be simply concatenated to generate sentences with multi attributes. However, this manner always suffers from fluency decrease and position sensitivity, i.e., the PLM tends to focus more on the single-attribute prompt that is closer to Figure 1 : An overview of MAP connector to multi-attribute CTG. MAP connector concatenates single-attribute prompts (i.e., underlines), then continues with a pre-specified input prefix to the fixed GPT-2. Note that, it is able to the unseen combination (e.g, sentiment of Positive and topic of Mexican food).\nthe input prefix (see \u00a7 4.3). To address these issues, the key lies in bridging the gap between the training and the testing stage. In detail, the single-attribute prompt only attends to itself in the attention matrix while training, since it is individually trained by the attribute-specific data. However, when it comes to the testing stage, the second prompt also attends to the first one in the concatenation, with the simultaneous change of the position-ids sequence1 .\nTo fill this gap, Tailor introduces a Multi-Attribute Prompt mask (MAP mask) and a Reindexing Position-ids sequence (RP sequence) for the fixed GPT-2. MAP mask prevents distinct single-attribute prompts from cross-attention, and RP sequence ensures stable position-ids information for the PLM after swapping, by individually numbering each prompt. As such non-training method partly addresses the issue, the text fluency still decrease, since there is no multi-attribute specific training stage for these single-attribute prompts to adapt to work together. Inspired by the role of 'and' in connecting parallel phrases for natural sentences (Rudolph, 1989) , Tailor further provides a training method that contains a continuous connector to connect two single-attribute prompts as a whole to multi-attribute CTG.",
        "At each temporal instant, the human brain dynamically responds to visual stimuli conveyed through ocular reception [38] , which can be indirectly quantified using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Identifying and categorizing distinct patterns of brain activity in reaction to visual stimuli is a crucial step in comprehending the enigma of the human brain. A significant approach to accomplish this is by inverse modeling, i.e., reconstructing the observed image from the fMRI signal [29, 19] . Due to the intricate nature of images, the acquisition of pixel-level information poses challenges and is not invariably imperative. Consequently, researchers have primarily focused on decoding the semantic essence of images [19, 35, 2, 10] . Conversely, fMRI encoding endeavors to predict the fMRI signal from visual stimuli. Generally, the fMRI signal presents various inherent challenges: (1) Redundancy: Semantic information within the signal is sparsely distributed, with neighboring elements demonstrating high correlation, indicating redundant behavior of the fMRI signal [5] . (2) Instability: The fMRI signal undergoes substantial influence from domain shifts, signifying that signals obtained from one individual or scanner may not be applicable for decoding fMRI signals from another individual or scanner [6] . (3) Insufficiency: In practical scenarios, the availability of image-signal pairs is limited, making it challenging to deploy prevalent deep learning methods that heavily rely on large training sets for fMRI comprehension. Recent works [27, 9, 6, 21, 8, 28] attempted to decode fMRI signals based on pre-trained generative models like Instance-Conditional GAN [3] , diffusion models [17] , masked autoencoders [14] , CLIP [31] , to name a few. Despite achieving impressive results in high-fidelity generation, these methods encounter several inherent challenges: (1) while pre-trained generative models prove advantageous in generating images of exceptional quality, ensuring semantic consistency with fMRI signals remains a persistent challenge. (2) These models demonstrate the ability to generate high-quality images even when presented with random noise masquerading as fake fMRI signals, thereby raising concerns regarding their reliability, particularly in the context of open-vocabulary visual stimuli. Furthermore, only a handful of methodologies jointly addressing fMRI decoding and encoding tasks.\nIn this paper, we present a pioneering framework that tackles the challenges of fMRI signals through the joint tasks of fMRI decoding and encoding. Our framework has several key components. (1) First, we introduce an encoder-decoder architecture designed specifically for fMRI signals and images. By utilizing this architecture, we effectively learn a dense and compact latent representation space for each modality. This approach directly addresses the issue of signal redundancy in fMRI data, offering promising solutions. (2) Additionally, our framework demonstrates the advantage of training the encoder-decoder architectures independently for fMRI signals and images. This eliminates the necessity of paired fMRI-image data, thereby circumventing the insufficiency problem associated with such datasets. Our method provides a practical solution that overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches. (3) Despite the inherent instability of fMRI signals across different individuals, our framework successfully compresses these signals into a unified latent representation space using a shared encoder. (4) Inspired by the principles of self-supervised training [41, 15, 14] , we leverage this methodology to train our encoder-decoder architecture.",
        "Semantic textual similarity (STS) and information retrieval tasks (IR) have been two principle measures to record the progress of dense representation models (Agirre et al., 2013; 2014; 2015; 2016; Cer et al., 2017; Thakur et al., 2021) . Despite still heavily being evaluated in sentence representation research, STS is known for its limited alignment with real-world use cases (Neelakantan et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2023b) , ambiguity (Deshpande et al., 2023) , and performance orthogonality with IR and other downstream tasks (Reimers et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2023a) .\nIn the LLM era, Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Neelakantan et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023) has become a go-to alternative method to vanilla end-toend generative language models (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) . This shift is motivated by the inherent weaknesses of LLMs towards factual errors, due to hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023) , knowledge outdatedness (Vu et al., 2023) , rarity in long-tailed knowledge (Kandpal et al., 2023; Malaviya et al., 2023) , and reasoning failure such as on logical deduction (Berglund et al., 2023) .\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is employed differently across various NLP tasks:\n\u2022 For knowledge-intensive tasks, RAG is employed to retrieve the most up-to-date and reliable knowledge references (Vu et al., 2023; Malaviya et al., 2023) , serving as new prompts for LLMs to extract information and formulate responses. This method mitigates models' natural tendencies to hallucinate (Ji et al., 2023) and reduces the need for frequent fine-tuning of LLMs.\n\u2022 In reasoning-dependent tasks, RAG aims to fetch the most relevant chunks from extensive inputs to guide the focus of LLMs, e.g., in multi-hop question answering scenarios where reasoning across chunks from multiple documents is required. Reasoning with such long context is not only impossible for LLMs with built-in short context windows, but also challenging for LLMs with long context capabilities (Xu et al., 2023) .\nDespite the promise shown by dense retrievers in fetching references for knowledge-intensive tasks, these systems still fall short in retrieving reliable and cite-worthy references (Malaviya et al., 2023) , compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs (OpenAI, 2023) in a standalone manner, highlighting the undesirable behavior of retrievers in assisting LLMs. This discrepancy is more pronounced in reasoning-intensive tasks, where retrieval-augmented generation methods present inconsistent gains, or even performance degradation to LLMs (Bai et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023) .",
        "Periodic behaviors emerge quite often in the dynamical analysis of systems. Their importance is even greater when dealing with complex and realistic models portraying natural phenomena, such as, e.g., the evolution of epidemics or population dynamics. Some form of delay is usually intrinsic in their description, and this is definitely the case we are focused in.\nWhile the subject of periodic solutions is well settled for ordinary differential equations as far as computation, continuation and bifurcation are considered (see, e.g., the package MatCont [2] as a representative of the state-of-the-art), relevant theory and computational tools have not yet reached a full maturity for delay equations. Among the main references for delay differential equations is DDE-Biftool [1, 22] , where the computation of periodic solutions is based on the work [20] , extending the classic piecewise orthogonal collation methods already used for the case of ordinary differential equations (see, e.g., [4, 5] ). But when it comes to dealing with more complicated systems, involving also renewal or Volterra integral and integro-differential equations, the lack is evident [12, 13] .\nThe present work was originally guided by the need to fill this gap, trying to extend the numerical collocation [20] to Renewal Equations (REs). Besides the basic aspects concerning implementation and computation, effort was initially devoted to providing sources from the literature for the analysis of the error and the relevant convergence. In realizing that even these sources are lacking or at least not general (see Section 1.2 below), we decided to tackle a full investigation starting from the basic case of Retarded Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs), mainly inspired by the recent \"trilogy\" of papers [29, 30, 31] , which deals with the numerical solution of Boundary Value Problems (BVPs).\nThe outcome, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first rigorous and fullydetailed analysis of error and convergence of piecewise collocation methods for the computation of periodic solutions of general RFDEs. Let us anticipate that the proposed approach is based on collocating the derivative of the solution following [31] and in view of extension to REs as discussed in Section 2.2.\nIn this introduction we start in Section 1.1 by deriving two equivalent BVP formulations for general RFDEs in view of computing periodic solutions. A discussion of the relevant literature is presented in Section 1.2. Aims, contributions and results of the analysis we propose are summarized in Section 1.3. Finally, some notations on relevant function spaces are introduced and suitably discussed in Section 1.4.\nThe rest of the paper is organized in three main parts, namely Section 2, dealing with the validation of the required theoretical assumptions; Section 3 presenting the discretization and validating the required numerical assumptions; Section 4 concerning the final convergence analysis.",
        "Video prediction in computer vision is to estimate upcoming future frames at pixel-level from given previous frames. Since predicting the future is an important base-* Corresponding author \u2020 https://github.com/sangmin-git/LMC-Memory ment for intelligent decision-making systems, the video prediction has attracted increasing attention in industry and research fields. It has the potential to be applied to various tasks such as weather forecasting [40] , traffic situation prediction [5] , and autonomous driving [4] . However, the pixel-level video prediction is still challenging mainly due to the difficulties of capturing high-dimensionality and long-term motion dynamics [11, 33, 34, 36] .\nRecently, several studies with deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed to capture the highdimensionality and the long-term dynamics of video data in the video prediction field [7, 11, 29, [33] [34] [35] [36] . The models considering the high-dimensionality of videos tried to simplify the problem by constraining motion and disentangling components [7, 11, 33] . However, these methods did not consider the long-term frame dynamics, which leads to predicting blurry frames or wrong motion trajectories. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been developed to capture the long-term dynamics with consideration for longterm dependencies in the video prediction [34] [35] [36] . The long-term dependencies in the RNNs is about remembering past step inputs. The RNN-based methods exploited the memory cell states in the RNN unit. The cell states are recurrently changed according to the current input sequence to remember the previous steps of the sequence. However, it is difficult to capture the long-term motion dynamics for the input sequence with limited dynamics (i.e., short-term motion) because such cell states mainly depend on revealing relations within the current input sequence. For example, given short-length input frames for a walking motion, the leg movement from the input is limited itself. Therefore, it is difficult to grasp what will happen to the leg in the future through the cell states of the RNNs. In this case, the long-term motion context of the partial action may not be properly captured by the RNN-based methods.\nOur work addresses long-term motion context issues for predicting future frames, which have not been properly dealt with in previous video prediction works. To predict the future precisely, it is required to capture which long-term motion context the input motion belongs to. For example, in order to predict the future of leg movement, we need to know such partial leg movement belongs to either walking or running (i.e., long-term motion context). The bottlenecks arising when dealing with long-term motion context are as follows: (i) how to predict the long-term motion context naturally matching input sequences with limited dynamics, (ii) how to predict the long-term motion context with high-dimensionality.",
        "Since the 1980s, we have known that it is possible to substantially reduce parameters in neural networks without seriously compromising performance [16, 31] . Such pruned neural networks can significantly decrease the computational demands of inference by using specific methods [8, 14] . Among the various pruning methods developed so far, Network Pruning at Initialization (PaI) has attracted considerable attention since it provides a possibility to train sparse networks at lower costs [38] . Specifically, PaI aims to achieve (close to) full accuracy (the accuracy reached by the dense network) by training a sparse subnetwork from a randomly initialized dense network.\nIn PaI research, the pruning criterion is the key focus [11, 21, 26, 28, 29, 35, 38] . Most PaI works involve iterative pruning processing to improve performance while drastically increasing training costs. In contrast, One-shot Network Pruning at Initialization (OPaI), another branch of PaI, attempts to reduce costs by single-step pruning. Specifically, SNIP [22] and GraSP [37] , two representative methods of OPaI, use gradient information in the initial network to find subnetworks. Both algorithms employ random mini-batches in the pruning step, however, the data's role has not been elucidated. Furthermore, despite the lack of extensive experimental evidence, there is a growing belief that data is not essential in OPaI [12, 19, 32] , which may impact future OPaI or even PaI research.\nThis work questions the presumption of data independence in OPaI. To find the answer, we present Discriminative One-shot Network Pruning (DOP), as shown in Fig. 1 . Compared to previous studies, we employ discriminative data rather than random mini-batches. As a result, more precise gradient information is retained, so crucial structures and parameters are preserved in the network.",
        "Logical reasoning is one of the most important and longstanding problems in artificial intelligence (Russell and Norvig, 2010) . A logical reasoning system is able to draw new facts by applying known rules to known facts and determine the truth value of a given hypothesis; see Figure 1 for an example. For decades, research in building reasoning systems has heavily relied on formal logic. Since the surge of pretrained large language models (LMs), there have been efforts that harness the power of pretrained LMs and directly handle natural language statements to perform multi-step logical reasoning; see section 5 for a summary. In this paper, we propose LEAP, the first LM-based logical reasoning system that performs explicit planning during inference. While determining the truth value of a statement, our system searches over the known facts for those which are relevant and performs multiple rounds of deduction to reach the conclusion. At each round, the planning process looks ahead into the future outcomes of each possible reasoning decision (i.e., which to select and what to deduce), examining which of them is more likely to discover a valid proof for the given statement.\nWhy planning? Planning is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior: it uses foresight to anticipate future outcomes of each possible decision and informs the process of decision making to achieve desirable end results. This concept has influenced the development of various methods in the field of artificial intelligence. Minimax-style game playing evaluates each possible move by anticipating replies and counterreplies between the player and the opponent (while assuming that both play optimally) (Russell and Norvig, 2010) . Model-based reinforcement learning uses environment models to simulate responses to actions and then uses the simulated experiences to help learn value functions (e.g., Dyna, Monte-Carlo tree search) (Sutton and Barto, 2018) . In natural language processing, planning has been used to help language models generate utterances that satisfy complex constraints (Lu et al., 2022a) .\nPlanning is important for logical reasoning. By examining the future outcomes of each possible decision, a planning-based system will be able to focus on the actually useful (given and deduced) facts at early steps, thus enjoying a high chance of success. In addition, a planning-based reasoning system tends to be more interpretable, thus more useful in user-centric and safetycritical scenarios.",
        "Recent years have witnessed increasing popularity in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) given their notable performance in following instructions, answering questions, and in many reasoning tasks, serving as general-purpose assistants (Huang and Chang, 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) . In parallel, a new generation of powerful Vision and Language LLMs (VLLMs) with excellent visual understanding and generation capabilities have emerged (Gan et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a) . Rapidly, these models have outperformed previous approaches in many downstream tasks. In our work, we focus on the Natural Language Generation skills of powerful VLLMs by analyzing an important but under-explored problem, namely, their ability to capture human production variability (in terms of distribution over plausible labels/descriptions) in naming tasks.\nPrevious work highlighted that speakers display a wide range of variability when asked to utter sentences, resulting in inter-speaker variability but also variability over time for the same speaker (Levelt, 1993; Fan et al., 2018; Alva-Manchego et al., 2021; Takmaz et al., 2024) . In particular, in object naming, speakers may refer to objects appearing in a visual scene in many different ways (Graf et al., 2016) . Objects generally belong to multiple categories/super-categories, and all the lexicalized labels of such categories are valid (Brown, 1958) . However, although multiple labels are valid, humans pragmatically adapt their naming preferences depending on the context (Olson, 1970; Rohde et al., 2012) , resulting in some labels being more frequently uttered than others. For instance, 'mammal' is a correct label to describe a Gold Retriever, but pragmatically less likely than 'dog'. Similarly, speakers tend to prefer sub-ordinate words like 'car' instead of the potentially ambiguous super-ordinate word 'vehicle' in case multiple vehicles appear in the image. In our work, we are interested in capturing both these two features: while many labels are equally valid and acceptable when naming or describing entities, these labels distribute according to a certain likelihood distribution.\nIn our work, we investigate this issue in three different production conditions. First of all, we consider the ManyNames dataset (Silberer et al., 2020a,b) , where annotators assign labels to describe common objects in images in a referential expression generation setting (Yu et al., 2016; Kazemzadeh et al., 2014) .",
        "Minimal problems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] , which we study, are 3D reconstruction problems recovering camera poses and world coordinates from given images such that random input instances have a finite positive number of solutions. They are important basic computational tasks in 3D reconstruction from images [24, 25, 26] , image matching [27] , visual odometry and localization [28, 29, 30, 31] . Recently, a complete characterization of minimal problems for points, lines and their incidences in calibrated multi-view geometry appeared for the case of complete multi-view visibility [32] . In this paper, we extend the characterization to an important class of problems under partial multi-view visibility. Contribution. We provide a complete classification of minimal problems for generic arrangements of points and lines in space observed partially by three calibrated perspective cameras when each line is incident to at most one point. There is an infinite number of such minimal problems; however, we show that they can be reduced to 140616 equivalence classes of reduced minimal problems by removing superfluous features and relabeling the cameras. We compute a full description of each class in terms of the incidence structure in 3D and visibility of each 3D feature in images. All problems in every equivalence class have the same algebraic degree, i.e. the number of solutions over the complex numbers.\nWhen using minimal solvers to find correct image matches by RANSAC [33, 34] , we often aim to recover camera parameters only. We name such reconstruction problems camera-minimal and reserve \"minimal\" for when we aim to recover 3D structure as well. Note that minimal problems are also cameraminimal but not vice versa. For instance, 50 out of the 66 problems given in [35] are non-minimal yet they all are camera-minimal. As an example, consider the problem from [35] with 3 PPP and 1 PPL correspondences. It is camera-minimal, i.e. there are 272 (in general complex) camera solutions, but it is not minimal since the line of the PPL correspondence cannot be recovered uniquely in 3D: there is a one-dimensional pencil of lines in 3D that project to the observed line in one of the images.\nFor each minimal problem, we delete additional superfluous features in images that can be removed without loosing camera-minimality in order to obtain a simplest camera-minimal problem. Thus, we introduce terminal camera-minimal problems. We show that, up to relabeling cameras, there are 74575 of these. They form the comprehensive list worth studying, since a solver for any cameraminimal problem can be derived from a solver for some problem on this list. Only 76 of the 74575 terminal camera-minimal problems were known -the 66 problems listed in [35] plus 10 additional cases from [32] -the remaining 74499, to the best of our knowledge, are new! We find all terminal camera-minimal problems with less than 300 solutions for generic data and present other interesting cases that might be important for practical solving of image matching and 3D reconstruction.\nCharacterizing minimal problems under partial visibility, which allows for missing observations in images due to occlusions and missed detections, is very hard. Previous results in [32] treat the case of full visibility with no restrictions on the number of cameras and types of incidences, resulting in 30 minimal problems. By contrast, we construct a long list of interesting problems under partial visibility, even with our restrictions, i.e. having exactly three cameras and having each line incident to at most one point 1 .",
        "Research in control theory is often concerned with stability without regarding the transient behaviour of a system. However, in industry this aspect is very important: a stable system with big transient errors or a very long settling time is obviously undesirable and very likely to be put aside by engineers. PID has enjoyed much success in industry not only because it is relatively simple, but also because the design often addresses performance specifications, such as rise-time, settling-time, over-shoot and steady-state error, see [37] . However, one of PID's shortcomings is the fact that it does not explicitly take constraints and performance requirements into account, resulting in engineers often resorting to their experience and trial-and-error.\nThe problem of designing control systems capable of shaping transient performance has received the attention of a number of researchers, and we present a summary of the problem's history. Typical adaptive control schemes are plagued by unacceptable transients and it is in this field that, to our knowledge, one of the first papers on shaping a system's transient response according to explicit performance specifications, see [32] , was produced. Concentrating on single-input single-output (SISO) systems that are minimum phase, the authors approach the problem by dynamically adjusting the controller's feedback gains. Other works in adaptive control that are concerned with transient performance usually present results in the form of guaranteed bounds on the evolution of the state, output, or control signals, see for example [38, 33] . Note, however, that these works do not consider the derivation of control laws such that explicit performance requirements are satisfied.\nFunnel control, introduced in [23] , approaches the problem by specifying time-varying constraints (the \"funnel\") on the output and letting the control magnitude be dependent on the distance of the output to the funnel boundary. The theory is applicable to a great diversity of dynamical systems of known relative degree that satisfy a \"high frequency gain condition\", and which have the same number of inputs as outputs. Later works, see [20, 19] , consider constrained inputs in the formulation; and [30] considers a bang-bang implementation. Funnel control has found application in many fields, see for example [34, 16, 17] . The reader may also refer to the references [18, 21, 22] .\nAnother approach to shaping transients is presented in [1] and [2] for feedback linearisable nonlinear systems, and systems in strict-feedback, respectively. The authors specify performance requirements through time-varying constraints on the state and introduce a transformation that recasts this problem into an unconstrained one, the stability of which leads to a solution of the original performance problem. Though the method is applicable to unknown nonlinear systems with mild assumptions, one still needs to solve a new stabilisation problem. More recently, the paper [3] introduces a similar, but simpler, idea to systems in pure feedback form.",
        "E NERGY communities are regarded as a solution that im- proves system efficiency, economies of scale, and equity while enabling distributed energy resources (DER) aggregation and wider technology accessibility [1] - [3] . A generic energy community is illustrated in Fig. 1 , where a coalition of a group of customers pool and aggregate their resources within the community and perform energy and monetary transactions with the utility company as a single entity behind a point of common coupling (PCC) downstream of the utility revenue meter [3] . Under the widely adopted NEM policy, the utility revenue meter measures the community's net consumption and assigns a buy (retail) rate if the community is net importing, and a sell (export) rate if the community is net exporting [4] . Several utilities have initiated energy-community-enabling programs, such as NEM aggregation (NEMA) 1 , for university campuses, residential complexes, and medical cities.\nWe focus in this work on the pricing mechanism that determines each community member's payment based on her consumption, individual-owned renewable, and her share of the community-owned DER. We set the underlying pricing principle as maximizing community social welfare while ensuring that each member gains higher benefits than possible outside the community.",
        "Topic models have been a fundamental and prevalent research area for decades, aiming to discover latent topics from a document collection and infer topic distributions of documents (Churchill and Singh, 2022) . Various topic modeling scenarios have been explored, e.g., hierarchical, dynamic, and cross-lingual topic modeling (Griffiths et al., 2003; Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Mimno et al., 2009) . Current topic models can be categorized into two types: (1) conventional topic models employing probabilistic graphical models (Blei et al., 2003) or non-negative matrix factorization (Lee and Seung, 2000) and (2) recently popular neural topic models (Zhao et al., 2021a) . Due to their effectiveness and interpretability, topic models have inspired various downstream tasks and applications (Boyd-Graber et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2023c) . However, despite these significant achievements, quick utilization and fair comparisons of various topic models remain a formidable challenge. The challenge lies in their unsystematic model implementations as well as inconsistent dataset and evaluation settings across papers, even within a paper (Hoyle et al., 2021) .\nIn response to this challenge, several topic modeling toolkits are proposed, but they commonly exhibit incompleteness. Early toolkits (McCallum, 2002; Qiang et al., 2020; Lisena et al., 2020) often lack necessary steps in the modeling lifecycle (e.g., pre-processing and comprehensive evaluations), critical topic modeling scenarios, or recent neural topic models. The latest toolkit is OCTIS (Terragni et al., 2021) which integrates more features, but it solely considers basic and hierarchical topic modeling and lacks the latest neural topic models (It has only two neural topic models after 2018). These issues pose hurdles to the evaluations, comparisons, applications, and developments of topic models.\nTo address these issues, we in this paper propose TopMost, a Topic Modeling System Toolkit. In contrast to existing toolkits, TopMost comprehensively includes the most popular topic modeling scenarios: basic, hierarchical, dynamic, and cross-lingual topic modeling. It covers the entire lifecycles of these scenarios with datasets, pre-processing, model training, testing, and evaluations.",
        "The Bi-encoder (Karpukhin et al., 2020) is a type of neural network architecture that is widely used in information retrieval. It consists of two encoders, typically in the form of transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) , which encode an vector representation for user queries and potential documents or passages respectively. These two encoders can be shared or using two separate models. The similarity between these two embedding vectors can then be computed, often using dot product or cosine similarity, to determine the relevance of the document or passage to the user's query.\nCross-encoders (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) , unlike bi-encoders, amalgamate the inputs at an early stage, allowing for a more intricate interaction between user queries and documents. Here the user query and the document are concatenated, based on which a joint embedding vector is computed. The joint embedding vector is then used to make predictions, such as the relevance of a document to a query in an information retrieval task. Crossencoders often outperform bi-encoders in tasks re-Figure 1 : Overall view on LLM-augmented retrieval framework. Synthetic relevant queries and synthetic titles are generated from LLM and then assembled into doc-level embedding together with chunks (passages) split from the original document. The final retrieval is based on the similarity between user query and the doc-level embedding.\nquiring a nuanced understanding of the interplay between inputs.\nLate-interaction models, such as ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020), ColBERTv2 (Santhanam et al., 2021) or SPALDE++ (Formal et al., 2022) , are model architectures that hybrids crossencoder models and bi-encoder models. Queries and documents are independently encoded into token-level vector representations. So in some sense, this is a bag of embedding vectors model. The interaction between these representations, which constitutes the \"late interaction\", involves computing the cosine similarity or dot product scores over the token-level vector embedding.\nAll the model architectures require informative embedding of user queries and target documents.",
        "The world is seeing a paradigm shift the way we conduct our daily activities amidst ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic -be it online learning, the way we socialize, interact, conduct businesses or do shopping. Such global catastrophes have a direct effect on our social life; however, not all cultures react and respond in the same way given a crisis. Even under normal circumstances, research suggests that people across different cultures reason differently [1] . For instance, Nisbett in his book \"The geography of thought: How Asians and Westerners think differently... and why\" stated that the East Asians think on the basis of their experience dialectically and holistically, while Westerners think logically, abstractly, and analytically [2] . This cultural behavior and attitude are mostly governed by many factors, including the socio-economic situation of a country, faith and belief system, and lifestyle. In fact, the COVID-19 crisis showed greater cultural differences between countries that seem alike with respect to language, shared history and culture. For example, even though Denmark and Sweden are two neighboring countries that speak almost the same language and share a lot of culture and history, they stand at extreme ends of the spectrum when it comes to the way how they reacted to coronavirus [3] .",
        "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a relatively common lifethreatening disease (25 per 100,000 people per year) that may develop after physical trauma or non-traumatically. The significance of this event is given by a high 30-days mortality rate (up to 52 %) and a large risk of lasting consequences among survivors [1] . For these reasons, the fast discovery of the disease is crucial for the early initiation of treatment. If the diagnosis of the disease is delayed (within minutes), it increases the risk of permanent brain dis-function, or it can be even fatal. Modern brain CT analysing computer systems can provide fast and effective support for computer-aided diagnosis and can therefore be very useful for physicians' decisions, especially in acute cases.\nNowadays, most state-of-the-art methods are focused on deep learning approaches, especially using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and their modifications or combinations. Published detection algorithms [2] and [3] use 3D CNN-based classification on the patient level that provide a decision about the presence of ICHs in patient scans. A combination of 2D CNN and LSTM (Long short-term memory) algorithm for ICH detection in CT slices was designed by the authors of [4] . Another combination of CNN and recurrent neural network was published in [5] that includes classification into its sub-types.\nThe algorithm for 2D ICH segmentation including its type classification based on cascade CNN model was applied by the authors of [6] . For the same task, the authors of [7] suggested a hybrid 2D/3D approach using Mask Regional-CNN algorithm. The well-known U-net architecture of CNN has been used in [8] for 2D ICH segmentation. A similar 3D approach was introduced by the authors of [9] .\nOne of the first published mentions of the possible utilizing of attention maps for ICH detection or segmentation is in nemcek@vut.cz [10] . Here, the authors cursorily validated the ICHs center detection via plain thresholding of the attention maps (as an appendix of their manuscript). In [5] , the attention maps were displayed for mere visualization of the network field of view.\nThe presented approach of ICH localization is based on the detection of local extrema in attention maps, which can be understood as the likelihood of ICH occurrence for each pixel. These maps are produced by the proposed weakly supervised approach based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) [11] . Its advantage is a position-free learning, thus precise position annotations are not needed for training, and slice-level annotations (healthy/ICH) are quite sufficient.",
        "Autonomous driving has been one of the most anticipated technologies since the advent of modern-day artificial intelligence. However, even after decades of exploration, we have yet to see self-driving cars deployed at scale. One main reason is the generalization. The world and its drivers are more diverse than current planning approaches can handle. Hand-designed classical planning [3, 16, 29, 45] does not generalize gracefully to unseen or unfamiliar scenarios. Learning based methods [4, 9, 11, 14, 37] fare better, but suffer from a long tail of driving scenarios. The majority of driving data consist of easy and uninteresting behaviors. After all, humans drive thousands of hours before observing a traffic accident [43] , especially when driving an expensive autonomous test vehicle. How do we tame the long-tail of driving scenes? While many approaches rely on carefully crafted safety-critical scenarios in simulation [33, 36, 42] , or collect massive data in the real world [4, 41] , in this paper we focus on an orthogonal direction.\nWe observe that, although many of us have not experienced traffic accidents ourselves, everyone has at least observed several accidents throughout our driving career. The Figure 1 . We present LAV, a mapless, learning-based end-to-end driving system. LAV takes as input multi-modal sensor readings and learns from all nearby vehicles in the scene for both perception and planning. At test time, LAV predicts multi-modal future trajectories for all detected vehicles, including the ego-vehicle. Picture credit -Waymo open dataset [41] .\nsame applies to safety-critical driving scenarios: While the data-collecting ego-vehicle might not experience accidentprone situations itself, it is likely its driving logs contain states that are interesting or safety-critical, but experienced by other vehicles. Training on other vehicles' trajectories helps not only with sample efficiency, but also greatly increase the chance that the model sees interesting scenarios. Moreover, knowing other vehicles' future trajectories helps the ego-vehicle avoid collisions.\nThe main challenge with training on all vehicles lies in the partial observability of other vehicles. Unlike the egovehicle, other vehicles have only partially observed motion trajectories, exposing no control commands or higher-level goals.",
        "Motion planning consists of finding a state trajectory and associated inputs that connect the initial and final state sets while satisfying the dynamics of the systems and given safety requirements. Motion planning for purely continuoustime systems and purely discrete-time systems has been well studied in the literature; see e.g., [1] . In recent years, several (feasible) motion planning algorithms have been developed, including graph search algorithms [2] , artificial potential field methods [3] and sampling-based algorithms. The samplingbased algorithms have drawn much attention in recent years because of their fast exploration speed for high dimensional problems and theoretical guarantees; specially, probabilistic completeness, which means that the probability of failing to find a motion plan converges to zero, as the number of samples approaches infinity. Two popular sampling-based algorithms are the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm [4] and the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm [5] . The PRM method relies on the existence of a steering function returning the solution of a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP). Unfortunately, solutions to TPBVPs are difficult to generate for most dynamical systems. On the other hand, RRT algorithm does not require a steering function. Arguably, RRT is perhaps the most successful algorithm to solve feasible motion planning problems.\nA feasible solution is not sufficient in most applications as the quality of the solution returned by the motion planning algorithms is key [6] . It has been shown in [7] that the solution returned by RRT converges to a sub-optimal solution. Therefore, variants of PRM and RRT, such as PRM* and RRT* [8] , have been developed to solve optimal motion planning problems with guaranteed asymptotic optimality. However, both PRM* and RRT* require a steering function, which prevents them from being widely applied. On the other hand, the stable sparse RRT (SST) algorithm [9] does not require a steering function and is guaranteed to be asymptotically near optimal, which means that the probability of finding a solution that has a cost close to the minimal cost converges to one as the number of iterations goes to infinity.",
        "Transformer-based encoder-decoder models have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020) , including Neural Machine Translation (NMT) (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sennrich et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017) . However, the autoregressive decoding process often imposes a significant computational burden, especially as the number of layers and parameters escalates with increasing model complexity. This presents substantial challenges when deploying the Transformer-based models for real-time applications (Gu et al., 2017) and online services (Zhou et al., 2022) .\nOne of the possible solutions is to reduce the model size using knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015) . KD facilitates the transfer of knowledge from a high-performing, largeparameter teacher model to a more moderately sized student model. This process alleviates deployment challenges by generating a distilled model that is both lightweight and efficient, ensuring reduced inference times and lower computational resource requirements. Furthermore, with the guidance of the teacher model, the student model can potentially achieve performance levels closer to those of the teacher model compared to training it without the teacher's assistance.\nKD, initially proposed by Bucila et al.; Ba and Caruana; Hinton et al., involves transferring knowledge to the student model using responses from the network's last layer. Among its variants, Sequencelevel KD (Kim and Rush, 2016) and Selective KD (Wang et al., 2021) leverage the final output and soft labels from teacher's responses, respectively. These strategies can be categorized as response-based KD (Gou et al., 2021) . Meanwhile, not only the final layer outputs are used, but intermediate features from the teacher model's layer are also used as a medium for a more effective and comprehensive distillation of knowledge (Romero et al., 2015; Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2017; Sun et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) . These approaches belong to the category of feature-based KD (Gou et al., 2021) . Most feature-based KD in Transformers has concentrated on compressing encoder-based models (Sanh et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Passban et al., 2021) , including pre-trained models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) . On the other hand, some studies (Wu et al., 2020; Shleifer and Rush, 2020) have applied feature-based KD to the decoder for generative tasks. However, they found it less effective compared to response-based KD for decoder distillation (Kim and Rush, 2016;  arXiv:2403.01479v3 [cs.CL] 25 Mar 2024 Kasai et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) .\nWhile extending KD to features across the layers does enrich knowledge transfer, it prompts an open question: 'From which teacher layer should the student layer learn and from which should it not?'. Instead of resolving this issue through trainable methods, several studies (Sun et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Passban et al., 2021) have circumvented the issue using heuristic approaches. Those approaches require a heuristic skip or combination of teacher layers to align with the student layer. However, as the number of layers increases, the complexity of heuristically selecting features grows, necessitating an exhaustive search for the optimal combination strategy. For example, Combinatorial KD (Wu et al., 2020) demonstrated that its peak performance relies on language-pairspecific feature mapping.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel KD strategy, Align-to-Distill (A2D), that addresses the feature mapping problem using a trainable Attention Alignment Module (AAM). Unlike earlier KD methods that relied on combinatorial feature mapping heuristics, A2D provides an end-to-end trainable solution. The adaptive alignment of features removes the necessity for a data-dependent mapping strategy. Furthermore, AAM aligns the student attention map in each head with those of the teacher, resulting in more effective distillation compared to layerwise feature mapping. AAM enables each attention head in the student model to be compared with every head in the teacher model across different layers, by employing pointwise convolution with only a few additional parameters. As a result, there is no longer a need for head or layer parity between the student and teacher models.\nNotably, our experimental results and analysis show that due to its fine-grained attention transfer in a head-wise manner, A2D is effectively applicable to the decoder of the Transformer, an area where previous feature-based KD approaches have typically struggled.",
        "In this paper, we consider embeddings of graphs where the vertices are mapped to points in R d , for d \u2265 3, and the edges are represented by line-segments on the d 2 axis-parallel planes. For example, a 3-dimensional network may be visualized by placing it inside a cube and drawing the edges on the walls of the cube by projecting the points.\nOne motivation is the connection to two classical parameters, thickness and geometric thickness. The thickness of a graph G, is the smallest number of planar subgraphs into which the edges of G can be decomposed. This was introduced by Tutte in [18] ; see also [16] for a survey of thickness. Geometric thickness adds the restriction that all the subgraphs must be embedded simultaneously, that is, with a common embedding of the vertices. This was studied in [4] for complete graphs. The connection between geometric thickness and parameters such as maximum degree and tree-width has been studied in various papers: [8] , [2] , [7] . While using the standard co-ordinate planes in high dimensions is more restrictive than thickness, it appears to be less so than geometric thickness (Section 3).\nBook embeddings, defined by Ollmann in [17] , are restrictinos of geometric drawings in which the vertices are in convex position. The book thickness of G is the smallest number of subgraphs that cover all the edges of G in such a drawing. This is also known as stack number, and is studied in [6] . Also see [5] for a survey.\nMore generally, a survey on simultaneous embedding of graphs may be found in [3] .\nIn [14] , the authors showed that n-vertex graphs of geometric thickness 2 can have at most 6n -18 edges. Such graphs can also be represented as projections in two orthogonal planes; orthogonal planes appear to allow a greater degree of freedom, as we give a construction of graphs with 6n -15 edges.",
        "Transformer-based architectures such as BERT have recently lead to breakthroughs in a variety of language-related tasks, such as document classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and various forms of text-mining (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019; Adhikari et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020) . These models create semantic representations of text, which can subsequently be used in many downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019) . The training process for Transformers typically includes two phases: During pre-training, the model learns to extract semantic representations from large, taskindependent corpora. The pre-training is followed by task-specific fine-tuning on a separate dataset to optimize model performance further.\nIn this paper, we study the effects of fine-tuning Transformer-based architectures in a federated learning (FL) setting. In FL, models are trained in a decentralized fashion on a number of local compute instances, called clients, and intermittently aggregated and synchronized via a central server. As such, FL is a solution for distributed compute, as well as distributed data, and provides a level of privacy with regards to the sharing of personal or otherwise sensitive data. Model aggregation is commonly performed via averaging of the weights of the individual client models, called Federated Averaging (FEDAVG) (McMahan et al., 2017a) .\nDepending on the application, the number of clients in an FL setting can differ wildly. In instances where smartphones are used as clients, their number can reach into the millions (Hard et al., 2018) , whereas settings with higher compute requirements and more data per client will often range between a handful and a few dozens of clients. Here, we focus on the latter, as training large language models requires a lot of compute. A potential application of this is the medical field, in which automated analyses of electronic health records yield enormous potential for diagnostics and treatment-related insights (Zeng et al., 2018) .\nOur contribution: We provide a comprehensive overview of the applicability of the federated learning setting to large language models. To this end, we work with a fixed computation budget for each task, and use a fixed total amount of data while varying the number of clients between which the data is split up. This way, we isolate the effects of distributing data over several clients for distributed compute. We leave comparisons with a fixed amount of data per client and varying noni.i.d.",
        "Old Master paintings are often the subject of detailed technical examination, whether to investigate an artist's materials and technique or in support of conservation or restoration treatments. In recent years, the technical examination of paintings has undergone a major digital revolution, with the widespread adoption of cutting-edge analytical and imaging technologies, generating large and typically multi-dimensional datasets [1] - [3] .\nWhile they have a long history of use, traditional Xradiographs (X-ray images) still play a vital role in informing the technical study, conservation, and preservation of artworks in cultural heritage institutions due to the ability of X-rays to penetrate deep into a painting's stratigraphy [4] , [5] . They can help to establish the condition of a painting (e.g., losses and damages not apparent at the surface), the status of different paint passages (e.g., to identify retouching, fills or other conservation interventions) or provide information about the painting support (e.g., type of canvas or the construction of a canvas or panel). X-ray images also provide insight into how the artist built up the different paint layers, thus revealing pentimenti -changes made by the artist during paintingwhich may include concealed earlier designs that were painted over when the artist revised the design or if the painting support was reused by the artist. There are many such artworks with concealed paintings with research from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam showing that 20 of 130 paintings by Van Gogh, i.e., nearly 15%, contained concealed paintings [6] .\nTherefore, in order to improve the understanding of the artworks and artists' working practice, there is a lot of interest in the ability to derive clearer visualisations of such hidden designs. Some works have proposed approaches leveraging various imaging modalities to enhance visualisation of concealed images in paintings [7] , improve imaging of underdrawings [8] - [11] or help reveal overwritten texts such as those found in palimpsests. X-ray image separation approaches have been proposed in a series of works such as [14] - [18] . However, such approaches apply to double-sided painting panels where -in addition to the mixed X-ray image -one also has access to two RGB (visible) images associated with the front and back sides of the artwork.\nThe approach described in the current paper applies instead to a much more challenging scenario where one has access only to the mixed X-ray image (Fig. 1 b ) plus a single RGB image associated with the visible portion of the painting (Fig. 1 (a) ).",
        "Deep neural networks are powerful, but their large size and high computation requirements make it challenging to deploy them onto mobile/embedded devices (e.g., dash cams) or in scenarios where real-time inference is required (e.g., autonomous driving). Network compression has been widely studied to reduce memory and computational costs. Popular network compression techniques include quantization [1] , knowledge distillation [2] , and network pruning [3] , [4] . Unlike other neural network compression approaches, pruning directly removes network components. They usually take in a pre-trained model, prune, and fine-tune to regain performance. The main differences between various pruning methods lie in pruning granularity and the importance measure.\nUnstructured pruning directly removes individual parameters/connections. The resulting unstructured sparsity requires specialized software [5] and hardware [6] to achieve real acceleration of the pruned model. In contrast, structured pruning removes entire channels/filters/neurons [4] , [7] - [10] , leading to structured sparsity that can be directly utilized by generalpurpose hardware. Such pruned networks can not only reduce the storage space but also speed up the inference. In this paper, we focus on structured channel pruning.\nDifferent filter/channel pruning approaches usually differ in their importance measures. Although existing methods have achieved promising results, most of them use ad-hoc humandefined or locally computed importance measures that are not directly related to the final task utility. Moreover, few focus on the visual detection task. In this paper, we propose a gradient-based saliency measure for visual detection and use it to guide the pruning.",
        "In the rapidly evolving field of generative models, aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a paramount challenge, especially for text-to-image (T2I) models. Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in generating text that caters to a wide range of human needs, primarily through a two-stage process of pretraining on noisy web-scale datasets followed by finetuning on a smaller, preference-specific dataset. The fine-tuning process aims to align the generative model's outputs with human preferences, without significantly diminishing the capabilities gained from pretraining. Extending this fine-tuning approach to text-to-image models offers the prospect of tailoring image generation to user preferences, a goal that has remained relatively underexplored compared to its counterpart in the language domain.\nRecent works have begun to explore fine-tuning text-to-image models to better align with human preferences. These methods either use a reward model, trained using human preference data, and fine-tune the T2I model to maximize reward [9, 16, 22, 30, 35, 56] , or they directly fine-tune the T2I model on pairwise preference data [52, 57] . However, gathering paired preference data is an expensive and time-consuming process in which human annotators rank pairs of images according to their preferences. It is is difficult to collect pairwise preference data at scale, and these datasets may be noisy as preference is subjective and, thus, varies from user to user. Additionally, training a robust reward model and fine-tuning text-to-image models using a reward model can introduce significant challenges in training, add high computational overhead in terms of memory, and limit generalization. In this work, we explore fine-tuning text-toimage diffusion models using per-image binary feedback and without requiring a reward model.",
        "Fog computing is an emerging computing paradigm that promises to combine the benefits of edge computing and cloud computing [8, 31] . For low latency, application components are deployed close to or near the edge, i.e., close to end users. This can also reduce bandwidth consumption, mitigate privacy risks, and enable the edge to keep operating in the presence of network partitions. For high scalability, application components can leverage stronger machines such as cloudlets [50] within the core network [8] or run directly in the cloud. This encompassing execution environment is commonly referred to as fog [8, 9] and comprises all devices along the \"cloud-to-thing continuum\" [36] . However, even though fog computing has many advantages, there are currently only a few fog applications and \"commercial deployments are yet to take off\" [57] . Arguably, the main adoption barrier is the deployment and management of physical infrastructure, particularly at the edge, which is in stark contrast to the ease of adoption in the cloud [8] .\nIn the lifecycle of a fog application, this is not only a problem when running and operating a production system -it is also a challenge in application testing: While basic design questions can be decided using simulation, e.g., [10, 17, 20] , there comes a point when a new application needs to be tested in practice. The physical fog infrastructure, however, will typically be available for a very brief time only: in between having finished the physical deployment of devices and before going live. Before that period, the infrastructure presumably does not exist and afterwards its full capacity is used in production. Without an infrastructure to run more complex integration tests or benchmarks, e.g., for fault-tolerance in wide area deployments, however, the application developer is left with guesses, (very small) local testbeds, and simulation. While approaches for the emulation of infrastructure testbeds exist, they typically focus on emulating edge devices, e.g., [22, 44] . Other approaches also emulate infrastructure within the core network or the cloud, but they miss support for automated experiment orchestration, e.g., [12, 32] .\nIn this paper, we extend our preliminary work presented in [21] .",
        "Smart infrastructure projects, e.g., building automation, are increasingly dependent on BIM and BMS for metadata and data collection, analysis and activation components. BMS' often have the ability to monitor lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) as well as electricity consumption. Typically proprietary software, most BMS vendors provide closed system products with industrial interfaces for activation, control, and basic data visualisation without the additional contextual data from BIM. Simultaneously, considerable effort is being expended on the deployment of IoT devices to increase sensor density, but unfortunately the industry remains highly fragmented [10, 30] .\nAdditionally, legacy BMS' and much current research focuses on in-building sensor data collection, storage and presentation platforms, rarely emphasising the challenges and benefits of being able to analyse and respond to data in real-time [16, 18, 45] . BMS' have historically dealt with low-volume low-velocity data and metadata, so the adoption of IoT devices poses substantial network and system challenges in dealing with real-time data analysis, event recognition, prediction and action planning [40] .\nIn this paper we focus on the real-time aspects of spatio-temporal data available from IoT sensing. We define a real-time platform as an asynchronous system capable of processing high-volume, highheterogeneity data with minimal latency to collect, analyse, predict and adapt to changes in a timely manner.\nA real-time data architecture is only part of the puzzle though: despite the increasing deployment of IoT devices, there are still no canonical means to join BIM and deployed sensors in a single unified system. While numerous attempts exist in the form of creating ontologies (e.g., BRICK) [8, 9] to unify static metadata management for use by building automation systems, industry recognition for metadata standards is limited [10, 11, 30] . Also, as a result augmenting BIM with IoT devices, building and facility management software must be adapted [28] . Highly siloed BMS software must become able to handle an increased amount of contextual building data in a timely manner to comply with the use of edge computing to for accident and emergency management [33] and smart home initiatives resulting in the creation of safer and more resilient smart spaces [23, 46] . New approaches that combine BIM, BMS and sensor data are thus needed.\nTo meet these important challenges, we propose the Adaptive City Platform (ACP), a system for collecting, processing and visualising building information and sensor data in real-time.",
        "The data collection process of a given phenomena may be affected by different sources of variability, creating seemingly distinct domains. For instance, natural images with different illumination, contrast or noise, may affect the classification performance of a machine learning model previously trained on a different domain. In biology, the modern study of single-cell dynamics is conducted via different instruments, conditions and modalities, raising different challenges and opportunities [28, 29] . In many cases, the relationships between the different domains are unknown. Hence, the fusion and integration of multi-domain data has been extensively studied in the data science community for supervised learning as well as data mining and exploratory data analysis. One of the earliest methods to do this is Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which finds a linear projection that maximizes the correlation between the two domains [30] . CCA has been extended to different formulations in recent years as sparse CCA [20, 26] or Kernel CCA [8, 15] .\nIn many applications, a reasonable assumption to Two different datasets measured from the same underlying phenomena are captured in different conditions, instruments, experimental designs, etc. Manifold alignment assumes a common latent space (grey) from which the observations are mapped by functions f and g to the different ambient spaces. We seek to find the underlying relationship h between observations living in different spaces X and Y without assuming any pairing known a priori. Instead we assume there are labeled observations for different classes (different shapes). make is that the data collected in different domains is controlled by a set of shared underlying modes of variation or latent variables. The manifold assumption is also often applicable in this case, in which the data measured in the different domains are assumed to lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the highdimensional ambient spaces, being the result of smooth mappings of the latent variables (see Fig. 1 ). With this in mind, manifold alignment (MA) has become a common technique for data integration. Some applications of MA include handling different face poses and protein structure alignment ( [1, 37] ), medical images for Alzheimer's disease classification ( [4] , [16] ), multimodal sensing images [32] , graph-matching [13] , and integrating single-cell multi-omics data [6] .\nMultiple MA methods have been proposed under different prior knowledge assumptions that relate the two domains. Methods such as CCA or multi-view diffusion maps [23] can be categorized as supervised MA, since the data is assumed to come in a paired fashion. More challenging scenarios arise when partial or null a priori pairing knowledge is considered. Purely unsupervised algorithms are designed for scenarios where neither pairings between domains nor any other sideinformation is available. As a consequence, they rely solely on the particular topology of each domain to infer inter-domain similarities (e.g. [6, 10, 11, 34] ).\nMethods that leverage some additional information are often categorized as semi-supervised MA. As a special case, several methods consider partial correspondence information, where a few one-to-one matching samples work as anchor points to find a consistent alignment for the rest of the data. Some papers leverage the graph structure of the data [12, 18, 19, 33] and are closely related to Laplacian eigenmaps [5] . Others resort to neural networks such as the GAN-based MAGAN [2] or the autoencoder presented in [3] .\nHowever, even partial correspondences can be expensive or impossible to acquire. This is the case in biological applications where the measurement process destroys the cells, making it impossible to measure other modalities of the exact same cells. But even if there are no known correspondences between domains, we do not have to resort to unsupervised MA. If we have access to side information about the datasets from both domains, such as discrete class labels, we can leverage this extra knowledge to perform manifold alignment [31, 35, 36] . Motivated by this, we propose a new semi-supervised MA algorithm called MALI (Manifold Alignment with Label Information). MALI leverages the manifold structure of the data in both domains, combined with the discrete label information, and it does not require any known corresponding points in the different domains. MALI is built upon the widely-used manifold learning method Diffusion Maps [9] and optimal transport (OT) [27] .",
        "We are living in a world where vast amounts of data hold the power to revolutionize industries and shape the future of manufacturing. Datasets play a pivotal role in virtually every field within today's digital world, enabling data-driven decision-making. In the manufacturing industry, data-sets assume a critical position, offering invaluable insights to enhance product quality, optimize production processes, streamline supply chains, and achieve heightened operational efficiencies. However, creation of data-sets represents a laborious and timeconsuming endeavour, necessitating the acquisition of highquality, consistent, scalable, and adaptable data for process automation and optimization, particularly in the realms of robotic grasping and manipulation, assumes utmost significance.\nThe process of annotating 6D poses in data-sets for robotic grasping and manipulation represents a labour-intensive endeavour, surpassing the challenges encountered in 2D image labelling. To mitigate this challenge, a viable solution lies in the utilization of synthetic data, which offers meticulously annotated samples at a low cost for training pose estimation models [1] [2] . However, the substantial disparities between synthetic (source) and real (target) models result in suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, a promising approach emerges, combining domain randomization and photo-realistic synthetic data [3][4] , aiming to address the domain shift between the source and target domains. In our study, we adopt the real-sim-real transfer method as a means of domain adaptation to overcome sensor noise and realism issues.\nWhile certain generic data-sets, such as YCB Videos [5] , MVTech AD [6] , and Dex-Net 2.0 [7] , have been employed for training models in semantic segmentation, classification, and localization, their limitations become apparent in terms of restricted object variety and the absence of real-world manufacturing context. Consequently, our research proposes the creation of an extensive, high-fidelity data-set encompassing a range of 3D objects commonly employed within the manufacturing industry. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , we discretize the captured 3D object, acquired using a highresolution camera, into descriptive components, comprising texture, material, shape, and inertial dynamics. This process is facilitated by a customized neural network known as Disc-Net, which accepts RGBD data and CAD models of the object of interest as inputs, enabling the extraction of desired object features.",
        "Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to describe the evolution of underlying diffusion processes over time. These PDEs are applied in various fields, for instance to model dynamics in physics and chemistry (e.g., [56, 78, 99] ), to analyze some population growth in biology (e.g., [59, 62] ) to model the evolution of stock prices in finance and economics (e.g., [2, 12, 100] ), or for climate modeling (e.g., [42, 98] ), to name but a few.\nConsider the following 1 Kolmogorov PDE (see, e.g., [15, 17, 20, 28, 40, 46, 61, 77, 90, 91] )\n\uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 \u2202 t v(t, x) + \u27e8b, \u2207 x v(t, x)\u27e9 + 1 2 tr(\u03c3\u03c3 \u22a4 D 2 x v(t, x)) = 0 on [0, T ) \u00d7 R d ; v(T, x) = f (x) on R d .\n(1.1)\nOne of the common modeling challenges arising throughout all fields consists in finding the true drift and volatility parameters (b, \u03c3) to describe the underlying evolution process, which is usually unknown. Typically, one would either try to estimate the parameters using historical data or choose them based on experts' opinions. However, it is well-known that model misspecification may lead to wrong outcomes which might be fatal, as e.g., happened during the financial crisis in 2008 when financial derivatives were priced based on solutions of (1.1) but with corresponding parameters which were not consistent with the market behavior during that period.\nTo overcome this difficulty of model uncertainty, a common approach is to consider a set U of parameters (b, \u03c3), where each element (b, \u03c3) \u2208 U is considered as a candidate for the true but unknown drift and volatility.",
        "The rapid rise of online social networks (OSNs) and online social media platforms has changed the way that audiences interact with journalism, news, and each other. This shift has led to a decentralization of newsreporting and information dissemination in general. Alongside the many advantages of this decentralization, however, come many disadvantages, key among them being the undermining of the trust model of traditional news, in which news institutions act as \"gatekeepers\" of information [45] . Essentially, the old \"one-to-many\" model of news has been replaced by a new many-to-many mode [12] . Meanwhile, platforms are reluctant to take on the duties of gatekeeping. As recently evidenced by the controversy surrounding Twitter's decision to begin flagging the tweets of United States President Donald Trump for violent, misleading, or false statements, when platforms become gatekeepers, explosive social-political consequences can follow [51] . All told, this has resulted in a situation in which misinformation and its more dangerous cousin, disinformation, can spread swiftly through an online audience.\nDue to the proliferation of digital misinformation and disinformation it has become necessary to study a primary vector of their distribution within digital spaces: fake accounts. Research into fake accounts has primarily focused on detection and, increasingly, control. There have been two historic drivers of this: on the one hand, the influx of fake accounts into digital spaces, which has reached crisis proportions in recent years -e.g., in May 2019, Facebook reported that it took down three billion fake accounts, and five percent of its total monthly account activity was constituted by fake accounts [58] -combined with the ease of Twitter data collection.\nIn this paper, we take a critical look at the lack of conscious development of taxonomies around the phenomenon of fake accounts and propose a systematic way to think taxonomically about the phenomenon. Specifically, we combine methods from computer science and philosophy to create a comprehensive theory of fake accounts, including definitions of what it means to be \"fake\" and a fake account, and key taxonomical aspects of the latter. Along the way, we deconstruct the narrow binary thinking surrounding fake accounts as specifically exhibited in Facebook's conceptual framework of \"Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior\" and as more generally manifested in a series of false dichotomies about the phenomenon.\nTaxonomical Thinking Taxonomies must strike an optimal but difficult balance between mixed, or even opposing, intuitions and methods of analysis about the phenomenon they are intended to typologize or categorize. The most effective taxonomies are those which resist two major temptations: a) binary frameworks and b) over-reliance on either quantitative or qualitative methods of analysis. Along these lines, taxonomical thinking is a meta-level activity that occurs prior to (or simultaneously with) the development of an actual taxonomy. The would-be taxonomist should consciously think through not only the necessary typologies or categories, but the meta-types or meta-categories themselves, viz., the quantifiable and qualitative aspects -the empirical elements and the intuitions -that the types or categories are intended to capture.",
        "Due to the excellent performance, deep neural networks have been widely used in computer vision and nature language processing tasks. A stack of many layers is the obvious feature for deep neural networks, and how to transform and fuse information across layers efficiently is a key challenge. Neural Machine Translation(NMT), which is a multi-layer end-to-end structure, has achieved state-of-the-art performances in large-scale translation tasks (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015) . More recently, the system based on self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) is rapidly becoming the standard component in NMT, it demonstrates both superior performance and training speed compared to previous architectures using recurrent neural network (Wu et al., 2016) .\nFor vanilla Transformer, it only leverages the top layers of encoder and decoder in the subsequent process, which makes it impossible to take advantage of the useful information in other layers. At the same time, in the work of (Shi et al., 2016) show that both local and global syntactic information about source sentences is captured by the encoder, and different types of syntax is stored in different layers. Fusing the outputs of different layers is helpful to improve the model performance, some promising attempts have proven to be of profound value in computer vision tasks (Yu et al., 2018) and nature language process tasks (Shen et al., 2018; Dou et al., 2018) . In this work, we continue the line of research and go towards a more efficient approach to fuse information across layers. We try to fuse information across layers through residual tree aggregation of layers, it consists of a post-order binary tree and residual connection. To achieve better model performance, we validate many kinds of aggregation formulas as well. Our contributions are threefold:\n\u2022 Inspired by the approaches of dealing with the output of each layer in numerical analysis (Peters et al., 2018; He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017) , we propose an approach based on residual tree aggregation of layers(RTAL) to fuse information across layers.",
        "Many large scale cyber-physical systems, such as electric power grids [1] , intelligent transportation systems [2] , and industrial infrastructures [3] , are equipped with sensor networks, providing in situ and diverse measurements to monitor them. This makes possible the construction of system state estimates, which are essential to guarantee the safe and effective operation of these critical applications. Motivated by this, an intense research activity on the analysis and design of distributed estimation algorithms has ensued. In this way, each sensor, equipped with local communication and processing capabilities, interacts with neighboring nodes to compute joint estimates cooperatively.\nA way to obtain such estimates is to use a centralized observer, by which a super node collects all measurements from the nodes and fuses them in an optimal way. The ubiquitous Kalman filter [4] and related approaches have been used extensively for this purpose. However, these algorithms do not scale well as the size of the network increases and are vulnerable to single-point failures. This spawned research on the design of distributed estimation filters (for systems subject to known stochastic disturbances) for sensor networks communicating only locally over a possibly timevarying network [5] . While these methods are more scalable and robust to communication failures than their centralized counterparts, they generally have comparatively worse estimation error. An important class of algorithms that aim to approach the estimation performance of their Kalman filter counterparts, are Kalman-consensus filters, which combine a local Kalman-like update with average consensus to align agents' estimates [6] , [7] . When stochastic characterization of disturbances is not available, however, other techniques that leverage alternative information should be considered.\nIn case the disturbances are known to be bounded, interval observers are a popular method for obtaining robust, guaranteed estimates of the state, due to their simplicity and computational efficiency [8] - [10] . Hence, various approaches to design centralized interval observers for various classes of dynamical systems have been proposed [11] - [17] . The main idea in most of the aforementioned designs is to synthesize appropriate centralized observer gains to obtain a robustly stable and positive observer error system for all realizations of the existing uncertainties [11] , [14] . This strategy, which usually boils down to solving centralized semi-definite programs (SDP) subject to large numbers of constraints, leads to theoretical and computational difficulties, and thus infeasible solutions, especially for large-scale systems [15] - [17] . In addition to computational issues, the communication complexity of the centralized approach does not scale well as the size of the network increases. A recent study [18] proposes a distributed interval observer for blockdiagonalizable linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, which requires a certain structure on the dynamics and the output of the system. Another work [19] designs an observer for LTI systems under denial-of-service attacks. In addition, [20] proposes an internally positive representation (IPR)-based robust distributed interval observer for continuous-time LTI systems. However, the proposed design relies on similarity transformations and the satisfaction of certain algebraic constraints, which could lead to moderately-performing results. Furthermore, all of the aforementioned works use average consensus to share estimates throughout the network, which limits the effectiveness of the proposed methods with respect to time of convergence and estimation quality.\nContributions. To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, this work contributes to bridging the gap between interval observer design approaches and distributed estimation algorithms in the presence of distribution-free uncertainties.",
        "Flattening the COVID-19 infection curve is key to ensuring health services aren't overwhelmed by coronavirus cases [33] . It implies that the peak number of patients requiring healthcare at a time is reduced. In other words, flatter infection curve means that fewer people will need to be hospitalized at the same time, which can help prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. This is done by both pharmaceutical (e.g., vaccination, medicine) and nonpharmaceutical intervention measures (e.g., social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine). A flattened curve distributes the needs for healthcare over time and keeps the peak of hospitalizations under the healthcare capacity. Recently social network studies have been of interest to investigate how COVID-19 spreads over real human networks [3, 7, 21, 32] (even cyber-physical contagion of malicious malware over information networks have been studied [6] ). These works study the epidemic from the scope of network science and graph theory. In this perspective, the types of the social network model (e.g., scale-free, clustered scale-free, small-world) and its graph-theoretic features (e.g., clustering, small-worldness, assortativity, preferential mixing, community structures) are of importance in the epidemiological network study.\nThe literature on the network science and dynamic modelling perspective of the epidemic is quite expansive. Here, we review a few most-relevant works in terms of probabilistic models, graph properties, and network types. It has been shown that, for the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, clustering can speed-up propagation of the co-infected diseases as compared to non-clustered networks [18] , while, conversely, it slows down the spread of epidemic over hierarchical social networks [17] and raises the epidemic outbreak threshold in single infection outbreak [19] . In another perspective, [37] shows that epidemics spread faster over networks with a higher level of overlapping communities. The effect of clustering in social networks is further studied by comparing scale-free and clustered scale-free networks, both flattening the infection curve [11] and epidemic outbreak in the SIS model [12] . Clustering plays a key role in the controllability of social networks [9] , Ebola virus transmission [36] , and respiratory infections epidemic [41] among others. Relevant works also show that, under the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, community lock-downs are less effective than self-isolation and social distancing [16] . No work in the literature studies how small-worldness affects the infection curve flattening. Few works are focused on the effect of small-worldness on diffusion (of information/disease) process [29] , herd immunization [40] , and epidemic outbreak (by tuning the average path length) [31] .\nThe other relevant works on immunization of epidemic spreading in networks include [14, 24, 27, 42, 45, 47] . The work [14] exploits community structures to control epidemic. Bond percolation models to study immunization are discussed in [27] . Comparison between static and dynamic immunization strategies are discussed in [45] . The work [42] proposes novel optimization strategies for community-based immunization of targeted nodes. Mitigation strategies to prevent disease propagation over multi-layer networks is discussed in [24, 47] .\nIn this paper, we study the targeted isolation of individuals in small-world networks modelled based on Watts-Strogatz (WS) model [44] .",
        "In wireless systems, most resources are typically used to serve disadvantaged users that have low path gains to the base station (access point). Such users may be in a shadowed area of the cell, or located indoors while the base station is located outdoors. In addition, such users typically see channels with low, or even unit, rank -prohibiting the transmission of more than a single data stream.\nOne technique for improving service to disadvantaged users is to use repeaters that amplify and instantaneously re-transmit the signal [1] - [7] . Repeaters, also known as full-duplex relays, have a small form-factor, and are relatively inexpensive to build and deploy. They pose, unlike access points in distributed MIMO, no requirements on phase coherency between geographically separated units.\nSingle-antenna repeaters use the same antenna for reception and transmission, and require a circulator to isolate the antenna, the transmitter port, and the receiver port -something considered challenging to implement. Dual-antenna repeaters have two antenna ports, one for transmission and one for reception. They have been standardized in 3GPP, in the form of network-controlled repeaters [8] , and typically have a donor (pickup) antenna outdoors and an antenna indoors to provide coverage.\nOur focus is on dual-antenna repeaters. These repeaters have one antenna that transmits on uplink and receives on downlink, and one that does the opposite, regardless of the duplexing mode. The first antenna is linked, via a forward path with amplification, to the second antenna; the second antenna is linked, via a reverse path with amplification, to the first antenna. In TDD operation, the roles of the repeater's antennas alternate over time according to the network's TDD pattern. The repeater implementations we envision introduce no appreciable delay. All what is required is an amplifier circuit in either direction, a tunable amplitude-and phasecompensation RF circuit, and a control channel connection (in-band or in a separate band). Also, unless its antennas are separated sufficiently far apart, the repeater would need either internal echo cancelation circuitry, or a switch synchronized with the TDD pattern.",
        "The theory of stable matching, initiated by [GS62] , has led to a deep understanding of two-sided matching markets and inspired successful real-world market designs. Examples of such markets include marriage markets, online dating, assigning students to schools, labor markets, and college admissions. In a market matching \"men\" to \"women\" (a commonly used analogy), a matching is stable if no man-woman pair prefer each other over their assigned partners.\nA fundamental issue is characterizing stable outcomes of matching markets, i.e. the outcome agents should expect based on market characteristics. Such characterizations are not only useful for describing outcomes but also likely to be fruitful in market designs. Numerous papers so far have studied stable matchings in random markets, in which agents' preferences are generated uniformly at random [Pit89, KMP90, AKL17, Pit19] . This paper contributes to the literature by expanding these results to a situation where preferences are drawn according to different tiers of \"public scores\", generalizing the uniform case. We ask how public scores, which correspond to the attractiveness of agents, impact the outcome in the market.\nFormally, we study the following class of tiered random markets. There are n men and n women. Each side of the market is divided into a constant number of \"soft tiers\". There is a fraction of i women in tier i, each of which has a public score \u03b1 i . And there is a fraction of \u03b4 j men in tier j, each of which has a public score \u03b2 j . For each agent we draw a complete preference list by sampling without replacement proportionally to the public scores of agents on the other side of the market.1 So a man's preference list is generated by sampling women one at a time without replacement according to a distribution that is proportional to their public scores. Using \u03b1, to denote the vector of scores and proportions of tiers on the women's side, we see that the marginal probability of drawing a woman in tier i is \u03b1 i /(n \u2022 \u03b1). An analogous statement holds for the tier configuration \u03b2, \u03b4 of the men. These preferences are a natural next-step beyond the uniform distribution over preference lists, and provide a priori heterogeneous quality of agents while still being tractable to theoretical analysis.\nOur primary goal is to study the average rank of agents in each tier under the man-optimal stable matching, with a focus on the asymptotic behavior in large markets. The rank of an agent is defined to be the index of their partner on their full preference list, where lower is better.",
        "A large literature in mathematical epidemiology has studied how to control and eradicate diseases by means of therapeutics and vaccinations, [Nowzari et al., 2016 , Behncke, 2000] . However, the influenza pandemic of 1918 and the current COVID-19 pandemic underscore the difficulty of such eradication in the case of virulent viruses, and have necessitated measures to reduce transmissions, for example with the use of face masks [Chu et al., 2020] , social distancing and costly lockdown measures [Flaxman et al., 2020 , Bertuzzo et al., 2020] [ Di et al., 2020] . Another powerful tool to limit transmissions is early identification of infected individuals and epidemic hot-spots in local communities, which can both be accomplished by testing [Grassly et al., 2020 , OECD, 2020] . Nevertheless, during the COVID-19 pandemic testing resources have proven to be limited and expensive in much of the world [AACC, 2020 , Apuzzo and Gebredikan, 2020 , Mervosh and Fernandez, 2020 , Pullano et al., 2020] ; in the US, lack of testing capacity not only helped spread the virus but also led to the underestimation of the severity of the pandemic in the first half of 2020, [Fink and Baker, 2020] . This crucial role of testing notwithstanding, the question of how limited testing resources can be deployed to optimally control the spread of a pandemic has attracted relatively little systematic attention.\nIn this paper, we derive an optimal (dynamic) testing strategy in an SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model of epidemics. Because undetected individuals may pass the disease to others and may be more likely to develop serious symptoms requiring hospitalization, we start by assuming that the number of undetected infected individuals has to be kept below a maximum i max at all times. We show that the optimal testing strategy takes a simple form: the testing rate has to be time-varying in order to satisfy the constraint, and takes the form of a most rapid approach path, [Spence and Starrett, 1975] . Namely, there is no testing until undetected infections reach i max , after which testing resources are used to keep infections at the threshold i max until infections decline naturally, bringing the pandemic to an effective close. The intuition for this result is that it is not worth using testing resources to keep undetected infections strictly below i max so long as the pandemic is still ongoing and infections cannot be brought down to zero. Hence, the best approach is to let the infection reach the threshold and then keep it there with a time-varying testing policy.",
        "Given a classification task, which performance metric should the classifier optimize? This question is often faced by practitioners while developing machine learning solutions. For example, consider cancer diagnosis where a doctor applies a cost-sensitive predictive model to classify patients into cancer categories [12] . Although it is clear that the chosen costs directly determine the model decisions, it is not clear how to quantify the expert's intuition into precise quantitative cost trade-offs, i.e., the performance metric [1, 13] . Hiranandani et al. [3, 4] addressed this issue by formalizing the Metric Elicitation (ME) framework, whose goal is to estimate a performance metric using user feedback over confusion matrices. The motivation is that by employing metrics that reflect a user's innate trade-offs given the task, context, and population at hand, one can learn models that best capture the user preferences [3] . As humans are often inaccurate in providing absolute quality feedback [10] , Hiranandani et al. [3] propose to use pairwise comparison queries, where the user (oracle) is asked to provide a relative preference over two confusion matrices. Figure 1 (reproduced from [3] ) depicts the ME framework.\nPrior literature on ME has proposed elicitation strategies for binary [3] , multiclass [4] , and multiclass-multigroup [6, 5] classification settings, which assume the presence of an oracle that provides relative preference feedback over confusion matrices. However, to our knowledge, there are no reported implementations testing the ME framework and the assumption that users can effectively report confusion matrix comparisons. In this paper, we bring theory closer to practice by providing a first ever practical implementation of the ME framework and its evaluation. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a visualization for pairwise comparison of confusion matrices that adapts the visualization of individual confusion matrices from Shen et al.",
        "Developing industry-strength autonomous applications requires teams of engineers with different backgrounds. Robotic Operating System version 2 (ROS2) is a powerful middleware over which modular software components can be developed and composed easily to create autonomous applications. To leverage these benefits and the vast amount of open-source contributions to autonomous applications, ROS2 is widely used even in time-critical systems such as self-driving cars.\nIn recent years, there have been efforts to develop timing analysis and optimization approaches for ROS2-based applications, e.g., [1] - [5] . These approaches typically assume that the application models are well-defined, i.e., the execution times of and the precedence relations between ROS2 callbacks are known. However, in many industry scenarios, such models are not provided by application developers. Further, during system integration, it is challenging to obtain many details-especially at the level of callbacks-due to confidentiality reasons.\nIn parallel to the model-based techniques, tracing ROS2based applications have also gained interest. In this context, ros2 tracing provides a framework based on Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation (LTTng) [6] . It has tracepoints in ROS2 functions to identify callbacks and topics and also track them during runtime. Autoware Perf [7] and CARET [8] add more tracepoints and use trace data to measure the response time of a callback, the communication latency between a pair of callbacks, and the end-to-end latency of a callback-chain.\nProposed timing model synthesis framework: This paper bridges the gap between tracing and timing analysis. We use extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) [9] for tracing. Compared to LTTng, it does not require direct instrumentation and recompilation of standard ROS2 libraries and offers efficient trace filtering. Unlike LTTng, eBPF does not give access to local variables in functions and, hence, we could not reuse many tracepoints identified by [6] - [8] . Besides probing new ROS2 functions, we traverse complex data structures of their arguments to get desired information, e.g., topic names, callback IDs, and source timestamps of data. Our proposed framework, in Fig. 1 , provides three tracers: (i) ROS2-INIT tracer logs the initialization of ROS2 nodes. (ii) During runtime, ROS2-RT tracer tracks the start and end of callbacks and data read from and write to Data Distribution Service (DDS) topics. Unlike [6] - [8] , it also tracks client callbacks and message synchronization, which are found, e.g., in AUTOWARE's Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) [10] . (iii) Kernel tracer logs scheduler events in the operating system (OS) related to ROS2 callbacks only with the help of eBPF's trace filtering.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1 , our proposed framework uses the collected traces to synthesize timing models of applications as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We model ROS2 callbacks as tasks (or vertices) and DDS communication between them using precedence relations (or edges).",
        "Knowledge distillation, as a fundamental technique for model compression and knowledge transfer in deep neural networks, has wide application in the field of neural machine translation (NMT) [Hinton et al., 2015; Gou et al., 2021] . Knowledge distillation involves transferring knowledge from a larger, cumbersome model to a smaller, more efficient one, serving purposes such as compressing machine translation models and simplifying training targets for non-autoregressive models [Phuong and Lampert, 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Wang and Yoon, 2021; Xiao et al., 2023] .\nGiven the variance in training targets, knowledge distillation in NMT can be divided into two main categories: sentencelevel knowledge distillation and token-level knowledge distillation. Sentence-level knowledge distillation mainly focuses on simplifying the training target to improve the translation accuracy [Gajbhiye et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2022a] . Specifically, given a source and target sentence pair, sentence-level distillation firstly feeds the source sentence into the teacher model to generate a pseudo target sentence, then the pseudo target sentence is leveraged as the training target of student model. Compared with the origin target sentence, the distribution of pseudo target sentence is simpler, and thus easier to learn for student model [Kim and Rush, 2016; Zhang et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2022] .\nIn contrast, token-level knowledge distillation focuses on enhancing translation quality by a finer granularity [Kim and Rush, 2016; Mun'im et al., 2019] . Different with sentencelevel knowledge distillation which only leverages the output sentence of teacher model, token-level knowledge distillation further uses the token distribution in the output sentence. The student model is trained to output a similar distribution with the teacher model on every token, which helps the student model learn detail knowledge on token difference and be more suitable for texts with high lexical diversity [Wang et al., 2020] .\nHowever, empirical studies have revealed divergent performances between sentence-level and token-level distillation across different scenarios. Specifically, while some scenarios benefit more from the global structure and semantic consistency provided by sentence-level distillation [Kim and Rush, 2016; Chen et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021b; Lei et al., 2022; Mhamdi et al., 2023] , other scenarios require the finegrained knowledge transfer that token-level distillation offers [Liao et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2023] . This variation in performance has led to confusion regarding the empirical selection of knowledge distilla-arXiv:2404.14827v1 [cs.CL] 23 Apr 2024 tion methods. In this study, we conduct analytical experiments to explore the general suitable scenario of two knowledge distillation methods. Given that the training target of sentencelevel distillation (simplified sentence by teacher model) is easier than that of the token-level distillation (detailed token distribution of teacher model). We hypothesize that sentencelevel distillation is suitable for \"complex\" scenarios and the token-level distillation is suitable for \"simple\" scenarios.",
        "OVEL coronavirus (COVID- 19) , resulting from a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a pandemic worldwide in recent times [1] , [2] . The number of infected cases as well as the death rate is increasing rapidly. It is reported that about 19,000,000 people have been infected with COVID-19, the death cases are around 700,000, and the number of recovered patients are around 10,000,000 globally [3] . The universal transmission of COVID-19 has put a large amount of the world's population into quarantine, and ravaged numerous industrial sectors which in turn caused a worldwide financial crisis.\nThe most typical signs of the novel coronavirus include fever, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and headache [4] , [5] (e-mail: milonislam@uwaterloo.ca, karray@uwaterloo.ca).\nReda Alhajj is with the Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada (e-mail: alhajj@ucalgary.ca).\nin some scenarios, no symptoms are visible (asymptomatic) that make the disease an even bigger threat to public health. The reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis [6] . However, the lack of resources and strict test environment requirements restrict fast and effective screening of suspicious cases. Furthermore, RT-PCR inspection also experiences high false negative rates [7] . Unfortunately, the only solution to effectively combat this transmissible disease, is through clinical vaccines as well as precise drug/therapy practices, which are not yet available. COVID-19 has proven to be amongst the most dangerous ailments that have posed severe threat to human civilization. With the evolution of modern technology in the past few decades, ingenious solutions have been created to assist disease diagnosis, prevention as well as control which leverage smart healthcare tools and facilities [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] .",
        "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are frequently trained using one of the many variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). These methods update a network's parameters using the gradients of the loss w.r.t. said parameters. DNNs have many degrees of freedom (i.e. weights), and their objective functions are thus very-high dimensional. For example, ResNet50 has over 23 million trainable parameters. The \"loss landscape\" is the same number of dimensions as the weight space plus 1, as each possible configuration of the DNN is evaluated for its loss over some number of test examples (i.e. examples not seen during training).\nThe first few sections of this paper cover the theoretical background surrounding the loss landscape and introduce the specific visualization method used in this work. The loss landscape (also referred to as \"loss surface\" and \"objective landscape\") is constructed by calculating the loss of multiple points in the weight space (i.e. different configurations) of a DNN. Later in the paper we introduce the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) and iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) by (Frankle & Carbin, 2019) , and apply the same loss visualizations to winning lottery tickets (WLTs) created using IMP.\nAll figures in this paper contain a hyperlink in the caption to view the same data with LossP lot (Bain et al., 2021) , an in-browser application built specifically to visualize these types of surface plots. The projected contours, radius based clippings, and other settings can be manually controlled from LossP lot.",
        "Due to the variability of renewable energy sources (RES), maximising their utilisation is arguably one of the biggest challenges facing energy system operators in Australia and around the world. Maximising this utilisation requires energy storage, which, in the case of large energy volumes, may be problematic as large-scale battery storage alone is too costly and pumped-hydro storage is limited for geographical reasons [1] . A promising long-term solution for maximising the integration of VRE consists of building a new infrastructure for transporting VRE in the form of electricity and/or H 2 . Large-scale renewable energy hubs coupled to H 2 production hubs may unlock substantial economies of scale predicated on building a cost-effective VRE transport infrastructure. Designing a costeffective infrastructure will need to address the challenging questions of (i) whether VRE hubs and electrolysers should be co-located, (ii) whether to transport VRE as molecules in H 2 pipelines or as electrons in electricity transmission lines, and (iii) the drivers and conditions that favour one investment option over another. Answering the above questions is a massive undertaking that requires an integrated electricity and H 2 system (IEHS) modelling framework to assess costs and benefits of different investment options.\nAs many of the challenges identified here are relatively new, existing knowledge and modelling tools are inadequate for performing such a large-scale optimal integrated infrastructure design exercise. In particular, existing state-of-the-art literature is either limited in scope to H 2 supply chain only [2] [3] [4] [5] , i.e., disregarding electricity infrastructure options, or is limited in the variety of considered infrastructure technologies [6] [7] [8] [9] . Considering all the relevant transport and storage technologies in an integrated framework can unlock superior design solutions. This is especially true when considering the specific features associated with RES, and in particular when they are clustered in large-scale renewable energy hubs where wind and solar farms may be located far from the location of H 2 utilisation.",
        "Optimal transport (OT) [39, 33] is a mathematical framework that seeks the most efficient way of transforming one probability measure into another. The OT framework leads to a geometrically intuitive and robust metric on the set of probability measures, referred to as the Wasserstein distance. It has become an increasingly popular tool in machine learning, data analysis, and computer vision [20, 19] . OT's applications encompass generative modeling [4, 37, 21] , domain adaptation [11, 12] , transfer learning [3, 27] , supervised learning [14] , clustering [16] , image and pointcloud registration [15, 5, 25] , and even inverse problems [31] , among others. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in OT for measures supported on manifolds [7, 36] . This surging interest is primarily due to: 1) real-world data is often supported on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in larger-dimensional Euclidean spaces, and 2) many applications inherently involve non-Euclidean geometry, e.g., geophysical data or cortical signals in the brain.\nIn this paper, we are interested in efficiently comparing probability measures supported on the unit circle, aka circular probability measures, using the optimal transport framework. Such probability measures, with their densities often represented as circular/rose histograms, are prevalent in many applications, from computer vision and signal processing domains to geology and astronomy. For instance, in classic computer vision, the color content of an image can be accounted for by its hue in the HSV space, leading to one-dimensional circular histograms. Additionally, local image/shape descriptors are often represented via circular histograms, as evidenced in classic computer vision papers like SIFT [28] and ShapeContext [6] . In structural geology, the orientation of rock formations, such as bedding planes, fault lines, and joint sets, can be represented via circular histograms [38] . In signal processing, circular histograms are commonly used to represent the phase distribution of periodic signals [26] . Additionally, a periodic signal can be normalized and represented as a circular probability density function (PDF) .\nNotably, a large body of literature exists on circular statistics [18] . More specific to our work, however, are the seminal works of [13] and [34] , which provide a thorough study of the OT problem and transportation distances on the circle (see also [8] ). OT on circles has also been recently revisited in various papers [17, 7] , further highlighting the topic's timeliness. Unlike OT on the real line, generally, the OT problem between probability measures defined on the circle does not have a closed-form solution. This stems from the intrinsic metric on the circle and the fact that there are two paths between any pair of points on a circle (i.e., clockwise and counter-clockwise). Interestingly, however, when one of the probability measures is the Lebesgue measure, i.e., the uniform distribution, the 2-Wasserstein distance on the circle has a closed-form solution, which we will discuss in the Background section.\nWe present the Linear Circular OT (LCOT), a new transport-based distance for circular probability measures.",
        "One of the main challenges of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the automatic processing of large amounts of unstructured textual data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI concerned with the development of algorithms capable of processing, analyzing and understanding large amounts of such data (text or speech) in human language. The application of these methods in the biomedical domain is called Clinical NLP (cNLP) and refers to the analysis of clinical narratives and their manipulation and interrogation.\nEnglish is by far the most resource rich language that has contributed to the development of the cNLP; on the other hand, its use and subsequent performance evaluation are still limited for other languages, e.g. Italian, due to a lack of available data [1] . Annotations on clinical narratives by medical experts are often necessary to train supervised machine learning algorithms. Unfortunately, a medical observation can be affected by the interpretation, experience and abbreviations used by the specific author [2] . All these considerations constitute key challenges for the current SoA of Natural Language Understanding (NLU).\nIn radiology, a large amount of textual data is generated daily in the form of free-text reports (e.g., transcriptions). Many medical societies (e.g. European Society of Radiology and Radiological Society of North America [3, 4] ) recognize the increasing need for the adoption of structured reporting (SR) in clinical practice and encourage all institutions to conceive reference registries. These premises motivated the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) to design structured reports for CT scans of patients with oncological conditions such as Breast, Lung, Colon, Rectum, Lymphoma, Pancreas, and Stomach cancer, as well as Covid19 [5] . However, the fast rate at which unstructured clinical information is being created calls for NLP solutions to transform existing reports into structured representations [2, 6] .",
        "Most classical autonomous navigation systems are capable of moving robots from one point to another, often with verifiable collision-free guarantees, under a set of parameters (e.g. maximum speed, sampling rate, inflation radius, etc.) that have been fine-tuned for the deployment environment. However, these parameters need to be re-tuned to adapt to different environments, which requires extra time and energy spent onsite during deployment, and more importantly, expert knowledge of the inner workings of the underlying navigation system [1] , [2] .\nA recent thrust to alleviate the costs associated with expert re-tuning in new environments is to learn an adaptive parameter tuning scheme from demonstration [3] . Although this approach removes the requirement of expert tuning, it still depends on access to a human demonstration, and the learned parameters are typically only applicable to the training environment.

        "The term Software Engineering was coined in 1968 at a conference whose aim was to discuss the need for the software development discipline to be more strongly based on theoretical and engineering principles (Naur and Randell, 1969) . The Waterfall model, a then-popular model used in manufacturing, was adopted as the standard approach for developing computer software. As time progressed, it became apparent that a strict implementation of this model was not appropriate for software. A number of modifications, for example Spiral (Boehm, 1988) , and alternative models, for example XP (Beck, 2000) , have emerged. The authors of the various models have different viewpoints on what kind of activity software development actually is. Earlier models view soft-ware development as an engineering activity and focus on control. More recent models adopt the viewpoint of 'software-as-a-service' and focus on effective communications. However, regardless of the huge variation in approach, until recently, the accepted wisdom by all methodology architects was that, in order to be fully effective, their approach must be followed exactly, with nothing added and nothing missed (Cusumano et al., 2003) .\nWe have long understood from experiences in industry that this 'wisdom' is not based on what actually happens in the field, and have advocated with others the need to more deeply understand the process of developing computer software in order to support industry in its need to select practices in a flexible way, according to objectives and context (Bajec et al., 2007; Fitzgerald, 1997; Hansson et al., 2009; Kirk and Tempero, 2004; Kirk and Tempero, 2005; Kirk, 2007) . This viewpoint has now become the accepted one (Avison and Pries-Heje, 2008; MacCormack et al., 2012; Petersen and Wohlin, 2009; de Azevedo Santos et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2010) . The traditional viewpoint -that methodologies and practices should be adopted and used as prescribed -has thus been superseded by one of acceptance that tailoring is both necessary and unavoidable.\nIf tailoring is of the essence, we clearly must strive to fully understand the nature of the relationships between objectives, process and context. Only then will we be in a position to advise industry on which practices might be most suitable or to predict project outcomes based on context and practices implemented. The sole route to this kind of general understanding is through theory-building (Gilmore, 1990) . Without an understanding of the relationships between objectives, practices, context and outcomes, we can at best expose patterns based on data or observations. Such patterns represent correlations and correlations can not be used to predict in a general way. For consistent prediction, we must create frameworks based on causal relationships i.e. theoretical models. Indeed, Basili et al.",
        "The earth observation satellite (EOS) plays an important role in environmental monitoring, land surveys and detailed investigation of sensitive areas and other fields. Satellite mission planning and scheduling problem mainly contains two parts: data acquisition task scheduling and data downlink scheduling. The data acquisition is an imaging activity, while the data downlink is a playback activity as shown in Figure 1 . When the data acquisition activity is completed, the corresponding imaging data will be stored in the satellite, then which need to be transmitted to the receiving resources (like ground stations) by data downlink activities. In theory, the data of each downlink activity could be a partial (incomplete) imaging data, a complete imaging data or even a combination of multiple complete or partial imaging data.\nWith the development of space technology, the imaging capability of satellites has been greatly enhancing, which causes a big explosion in the amount of imaging data. GAOFEN II (Huang et al., 2018) , launched in 2014, marks the arrival of \"submeter Era\" for EOS in China.\nWhile the downlink capacity of satellite antennas does not develop synchronously. The downlink rate of GAOFEN II antenna is only 2 450Mbps. There is a big gap, the imaging data obtained by one-second observation will spend 4.5 seconds to play back, between the data acquisition capability and the data download capability. The big gap poses a new challenge to SDSP. SDSP and its variations have been studied by many authors. Some of these works were focused on a single satellite (Karapetyan et al., 2015 , Peng et al., 2017 , Chang et al., 2020 , Song et al., 2019b) whereas others were more general purpose in the special satellite constellation or multi-satellite (Bianchessi et al., 2007 , Wang et al., 2011 , Al et al., 2004) . On the other hand, some researchers saw SDSP as a time-dependent or resource-dependent problem and focused on the time-switch constraints between satellites and ground stations (Du et al., 2019 , Marinelli et al., 2011 , Verfaillie et al., 2010 , Zhang et al., 2019 , Zufferey et al., 2008 , Chang et al., 2022 , Lu et al., 2021 , Chang et al., 2021b , Chang et al., 2021a , Chang et al., 2020) .",
        "In Naive Ray-Tracing (RT) each ray is tested against each polygon in the scene, this leads to N x M intersection tests per frame, assuming that we have N rays and M polygons. Performance is thus low, especially with moderately complex scenes due to the sheer amount of intersection tests computed. To optimize this naive approach (and RT in general) there are two common approaches to reduce the number of intersection tests, which are the bottleneck of the algorithm, Object Hierarchies and Spatial Hierarchies. Our work instead focuses on Ray Hierarchies and how to optimize them. This is a less well explored area of the RT domain and one that is complementary to the Object-Spatial Hierarchies. This paper presents the Coherent Ray-Space Hierarchy (CRSH) algorithm. CRSH builds upon the Ray-Space Hierarchy (RSH) [RAH07] and Ray-Sorting algorithms [GL10] . RSH, described by Roger et al., uses a tree that contains bounding sphere-cones that encompass a local set of rays. The tree is built bottom-up and traversed top-down. Our CRSH algorithm adds Ray-Sorting, described by Garanzha and Loop, to the mix in order to achieve higher efficiency in each tree node and then expands on this basis with whole mesh culling and improved hashing methods.\nWe hypothesize that improving the coherency of the rays contained within each tree node shall lead to tighter bounding spherecones which, in turn, should reduce the amount of ray-geometry intersections. We use specialized ray hashing methods, tuned to the ray types we enumerated (e.g. shadow, reflection and refraction), to further improve the efficiency of the hierarchy. Finally we also introduce whole mesh bounding spheres to reduce even further the number of intersection tests at the top level of the hierarchy. This shallow spherical BVH allows us to further reduce the amount of ray-primitive intersection tests. We note that our technique uses rasterization to determine the primary intersections thus reserving the use of RT for secondaries.",
        "Retrieval-augmented generation systems (RAG) combine a generative language model with a non-parametric datastore. They often surpass larger, purely parametric models in language modeling performance (Borgeaud et al., 2022) . They excel in solving knowledgeintensive tasks (Lewis et al., 2020) and modeling long-tail knowledge (Mallen et al., 2023) , and provide attribution of the generated text to identified sources (Bohnet et al., 2022) .\nA particularly attractive feature of RAG is the ability to update a system's world knowledge without the need for costly retraining. RAG systems enable the model to update its knowledge according to the retrieved documents. Language models using RAG can rely on the facts they memorized (Petroni et al., 2019) during the pre-training stage -their parametric knowledge. Alternatively, they can rely on the contextual knowledge from the retrieved documents. If the two sources contradict each other, we speak of a knowledge conflict (Longpre et al., 2021) , also referred to as context-memory conflict. A knowledge update happens when the model changes its original parametric answer upon seeing a conflicting context. Knowledge conflicts happen in three important RAG applications. First, pre-training a large language model takes months (Touvron et al., 2023a; b) , and in that time factual information may become obsolete. Second, in the currently prevailing transfer learning paradigm (Bommasani et al., 2021) most end users don't train models from scratch. Instead, they rely on a few pre-trained models and adapt them to downstream tasks by fine-tuning, prompting, or retrieval augmentation. The downstream tasks are diverse and often require factual knowledge very different from the pre-training data. Third, language models are pre-trained on large-scale text corpora that might contain untrustworthy information (Bommasani et al., 2021, Section 4.6) . Failure to update the parametric knowledge with correct domain-specific information poses a significant risk for the end user.",
        "Monte Carlo (MC) integration is a simple numerical recipe for solving complicated integration problems. The main drawback of the straightforward approach is the relatively slow convergence rate that manifests as high variance of MC estimators. Hence, many approaches have been developed to improve the efficiency. Among the most frequently used ones are techniques focusing on carefully placing samples, e.g. antithetic sampling, stratification, quasi-random sampling, or importance sampling. A complimentary way to further reduce variance is to leverage hierarchical integration or the concept of control variates. In this article, we focus on the latter approach and present parametric control variates based on neural networks.\nReducing variance by control variates (CV) amounts to leveraging an approximate solution of the integral corrected by an estimate of the approximation error. The principle is given by the following identity:\nEQUATION\nInstead of integrating the original function f to obtain the solution F , we leverage an \u03b1-scaled approximation G, that corresponds to integrating a (different) function \u0434-the control variate-over the same domain D, i.e. G = \u222b D \u0434(x) dx (we drop D in the rest of this section for brevity). The approximation error is corrected by adding an integral of the difference f (x)-\u03b1 \u2022\u0434(x); this makes the right-hand side equal to the left-hand one.\nThe numerical efficiency of estimating the right-hand side, relative to estimating the original integral, depends on the scaled control variate making the integration easier, for example by making the integrand smoother as illustrated in Figure 2 . This will typically be the case as long as f and \u0434 are (anti-)correlated. In fact, the scaling coefficient \u03b1, which controls the strength of applying the CV, should be derived from the correlation of the two functions. In a nutshell, a successful application of control variates necessitates a \u0434 that approximates the integrand f sufficiently well, and permits an efficient evaluation and computation of G and \u03b1.\nIn this work, we propose to infer the control variate \u0434 from observations of f using machine learning. Since the control variate is learned, the main challenge becomes representing it in a form that permits (efficiently) computing its integral, G = \u222b \u0434(x) dx. We propose to sidestep this integration problem by introducing a CV model that satisfies G = \u222b \u0434(x) dx by construction: we decompose the control variate \u0434(x) into its normalized form-the shape \u0434(x)and its integral G, such that \u0434(x) = \u0434(x) \u2022 G. The shape and the integral can be modeled independently. We infer the integral G and the coefficient \u03b1 using one neural network for each. For the shape \u0434, we leverage a tailored variant of normalizing flows, which are capable of representing normalized functions. The parameters of the flow are inferred using a set of neural networks.\nWhen the control variate is designed well, the residual integral \u222b f (x) -\u03b1 \u2022 \u0434(x) dx carries less energy than the original integral \u222b f (x) dx.",
        "Infectious diseases like seasonal influenza and COVID-19 are major global health issues, affecting millions of people [14, 34] . Forecasting disease time-series (such as infected cases) at various temporal and spatial resolutions is a non-trivial and important task [34] . Estimating various indicators e.g. future incidence, peak time/intensity and onset, gives policy makers valuable lead time to plan interventions and optimize supply chain decisions, as evidenced by various Centers for Disease Control (CDC) prediction initiatives for diseases like dengue, influenza and COVID-19 [33, 16, 30] .\nStatistical approaches [5] for the forecasting problem are fairly new compared to more traditional mechanistic approaches [13, 38] . While valuable for 'what-if' scenario generation, mechanistic models have several issues in real-time forecasting. For example, they cannot easily leverage data from multiple indicators or predict composite signals. In contrast, deep learning approaches in this context are a novel direction and have become increasingly promising, as they can ingest numerous data signals without laborious feature engineering [37, 33, 1, 8] .\nHowever, there are several challenges in designing such methods, primarily with the need to handle uncertainty to give more reliable forecasts [14] . Decision makers need to understand the inherent uncertainty in the forecasts so that they can make robust decisions [32] . Providing probabilistic forecasts and interpreting what signals cause the model uncertain is also helpful to better communicate the situation to the public. Due to the inherent complexity of the prediction problem, just like weather forecasting, so-called 'point' forecasts without uncertainty are increasingly seen as not very useful for planning for such high-stake decisions [14, 33] .\nUncertainty quantification in purely statistical epidemic forecasting models is a little explored area. Most traditional methods optimize for accuracy of 'point-estimates' only. Some approaches that model the underlying generative distribution of the data naturally provide a probability distribution of the outputs [4, 5, 44, 32] , but they do not focus on producing calibrated distributions [12, 22] as well.",
        "The Minimum-weight Odd T -Join problem (MOTJ) asks for an odd-cardinality T -join of minimum weight for a given subset T of vertices in an undirected, edge-weighted graph. The MOTJ problem is the graph special case of optimization in binary hypergraphs. This area contains relevant problems on graphs, including open cases of the Max Cut problem, or some multiflow problems. Stimulating minimax conjectures of Seymour's have been solved in special cases (see e.g., Guenin and Abdi [1, 2, 16] ) but optimization algorithms were not well-known, not even for cases where the minimax theorems conjectured by Seymour hold.\nIn this paper we study a handful of interconnected optimization problems in undirected, edge-weighted graphs that involve parity constraints on certain edge sets. Such problems are considered in a general framework under the term of \"binary hypergraphs\" [22, Chapter 80], subject to a huge number of deep results and conjectures since the seventies until now (see e.g., [1, 2, 11, 15, 16, 24] ; those published before 2002 are summarized in Schrijver's book [22] ). A first round of problems like T -joins or odd cycles for non-negative edge-weights have been studied in the last century [10, 13] . Then time has come for adding more binary constraints [11, 15, 16] , bringing in new results and new challenges.\nIn this work we consider the main algorithmic challenges. Among other variants, we study the problems of finding a minimum-weight odd T -join (MOTJ), a shortest odd cycle (SOC) or a shortest odd path between two given vertices (SOP) in an undirected graph with conservative weights, that is, when negative weights but no cycles with negative total weight are allowed. Our results are the following:\n(a) The variant of SOC where the solution has to contain a given vertex of the graph is NPhard, implying NP-hardness for the SOP problem as well. The complexity of the latter has been an open question by Lov\u00e1sz (Open Problem 27 in Schrijver's book [22] ) for the last more than twenty years.\n(b) The MOTJ problem for non-negative weights can be solved in 2 |T |/2 O(n 4 ) time on an nvertex graph. Our method is based on structural properties of shortest cycles in graphs with conservative weights, yielding an algorithm for SOC that is efficient when negative-weight edges span a bounded number of components.\n(c) The SOC problem for conservative weights is polynomially equivalent to MOTJ, and although we do solve certain special cases in polynomial time, it remains open in general.\nWe prove in addition that finding two openly disjoint paths between two vertices with minimum total weight in an undirected graph with conservative weights in NP-hard; this problem has, quite surprisingly, also been open. A major benefit of our results is finding connections among a so far chaotic set of influential problems, and sorting them into polynomial-time solvable, open and NP-hard cases (cf.",
        "Multi-media generation with diffusion models has attracted extensive attention recently. Following breakthroughs in image [34] and audio generation [26] , multi-media generation like video remains challenging due to increased data and content size and the added complexity of dealing with both audio and visual components. Challenges for generating multi-modal content include 1) time variant feature maps leading to computationally expensive architecture and 2) audio and video having to be coherent and synchronized in terms of semantics and temporal alignment.\nExisting research has predominantly concentrated on unidirectional cross-modal generation, such as producing * Work done while intern at Microsoft Research audio from video cues [28, 54] and vice versa [14, 23] . These approaches typically employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a conditional data distribution p(x|y). Although these models have shown considerable promise, their unidirectional nature is a limitation; a model trained for p(x|y) is not suited for tasks requiring p(y|x). However, Bayes' theorem elucidates that a joint distribution can be decomposed into p(x, y) = p(x|y)p(y) = p(y|x)p(y), suggesting that the construction of a joint distribution inherently encompasses bi-directional conditional distributions. With the advent of the iterative sampling procedure in diffusion models, classifier guidance [2, 12, 45] has emerged as a viable approach for training an unconditional model capable of conditional generation. This approach has been extensively adopted in addressing the inverse problems associated with diffusion models, such as image restoration [16] and text-driven generation [33] .\nMM-diffusion [37] represents a groundbreaking foray into the simultaneous modeling of video and audio content. The architecture employs a dual U-Net structure, interconnected through cross-attention mechanisms [48] , to handle both video and audio signals.",
        "A fundamental problem in computer science is the question whether a randomized algorithm has any sort of advantage over a deterministic algorithm. In particular, theoretical computer scientists are concerned with the question: P = BPP? Here, P contains decision problems that can be solved deterministically in polynomial-time, while BPP contains decision problems that can be solved with randomized algorithms in polynomial-time (under a two-sided, bounded error probability [2] ). One can also define the classes RP \u2286 BPP and CoRP \u2286 BPP of randomized polynomial-time algorithms with one-sided error probability (the difference between the two classes is the side of the error). Nowadays, experts in complexity theory believe that P = RP = CoRP = BPP, i.e. it is believed that randomness does not offer any sort of advantage for the task of solving a problem in polynomial time. The reason for this belief are deep connections between complexity theory, circuit lower bounds, and pseudorandom generators [2, 25, 27] .\nWhile it would be intriguing to attack the conjecture P = BPP directly, it seems very hard to make direct progress in this way. In particular, P = BPP would imply deterministic algorithms for all problems which can be solved with randomness. A more humble approach one can take is to look for one specific problem, where the research community knows a randomized, but no deterministic algorithm, and try to find a deterministic algorithm for this specific problem. Every single of these results can be seen as further evidence towards P = BPP. One famous example of such a 'derandomization' is the deterministic algorithm for primality testing by Agrawal, Kayal and Saxena [1] from 2002.\nQuite interestingly, we only know of a handful of problems where a randomized but no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm is known. This paper is concerned with one of these examples, the Exact Matching problem (Em) . Given an integer k and a simple graph G together with a coloring of its edges in red or blue, Em is the problem of deciding whether G has a perfect matching with exactly k red edges. Em was introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [37] back in 1982. Not too long after its introduction, in 1987, Mulmuley et al. [34] showed that Em can be solved in randomized polynomial-time. Despite the original problem being from 1982, and in spite of multiple applications of Em in different areas (see next paragraph), it is still not known today, if a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm exists.\nAnother interesting aspect of Em is its connection to polynomial identity testing (Pit) .",
        "Sign Languages are the native languages of the Deaf and their main medium of communication. As visual languages, they utilize multiple complementary channels 1 to convey information [62] . This includes manual features, such as hand shape, movement and pose as well as non-manuals features, such as facial expression, mouth and movement of the head, shoulders and torso [5] .\nThe goal of sign language translation is to either convert written language into a video of sign (production) [59, 60] or to extract an equivalent spoken language sentence from a video of someone performing continuous sign [9] . However, in the field of computer vision, much of this latter work 1 Linguists refer to these channels as articulators. has focused on recognising the sequence of sign glosses2 (Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)) rather than the full translation to a spoken language equivalent (Sign Language Translation (SLT)). This distinction is important as the grammar of sign and spoken languages are very different. These differences include (to name a few): different word ordering, multiple channels used to convey concurrent information and the use of direction and space to convey the relationships between objects. Put simply, the mapping between speech and sign is complex and there is no simple word-to-sign mapping. Generating spoken language sentences given sign language videos is therefore a spatio-temporal machine translation task [9] . Such a translation system requires us to accomplish several sub-tasks, which are currently unsolved:\nSign Segmentation: Firstly, the system needs to detect sign sentences, which are commonly formed using topiccomment structures [62] , from continuous sign language videos. This is trivial to achieve for text based machine translation tasks [48] , where the models can use punctuation marks to separate sentences. Speech-based recognition and translation systems, on the other hand, look for pauses, e.g. silent regions, between phonemes to segment spoken language utterances [69, 76] .",
        "Watershed models are frequently used to estimate streamflow and water exchanges among different components of the terrestrial water cycle. These components are affected by a wide range of anthropogenic activities (e.g., agricultural intensification) and climate perturbations (e.g., wildfire, rain-on-snow, rising temperatures and precipitation, earlier snowmelt in mountainous regions). [1] [2] [3] . Watershed models can also assess the sustainability of the water supply for effective water resource management. Some popular and open-source watershed modeling software that can accurately simulate various components of water cycling in intensively managed watersheds include the Soil and Water Assessment Tool SWAT and its variants (e.g., SWAT-MRMT-R) [4] [5] [6] , the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) [7] , the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) [8, 9] , the Weather Research and Forecasting Model Hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) [10, 11] , RHESSys [12] , VIC [13] , MIKE-SHE [14] , DHSVM [15] , and HSPF [16] .\nThe software mentioned above has process models that simulate the watersheds' different hydrological components (e.g., infiltration, groundwater flow, streamflow). Watershed hydrologic models feature two types of parameters [17, 18] . The first type includes parameters with physical significance (e.g., permeability, porosity) [19] that can be determined from observational data. The second type of parameters is conceptual or empirical, which are currently impossible or difficult to measure directly. Most of the watershed simulators mentioned above (e.g., SWAT, PRMS) consist of parameters that fall in the second category [1] . As a result, observational data, such as streamflow collected at the watershed outlet, are used to estimate the conceptual parameters through model calibration. Many watershed models, including the SWAT and PRMS models, can only achieve adequately accurate predictions after calibrating their parameters to available observations, making them less ideal for ungauged watersheds.",
        "As mentioned in [1] , privacy in digital economy is critical, especially for end-users who share their personal data. Differential privacy is a de-facto standard for privacy protection, however, it deteriorates the data utility. This trade-off between privacy and utility is a long standing problem in differential privacy.\nAn intermediate paradigm between the central and the local models of differential privacy (DP), known as the shuffle model [2] , has recently gained popularity. As an initial step, the shuffle model uses a local mechanism to perturb the data individually like the local model of DP. After this local sanitization, a shuffler uniformly permutes the noisy data to dissolve their links with the corresponding data providers. This allows the shuffle model to achieve a certain level of DP guarantee using less noise than the local model ensuring that the shuffle model provides better utility than the local model whilst retaining the same advantages. Thus, the shuffle model has an advantage in the trade-off between privacy and utility for the digital economy.\nThe privacy guarantees provided by the shuffle model have been rigorously studied by community of late and various results have been derived, both analytical and numerical. Obviously, analytical bounds have the advantage that they provide a concrete basis for reasoning and mathematically analysing properties such as privacy-utility trade-off. However, in the case of the shuffle model, most analytical bounds found in the literature are far from being tight. In this paper, we cover this gap and derive tight necessary and sufficient condition for having the tightest (\u01eb, \u03b4)-bounds for the DP guarantee provided by the shuffle model with the k-randomized response (k-RR) local mechanism. We combine the idea of privacy blankets introduced by Balle et al. in [3] and the concept of (\u01eb, \u03b4)adaptive differential privacy (ADP) proposed by Sommer et al. in [4] . Definition 1.1 (Differential privacy [5, 6] ). For a certain query, a randomizing mechanism K taking datasets as input, provides (\u01eb, \u03b4)-differential privacy (DP) if for all neighbouring1 datasets, D 1 and D 2 , and all S \u2286 Range(K), we have [4] ). Let us fix x 0 , x 1 \u2208 X , where X is the alphabet of the original (nonprivatized) data, and let us fix a member u in the dataset. For a certain query, a randomizing mechanism K provides (\u01eb, \u03b4)adaptive differential privacy (ADP) for x 0 and x 1 if for all datasets, D(x 0 ) and D(x 1 ), and all S \u2286 Range(K), we have\nP[K(D 1 ) \u2208 S] \u2264 e \u01eb P[K(D 2 ) \u2208 S] + \u03b4 Definition 1.2 (Adaptive differential privacy\nP[K(D(x 0 )) \u2208 S] \u2264 e \u01eb P[K(D(x 1 ) \u2208 S] + \u03b4\nwhere D(x 0 ) and D(x 1 ) are datasets differing only in the entry of the fixed member u: D(x) means that u reports x for every x \u2208 X , keeping the entries of all the other users the same.

        "With the emergence of deep learning there has been rising concern about the opacity of Artifical Intelligence (AI) systems and their impact on public and private life [Adadi and Berrada, 2018; Guidotti et al., 2018] . Currently, governments are taking steps to protect people's rights, to regulate the AI industry and ensure that these technologies are not abused (e.g., the EU's GDPR [Goodman and Flaxman, 2017] ). Research on eXplainable AI (XAI) tries to address such issues using automated explanations to improve the transparency of black-box models, to audit datasets and ensure fairness, accountability and trustworthiness [Gunning and Aha, 2019; Sokol and Flach, 2019; Birhane et al., 2022] .\nRecently, significant research effort have been expended on counterfactual explanations for XAI [Byrne, 2019; Miller, 2019; Keane et al., 2021; Karimi et al., 2022] ; a recent survey paper reports 350 papers on the topic [Verma et al., 2022] . In this paper, we survey a less-researched special-case of the counterfactual, semi-factual explanations. In this review, we survey the literature on semi-factuals, we define desiderata for this strategy, identify key evaluation metrics and implement baselines to provide a solid base for future work.\nCounterfactuals aim to explain algorithmic decisions in a post-hoc fashion, as an after-the-fact justification. So, in XAI, counterfactuals are typically used to explain what changes to the input-features of an AI system will change the outputdecision. For example, when a customer is refused a loan (i.e., the negative-class outcome for Q in Fig. 1 ), the counterfactual might say \"if you asked for a loan with a shorter term, it would have been approved\" (the red C in Fig. 1 that has a positive-class outcome). Technically, these could be called \"outcome-counterfactuals\" as they capture changes to the world that change the outcome (here, to be consistent with the literature, we will mostly call them \"counterfactuals\").\nSemi-factuals are a special-case of the counterfactual; they differ from outcome-counterfactuals in that they show endusers the feature changes that do not change a decisionoutcome.",
        "In 1952, Claude Shannon presented an electromechanical mouse capable of finding the exit of a maze embedded in a 5 \u00d7 5 grid. The device was baptised 'Theseus' in reference to the mythical hero who must escape an inextricable labyrinth after having killed the ferocious Minotaur. Shannon's mouse is arguably the first autonomous mobile device Klein [2018] , it inspired a number of micro-mouse competitions globally.\nThe navigation algorithm used by Shannon's mouse is known today as 'depth-first search'. Its analysis dates back to Lucas [1883] , making it one of the few algorithms which preceded the era of computer science.\nDepth-first search generalizes the ancient maze-solving heuristic 'right-hand-on-the-wall' which can be used in the absence of cycles, i.e. for trees. Given the ability to mark previously explored nodes (e.g. with a chalk), an agent using depth-first search is guaranteed to traverse each edge once in both directions and then return to the origin. In modern terms, we say it achieves graph exploration in 2m moves, where m is the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm is optimal in the sense of competitive analysis Miyazaki et al. [2009] .\nMain results. In the myth, Theseus can count on the help of the ingenious Ariadne. In this paper, we start by studying the question of whether two agents initially located at the same node can solve a maze faster than a single agent. We answer by the affirmative using the formalism of collective exploration introduced by Fraigniaud et al. [2006] . Specifically, our main contribution to this problem is a collective graph exploration algorithm for two agents which requires exactly m timesteps to explore any tree with m edges.",
        "Typical supervised learning problems assume that each training sample in the dataset has a label, and the classifier can be trained by using the label as instance level supervise signal. However, in many practical scenarios, getting instance level labels can be difficult due to the high complexity and intensive labor for labeling each individual instance. In these cases, a label is assigned to a group of instances instead. This problem is called multi-instance learning (MIL) [3] . For example, in whole slide image (WSI) [5, 7] analysis, the images can have tremendously large dimensions but usually the whole image is assigned with a single label while region-level annotation is seldom given [2] .\nRecently, Ilse et al. [8] introduced the Attention-based MIL model fully parameterized by neural networks. The aggregation operator as well as the feature extractor are end-to-end trainable and can aggregation instance embeddings to a bag embedding. The attention-mechanism used in the model assigns an attention score to each of the instance embeddings, and the final classifier operates on a bag embedding which is a gated-sum of the instance embeddings. The attention score reflect how much an instance is likely to be the key instance that trigger the bag classifier. Later on, [14, 18, 12] proposed to use self-attention mechanism [17] to further consider the the dependencies between instance embeddings. However, computing the self-attention matrix across all instance embeddings in a bag is computationally complex and might yield redundant information that does not contributes useful supervising signal. More importantly, both of the MIL models can have difficulties to solve clinical WSI image classification problems in practical scenarios where the WSIs produce tens of thousands of patches. The memory requirement for training a deep CNNbased feature extractor as well as the following aggregation operator requires gradients to flow through the CNN of all patches, which prohibits the training of the bag embeddingbased model.\nIn this paper, we show that the cross matching of all queries in self-attention for MIL is sub-optimal, and a matching using only the top-activated queries does not only reduce the computational complexity but also improves the classification performance. we propose a novel dual-stream MIL (DSMIL) model parameterized by neural networks that jointly learns an instance classifier and a bag classifier. The first stream of the model deploys a standard MIL max pooling, which determines the top-activated embeddings. In the second stream, the attention score is computed across the instances by correlating only the top-activated queries with the instances in the bag.",
        "Consider estimating an unknown parameter \u03b8 \u2208 R 10 from a single measurement Y \u223c N (\u03b8, I 10 ). Suppose that the observed data is Y = [1.08, -2.43, 1.52, -1.17, 1.39, 8.3, 10.02, 10.61, 9.3, 10.14] .\nAlthough the worst-case reasoning suggests simply using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) \u03b8 = Y , it is well-known by now that it is often advantageous to use shrinkage estimators, such as James-Stein. However, in the example shown,1 it should also be clear that applying the James-Stein estimator on the first 5 coordinates and the rest separately would be even more advantageous since shrinking to a common mean of all 10 coordinates (in this bimodal situation) appears unnatural. How can one formalize derivation of such clever procedures and how can one study their fundamental limits? Both of these questions were addressed in a decision-theoretic framework proposed by Robbins [Rob51, Rob56] under the name of empirical Bayes. Since then a lot has been written about this paradigm and empirical Bayes methodology has been widely used in practice for large-scale data analysis, with notable applications in computational biology especially microarrays [ETST01] , sports prediction [Bro08] , etc. We refer to the survey articles [Cas85, Zha03, Efr21] and the monograph [Efr12] for theory and methodology for empirical Bayes.",
        "Mobility analysis, or understanding and modeling of people's mobility patterns in terms of when, where, and how people move from one place to another is fundamentally important. Such information is not only important for answering many scientific inquiries regarding how people interact with urban spaces and with each other, but also as a basis for many large-or mega-scale investment decisions on the nation's multi-modal transportation infrastructure. For decades, information on people's mobility patterns has been obtained from self-reported household travel surveys where randomly-selected respondents are asked to report all of their travel on one or two pre-determined travel survey days (Stopher and Greaves, 2007) . Travel surveys, though providing rich information, are expensive (about $250-350 per household), and have relatively small sample sizes (typically ~0.1% of the region's population for urbanized areas). Because household travel surveys are conducted rather infrequently (once every few years), they are unsuitable for answering questions relating to how mobility patterns evolve over time or change after events.\nThe past two decades have seen a surge of studies using data from mobile devices to analyze individuals' mobility patterns (Chen et al., 2016) . Such data often contains a large number of individuals (from hundreds of thousands to millions) while covering a sustained time period (from weeks to months and years). This data has two key pieces of information: the geographical locations (often expressed in longitude and latitude) where individual mobile devices are observed on the network, and the associated time when they are observed. Based on these two pieces of information, individuals' mobility patterns, in terms of when and where they go from one place to another, can be inferred.",

        "With the rapid advancement of medical digitalization, an abundance of medical documentation is being generated, encompassing electronic medical records, medical reports, and various other forms. The extraction of medical information, notably medical named entity recognition (NER), garners increasing significance in applications such as knowledge graph construction, question-answering systems, and automated analysis of electronic medical records. Medical NER aims to automatically identify medical entities, including but not limited to body (bod), disease (dis), clinical symptom (sym), medical procedure (pro), medical equipment (equ), drug (dru), and medical examination item (ite), from medical texts.\nThese entities often exhibit lengthy, nested structured, and polysemous, thus presenting considerable challenges to the task of medical NER. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 , the three entities \"\u8ff7\u8d70\u795e\u7ecf\" (vagus nerve), \"\u820c\u54bd\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\" (glossopharyngeal nucleus) and \"\u820c\u4e0b\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\" (hypoglossal nucleus), denoted as \"bod\", are nested within the entity \"\u8ff7\u8d70\u795e\u7ecf\u3001\u820c\u54bd\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u53ca\u820c\u4e0b\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u53d7\u635f \u4f24\"(the injury of vagus nerve, glossopharyngeal nucleus and hypoglossal nucleus), denoted as \"sym\".\nTo address the challenge of nested NER, we adopt a strategy similar to Li et al. (2020b) and Du et al. (2022) , by framing NER as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) task. Like Li et al. (2022) , we employ an approach that combines the strengths of both Biaffine and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) predictors through joint prediction. Additionally, we introduce a task-adaptive pre-training strategy to fine-tune the original pre-trained model specifically for medical NER. Our model incorporates several techniques, including Conditional Layer Normalization (CLN), weighted layer fusion, word-pair embeddings, and multi-granularity dilated convolution, all of which have been demonstrated to improve performance.",
        "The objective of this paper is to propose and analyze new risk-averse reinforcement learning methods for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our goal is to combine the efficacy of the methods of temporal differences with the robustness of dynamic risk measures, and to provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of the methods.\nMDPs are well-known models of stochastic sequential decision problems, covered in multiple monographs [5, 32, 55, 7] , and having countless applications. In the classical setting, the goal of an MDP is to find a policy minimizing the expected cost over a finite or infinite horizon. Traditional MDP models, although effective for small to medium size problems, suffer from the curse of dimensionality in problems with large state space. Approximate dynamic programming approaches try to tackle the curse of dimensionality and provide an approximate solution of an MDP (see [52] for an overview). Such methods usually involve value function approximations, where the value of a state of the Markov process is approximated by a simple, usually linear, function of some selected features of the state [6] .\nReinforcement learning methods [67, 52] involve simulation or observation of a Markov process to approximate the value function and learn the corresponding policies. The first studies attempted to emulate neural networks and biological learning processes, learning by trial and error [46, 27] . Some learning algorithms, such as Q-Learning [73, 74] and SARSA [59] , follow this idea. One of core approaches in reinforcement learning is the method of temporal differences [66] , known as TD(\u03bb ). It uses differences between the values of the approximate value function at successive states to improve the approximation, concurrently with the evolution of the system. TD(\u03bb ) is a continuum of algorithms depending on a parameter \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] which is used to exponentially weight past observations. Consequently, related methods such as Q(\u03bb ) [73, 49, 50, 58] and SARSA(\u03bb ) were developed [59, 58] . The methods of temporal differences have been proven to converge in the mean in [19] and almost surely by several studies, with different degrees of generality and precision [49, 20, 71, 34, 72] .\nWe introduce risk models into temporal difference learning.

        "Corporations today collect their customers' private information to train Machine Learning models that power a variety of services like recommendations, searches, targeted ads, etc. To prevent any unintended use of personal data, privacy policies, such as the General Data Protection Regulation [14] (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act [6] (CCPA), require that these corporations provide the \"Right to be Forgotten\" (RTBF) to their usersif a user wishes to revoke access to their data, an organization must comply by erasing all information about her without undue delay (typically a month). Critically, models trained in standard ways are susceptible to model inversion [13] and membership inference attacks [31] , demonstrating that training data can be exfiltrated from these models.\nPeriodic retraining of models after excluding deleted users can be computationally expensive. Consequently, there is a growing interest in designing computationally cheap Machine Unlearning algorithms as an alternative to retraining for erasing the influence of deleted data from trained models. Since it is generally difficult to tell how a specific data point affects a model, Ginart et al. [15] propose quantifying the worst-case information leakage from an unlearned model through an unlearning guarantee on the mechanism, defined as a differential privacy (DP) like (\u03b5, \u03b4)-indistinguishability between its output and that of retraining on the updated database. With some minor variations in this definition, several mechanisms have been proposed and certified as unlearning algorithms in literature [15, 20, 30, 24, 17, 32] .\nHowever, is indistinguishability to retraining a sufficient guarantee of deletion privacy? We argue that it is not. In the real world, a user's decision to remove his information is often affected by what a deployed model reveals about him. Unfortunately, the same revealed information may also affect other users' decisions. Such adaptive requests make the records in a database interdependent. For instance, if an individual is identified to be part of the training set, many members of his group may request deletion. Therefore, the representation of different groups in the unlearned model can reveal the individual's affiliation, even when he is no longer part of the dataset. We demonstrate on mechanism certified under existing unlearning guarantees, including Gupta et al. [18] 's adaptive unlearning, that the identity of the target record can be inferred from the unlearned model when requests are adaptive. Since it is possible that adaptive deletion requests can encode patterns specific to a target record in the curator's database, we argue that any deletion privacy certification via indistinguishability to retraining, as done in all prior unlearning definitions, is fundamentally flawed.\nIs an unlearning guarantee a sound and complete measure of deletion privacy when requests are non-adaptive? Again, we argue that it is neither. A sound deletion privacy guarantee must ensure the non-recovery of deleted records from an infinite number of model releases after deletion. However, approximate indistinguishability to retraining implies an inability to accurately recover deleted data from a singular unlearned model only, which we argue is not sufficient. We show that certain algorithms can satisfy an unlearning guarantee yet blatantly reveal the deleted data eventually over multiple releases. The vulnerability arises in algorithms that maintain partial computations in internal data-dependent states for speeding up subsequent deletions. These internal states can retain information even after record deletion and influence multiple future releases, making the myopic unlearning guarantee unreliable in sequential deletion settings. Several proposed unlearning algorithms in literature [24, 18] are stateful (rely on internal states) and, therefore, cannot be trusted. Secondly, existing unlearning definitions are incomplete notions of deletion privacy they exclude valid deletion mechanisms that do not imitate retraining. For instance, a (useless) mechanism that outputs a fixed untrained model on any request is a valid deletion algorithm. However, since its output is easily distinguishable from retraining, it fails to satisfy these unlearning guarantees.\nThis paper proposes a sound definition of data-deletion that does not suffer from the aforementioned shortcomings. Under our paradigm, a data-deletion mechanism is reliable if A) it is stateless, i.e., does not rely on any secret states that may be influenced by previously deleted records; and B) it generates models that are indistinguishable from some deleted record independent random variable. Statelessness thwarts the danger of sustained information leakage through internal data structures after deletion. Moreover, by measuring its deletion privacy via indistinguishability with any deleted-record independent random variable, as opposed to the output of retraining, we ensure reliability in presence of adaptive requests that can create dependence between current and deleted records in the database.\nIn general, we show that under adaptive requests, any data-deletion mechanism must be privacy-preserving with respect to existing records to ensure the privacy of deleted records. Privacy with respect to existing records is necessary to prevent adaptive requests from creating any unwanted correlations among present and absent database entries that prevents deletion of records in an information theoretic sense. We also prove that if a mechanism is differentially private with respect to the existing records and satisfies our data-deletion guarantee under non-adaptive edit requests, then it also satisfies a data-deletion guarantee under adaptive requests. That is, we prove a general reduction for our sound data-deletion guarantee under non-adaptive requests to adaptive requests when the unlearning mechanism is differentially private with respect to records not being deleted. We emphasize that we are not advocating for doing data deletion through differentially-private mechanisms simply because it caps the information content of all records equally, deleted or otherwise. Instead, a data-deletion mechanism should provide two differing information reattainment bounds; one for records currently in the database in the form of a differential privacy guarantee, and the other for records previously deleted in the form of a non-adaptive data-deletion guarantee, as these two information bounds together ensure deletion privacy under adaptive requests as well.\nBased on our findings, we redefine the problem of data-deletion as designing a mechanism that (1.) satisfies a data-deletion guarantee against non-adaptive deletion requests, (2.) is differentially private for remaining records, and (3.) has the same utility guarantee as retraining under identical differential privacy constraints. On top of these objectives, a datadeletion mechanism must also be computationally cheaper than retraining for being useful. We propose a data-deletion solution based on Noisy Gradient Descent (Noisy-GD), a popular differentially private learning algorithm [3, 1] , and show that our solution satisfies all the three objectives while providing substantial computational savings for both convex and non-convex losses. Our solution demonstrates a powerful synergy between data deletion and differential privacy as the same noise needed for the privacy of records present in the database also rapidly erases information regarding records deleted from the database. For convex and smooth losses, we certify that under a (q, \u03b5 dd )-R\u00e9nyi data-deletion and (q, \u03b5 dp )-R\u00e9nyi DP constraint, our Noisy-GD based deletion mechanism for d-dimensional models over n-sized databases with requests that modify no more than r records can maintain a tight optimal excess empirical risk of the order O qd \u03b5 dp n 2 while being \u2126(n log(min{ n r , n \u03b5 dd qd }) cheaper than retraining in gradient complexity.",
        "Text embeddings are an important tool for a variety of NLP tasks. They provide a general and compute efficient solution to problems like topic classification, document clustering, text mining and information retrieval, among others.\nMost modern techniques to learn text embeddings rely on minimizing a contrastive loss (Chopra et al., 2005; van den Oord et al., 2019) . This requires identifying, for each example x in the training set, a positive example x + and a set of negative examples x - i associated to x. The choice of x + and x - i is one of the main factors differentiating these techniques. Unsupervised methods (Zhang et al., 2020; Giorgi et al., 2021; Chuang et al., 2022) rely on in-batch negatives for the x - i and data augmentation for x + . Supervised or weakly supervised methods (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019; Ni et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2022; Su et al., 2022; Muennighoff, 2022; Ni et al., 2022a) rely either on mining heuristics or annotated datasets to build the positive and negative pairs, for instance a common choice is to use entailment and contradiction pairs * Alphabetical order respectively, as in SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015a) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2018a) .\nIn this work we approach the problem of learning text embedding from the point of view of which objective function to use. We consider two selfsupervised representation learning algorithms introduced in the computer vision literature: Barlow Twins (BT) (Zbontar et al., 2021) and VI-CReg (Bardes et al., 2022) .\nWhat teases apart these two methods is their nature of being dimension contrastive according to the classification of Garrido et al. (2022) : while the usual contrastive method, defined by Garrido et al. (2022) as sample contrastive, avoids the collapse of the learned representations by penalizing similarity of the embeddings corresponding to different data points, dimension contrastive methods regularize the objective function by de-correlating the embeddings across their dimensions. Both sample and dimension contrastive methods rely on data augmentation in the unsupervised setting.",
        "Myocardial strain has demonstrated its significance in identifying LMA regions for an optimized pacing site for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) [1, 2] . The quantification of myocardial strains can be achieved through various specialized imaging techniques that offer information of ventricular deformation patterns and cardiac motion abnormalities from MR images. Commonly used methods include MR tagging [3] , cine SSFP with feature tracking (FT) [4, 5, 6, 7] , and cine DENSE [8] , with DENSE standing out for its high accuracy in capturing myocardial deformations [9] . Despite the advantages of DENSE, its widespread clinical use is hindered by limited accessibility, primarily due to the high-cost facilities and specialized expertise required for image collection and analysis. Many clinical centers often opt for cine FT. However, the accuracy of FT is compromised by inherent limitations in image quality, including low spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, these registration-based tracking algorithms focus solely on motions along contours [10] .\nRecent research has explored the application of deep learning to enhance the accuracy of predicting myocardial motion from cine images, guided by the supervision of DENSE [11] . In this study, the authors employed a neural network to capture the intricate relationship between a time sequence of left ventricular (LV) myocardium segmented from DENSE, and the corresponding encoded displacement fields. By assuming a minimal domain gap between cine and DENSE segmentations in predicting displacement fields, the researchers directly evaluated the trained model on cine input.\nInspired by [11] , this paper introduces a multimodal deep learning method that for the first time leverages DENSE to guide the analysis of cine CMRs for an improved LMA detection. Using DENSE strain as ground truth data, we develop an end-to-end joint learning framework that predicts LMA regions (measured by the onset of circumferential shortening (TOS) of segmental myocardial regions [12] ) from cine images. Our framework includes two main components: (i) a registration-based strain network to predict the myocardium strain using the learned latent motion/deformation features from cine images, and (ii) a LMA network to predict TOS based on the learned strains.",
        "1.1. Problem overview. Model uncertainty is an essential part of mathematical modelling but is particularly acute in mathematical finance and economics where one cannot base models on well established physical laws. Until recently, these models were mostly conceived in a three step fashion: 1) gathering statistical properties of the underlying time-series or the so called stylized facts; 2) handcrafting a parsimonious model, which would best capture the desired market characteristics without adding any needless complexity and 3) calibration and validation of the handcrafted model. Indeed, model complexity was undesirable, amongst other reasons, for increasing the computational effort required to perform in particular calibration but also pricing and using tools from martingale optimal transport which also, through dual representation, yields corresponding super-and sub-hedging strategies, [Beiglb\u00f6ck et al., 2013] . Without imposing further constrains, the class of all calibrated models M might be too large and consequently the corresponding bounds too wide to be of practical use [Eckstein et al., 2019] . See however an effort to incorporate further market information to tighten the pricing interval, [Nadtochiy and Obloj, 2017, Aksamit et al., 2020] . Another shortcoming of working with the entire class of calibrated models M is that, in general, it is not clear how to obtain a practical/explicit model out of the measures that yields price bounds. For example, such explicit models are useful when one wants consistently calibrate under pricing measure Q and real-world measure P as needed for risk estimation and stress testing, [Broadie et al., 2011, Pelsser and Schweizer, 2016] or learn hedging strategies in the presence of transactional cost and an illiquidity constrains [Buehler et al., 2019] .\n1.2.

        "Softwarization of computer networks has enabled efficient ways to deploy and manage services with flexibility and reconfigurability. For example, hardware-based network functions can now be replaced with virtual network functions to release constraints related to hardware. In addition, cloud computing with software-based networks enables service providers to utilize computing resources for service management in data centers more efficiently [1] .\nMeanwhile, the number of network devices and linkages has grown over the years [2] , and the softwarization of computer networks also has increased the number of services provided through virtual networks. The increased complexity and size of the network introduced problems of quality degradation and inconsistency in service availability. This extension in the network size poses a severe management challenge [1] , [2] .\nAs service providers are aware that they need to provide dependable service, they are interested in a data-driven approach for virtual network management, combining big data and machine learning (ML) to manage large-scale networks with complex dependencies efficiently. Among much prior work in this line of research [3] , [4] , [5] , one of the vital network management techniques is anomaly detection, in which the quality of service is preserved by quickly responding to a system that shows out-of-normal behavior.\nRelated to ML-based anomaly detection for virtual network functions (VNFs), previous works trained ML models with data collected from an operating system (OS) or hypervisor of virtual machines (VMs) [1] , [6] , [7] . For example, in [1] , they collected a dataset and applied methods such as decision tree-based gradient boosting machine (GBM), XGBoost, and deep neural networks (DNNs) to detect anomalous cases from the normal ones.\nHowever, these methods have not utilized sequential information over the VNF sequence, which should be helpful for anomaly detection as VNF instances are arranged in sequence over which network traffic passes [8] . In addition, if services require different compositions of SFCs, including type, order, and the number of VNF instances, existing approaches had to train separate models, especially when the number of VNF instances is different because of the discrepancy in input dimension. Furthermore, they have not employed temporal information over time-series of monitoring data, which should be helpful if occurrences of abnormality follow temporal patterns as in Figure 1 .\nTo learn sequential information over the VNF sequence, we apply uni and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (Uni-and Bi-RNNs) and Transformer. As the sequential architectures can take a variable-length input sequence, our proposed models are compatible with data from SFCs with different numbers of VNFs. Such compatibility allows the capacity of joint training (or training simultaneously) over data from different SFCs.",
        "Despite the enormous success of deep learning in numerous disciplines, widespread adoption of the technology is still inhibited by its lack of transparency: It is generally difficult to explain the decision-making process of a deep neural model, especially to the model's end-user. One promising approach is the generation of natural language explanations (NLEs) [5] , which provide an intuitively understandable rationalization of a neural network's decision. Due to the growing need to integrate multi-modal information, such as vision and language, recent research has increasingly focused on generating natural language explanations for vision-language tasks (VL-NLE) [8, 17, 26, 31, 38] .\nHowever, existing VL-NLE models suffer from at least one of the following issues: First, the models incorporate separate answer prediction and NLE generation modules (e.g., FME [31] , e-UG [17] ), which leads to inferior NLE generation performance due to the loose integration between the two modules. Second, their backbone models are often pretrained on a limited set of tasks (e.g., VL-T5 [29] ), not fully exploiting the potential of multi-task learning with a unified architecture. Third, they incorporate ad hoc solutions using additional task-specific modules or additional resources to increase their performance on the datasets at hand (e.g., NLX-GPT [38] , RExC [26] ), which does not allow them to be used as omnipotent models, a vision of current AI research [35, 43] .\nTo overcome the mentioned issues, we propose to utilize recent advances in large-scale multi-task pre-training of generative vision-language models on VL-NLE tasks. Our assumption is that training on a broad range of diverse tasks enables learning the commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities necessary to generate complex and accurate NLEs. We fine-tune the recently presented OFA model [43] , a generative Transformer pretrained on a diverse set of multimodal and uni-modal tasks, to each target NLE task. We show that a single unified architecture that is not pretrained to generate explanations and without any task-specific modifications and optimizations reaches state-of-the-art performance in the e-SNLI-VE and VQA-X datasets. The generated explanations received higher average ratings by human annotators than the ground-truth explanations on e-SNLI-VE while also being preferred in a direct A-B comparison on both e- Example tasks from the datasets VQA-X [31] , e-SNLI-VE [17] , and VCR [47] .\nSNLI-VE and VQA-X.

        "The demand of large deep learning (DL) models is surging in recent years as they demonstrate dominating model accuracy * Part of the work done while interning at Amazon. \u2020 Work done while at Amazon. on a range of tasks in natural language processing (NLP) [3, 5, 10, 12] and computer vision [13, 33, 65] . These models are normally invented in user-friendly DL frameworks like PyTorch [41] with dynamic model graphs 1 , which by design lacks sufficient optimization for high-performance execution. This issue becomes more and more critical as the size of models grows exponentially and so does the time of training.\nIn order to reduce the model training time, developers propose various kinds of optimization. The first type of optimization is implemented manually in different layers of model training, such as inserting high-performance kernels [11, 28, 40, 54] for computationally intensive operators on specific devices (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs), employing data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism [37, 49, 54] , as well as activation checkpointing [8, 21, 25] , to efficiently distribute the training across multiple devices. However, manual optimization introduces the following two challenges. Challenge 1: Generality -Incorporating the above optimizations requires making intrusive changes to the model implementation, which means that the optimization is not easy to generalize to other models. A new model, even with minimal change from the old one, may not be able to directly reuse the old optimization. In addition, the optimized model becomes platform-specific, requiring developers to maintain multiple implementations to serve all requirements (e.g., training on different platforms and deploying on non-GPU devices). Challenge 2: Ease of Tuning -In practice, an optimization scheme has a number of configurations to tune (e.g., pipeline stages, number of activation checkpoints) to get a combination that results in the best performance. Developers need to identify tunable configurations in the implementation and modify the model to expose them for effective tuning. This process can be tedious and error-prone especially when the model definition is closely tied to optimizations.\nIn addition to manual optimization, the other set of optimization approaches converts the DL model into a number of static graphs and leverages DL compilers to automatically apply optimizations. For example, JAX [4] is a DL framework powered by a compiler XLA [18] . JAX traces the entire model to obtain a whole graph statically, on top of which the compiler can perform aggressive optimizations such as operator fusion, expression simplification, and even 3D parallelism [70] . Similarly, the recent release PyTorch 2.0 [42] provides a compiler interface to trace PyTorch dynamic graph executions and construct static graphs in torch.fx [51] for optimizations. While automatic optimization requires minimal engineering effort from model developers and addresses some of the challenges mentioned above, it also introduces two new challenges. Challenge 3: Programmability -Working on static model graphs is limited by the requirement that everything must be statically analyzable and deterministic. Frameworks may impose constraints on the users to facilitate the conversion to static graphs. For example, JAX programming model requires pure Python functions, no in-place updates, etc., so developers may need to rewrite the model to meet these constraints in order to make it runnable [4] . For another example, Py-Torch 2.0 cannot trace through the collective operators like all_reduce which are essential for distributed training [42] . Moreover, it is usually non-trivial for developers to control or configure the optimizations in fine granularity, such as disabling certain rules, or excluding certain operators from a compiler pass. Challenge 4: Debuggability -To make model implementation easy to understand and maintain, model developers usually implement layer modules (e.g., convolutional, fully connected, and attention layers) as building blocks, and use them to compose a model hierarchically.",
        "The advancement of digital imaging technology, from early monochromatic photography to modern 8k resolution, plays a pivotal role in various fields, including medical diagnostics, where image clarity is essential [1] .

        "Business processes underpin a large number of enterprise operations including loan origination, invoice management, and insurance claims processing (Van Der Aalst and others 2011). The business process management (BPM) industry is expected to approach $16 billion by 2023 (Marketwatch 2019). There is a great opportunity for infusing AI to reduce cost or provide better customer experience (Rao and Verweij 2017) , and the BPM literature is rich in machine learning solutions to gain insights on clusters of process traces (Nguyen et al. 2016; Nguyen et al. 2019) , predict outcomes (Breuker et al. 2016) , and recommend decisions (Mannhardt et al. 2016) .

There has been little attention paid to explaining model predictions to business users with process context. These business users are typically experts in their fields but not data scientists, and explanations must be presented in their business domain vocabulary. We challenge the BPM community to build on the AI interpretability literature, and the AI Trust community to take advantage of business process artifacts.",
        "Person re-identification is a popular computer vision task, where the goal is to find a person, given in a query image, from the search over a large set of gallery images. In the last two years, generalizable person re-identification has gain increasing attention due to both its research and practical value [12, 13, 18, 22, 27, 47, 49] . This task studies the generalizability of a learned person re-identification model in unseen scenarios, and employs direct cross-dataset evaluation [10, 39] for performance benchmarking.\nFor deep metric learning, beyond feature representation learning and loss designs, explicit deep feature matching schemes are shown to be effective for matching person images [1, 15, 18, 25, 29] , due to the advantages in addressing pose and viewpoint changes, occlusions, and misalignments. In particular, a recent method, called query-adaptive convolution (QAConv) [18] , has proved that explicit convolutional matching between gallery and query feature maps is quite effective for generalizable person re-identification. However, these methods all require more computational costs compared to conventional feature learning methods.\nBeyond novel generalizable algorithms, another way to improve generalization is to enlarge the scale and diversity of the training data. For example, a recent dataset called RandPerson [34] synthesized 8,000 identities, while [32] and [2] both collected 30K persons for re-identification training. These studies all observed improved generalization ability for person re-identification. However, the efficiency of deep metric learning from large-scale data has not yet been adequately studied in person re-identification.\nThere are some popular ways of learning deep person re-identification models, including classification (with the ID loss [44] ), metric learning (with a pairwise loss [5, 39] or triplet loss [9] ), and their combinations (e.g. ID + triplet loss). Using an ID loss is convenient for classification learning. However, in large-scale deep learning, involving classifier parameters incurs large memory and computational costs in both the forward and backward passes. Similarly, arXiv:2104.01546v4 [cs.CV] 6 Apr 2022 involving class signatures for metric learning in a global view is also not efficient. For example, QAConv in [18] is difficult to scale up for large-scale training, because a class memory module is designed, where full feature maps are stored for all classes as signatures, and they are required for cross feature map convolutional matching during training.\nTherefore, involving class parameters or signatures in either classification or metric learning is not efficient for large-scale person re-identification training. In contrast, we consider that pairwise deep metric learning between samples in mini batches is better suited for this task. Accordingly, the batch sampler plays an important role for efficient learning [9, 38] . The well-known PK sampler [9, 23] is the most popular random sampling method in person reidentification.",
        "Computer fonts are widely used in our daily lives. The legibility and aesthetic of fonts adopted in books, posters, advertisements, etc., are critical for their producers during the designing procedures. Thereby, the demands for highquality fonts in various styles have increased rapidly. However, font design is a creative and time-consuming task, especially for font libraries consisting of large amounts of characters (e.g., Chinese). For example, the official character set GB18030-2000 consists of 27533 Chinese characters, most of which have complicated structures and contain dozens of strokes [1] . Designing or writing out such large amounts of complex glyphs in a consistent style is time-consuming and costly. Thus, more and more researchers and companies are interested in developing systems that can automatically generate high-quality Chinese fonts from a few input samples.\nWith the help of various neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs and RNNs), researchers have proposed many DL-based methods for Chinese font synthesis. DL-based methods aim to model the relationship between input and output data (outlines, glyph images, or writing trajectories). Most of them are CNN-based models, such as zi2zi [2] , EMD [3] , and SCFont [4] . Intuitively, we can represent a glyph as the combination of a writing trajectory and a stroke rendering style. Thus, there are some RNN-based methods (e.g., FontRNN [5] ) synthesizing the writing trajectory for each Chinese character. Despite the great progress made in the last few years, most existing approaches still need large amounts of offline or online glyph images to train the font synthesis models. Moreover, the quality of vector outlines/glyph images synthesized by those methods is often unsatisfactory, especially when the desired font is in a cursive style or the number of input samples is too small. The design of our FontTransformer is motivated by the observation that a Chinese character is typically rendered as a glyph image when it is composed of sequential strokes in essence.",
        "In neutral atom quantum computers, typically, the way of extracting information from the system is through fluorescence imaging [1] . An electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera takes an image of the array of atoms and a reconstruction algorithm then analyzes the image to detect the occupancy of each potential atom site. An example of such an image can be seen in Fig. 1a . However, no ground truth exists for all images taken on real systems and the only means of knowing about the state of the system is to trust the reconstruction algorithm.\nWhen imaging the experiment, Poissonian-distributed photoelectrons from atomic fluorescence compete with stochastically distributed electrons from camera noise of various origins. In a performance-tuned quantum computer, the qubit readout time is minimized and so only few fluorescence photons per atom can be collected. The aforementioned competition between photoelectrons and noise electrons radically reduces our confidence in determining whether a site contains an atom or not, and with that our confidence in the final image analysis.\nThis problem is further intensified by the potential loss of atoms during the imaging process if it is not tuned perfectly. The sites of these lost atoms look like normal occupied sites with all the characteristics of an atom, except their effective exposure time may assume any value between \"no time at all\" and \"the full exposure time\". There may, therefore, be a continuous transition between the brightness of unoccupied and occupied sites. At the end, though, the only noteworthy metric is whether a site is occupied after taking the image, which is a binary decision. While this can be enhanced by taking consecutive images, these again lack certainty. Sites that are inherently dimmer or appear dimmer by chance might be omitted from testing on real data, despite being the most interesting ones, since assumptions about their occupancy are probabilistic.\nOptimized detection algorithms are required to increase detection fidelity under these challenging experimental conditions, but their design and training requires labeled data with absolute knowledge of atomic presence or absence to evaluate their performance accurately, which we cannot gain from real-world experiments. In this work, we, therefore, propose a different way of generating artificial images with realistic properties directly from the corresponding ground 979-8-3503-4323-6/23/$31.oo \u00a92023 IEEE.

Since the process of image formation, considering influences from both photoelectrons and noise electrons, is well understood, we can produce atomic fluorescence pictures that are practically indistinguishable from real ones. As a second benefit, the simulated pictures can also be calculated much faster than real ones can be obtained experimentally, allowing for rapid development and training on top of our simulator. Fig. 1b shows such a simulated image.\nSince the simulation output comes with absolute truth of occupancy, from which it was created, it can be used to benchmark detection algorithms accurately by comparing the reconstructed state to the original one. However, one needs to have trust in the simulator's capabilities of producing accurate images.",

        "As mathematical models of biological systems improve, they are increasingly used to design systems for a particular purpose. Our motivating example is the creation of bespoke networks of interacting biomolecules that respond to changes of input concentrations as logic gates (e.g. AND or OR). These can be used to create biosensors [1] , targeted drug delivery [2] , and tunable genetic circuits [3] . Due to discrepancies between the predictions of the mathematical model and biological reality, each network has to be validated experimentally before use to verify that the real-world system exhibits the desired response. In the context of verifying many networks, the cost of these experiments becomes large. In this work, we propose a method for verifying whether the true response of the network is suitably similar to that which is desired.\nThe response of biomolecular networks have been validated before [1, 4, 5] , by running experiments at a fixed predetermined set of input points that were deemed important for the application. The number of points was chosen to satisfy the experimenter that the surfaces were similar. A similar, but significantly different problem, is investigated in the surrogate modeling literature, where it is also important to understand the discrepancy between experimental data and a true reference [6, 7, 8, 9] . We take inspiration from these methods in (1) modeling the discrepancy so the observed data informs our prediction of the discrepancy over the entire surface and (2) using the discrepancy model to intelligently determine the next experiment to run.",
        "Harvesting ocean waves energy has become more prominent since the oil crisis in 1973. Ocean energy has huge potential in providing energy especially for coastal communities, which made the governments, industries and engineers very attracted to this matter and resulted in more than 1000 patents worldwide [1, 2] . Wave energy has immense reserves, high power potential, higher power density than solar and wind energy, is geographically diverse and makes small interference in the environment [3, 4] .\nOne of the key parts of a WEC is the power take-off system which converts the mechanical energy absorbed by the device into electrical energy [5, 3] . Since the wave energy is fluctuating by nature, regular PTOs are not very effective at absorbing wave power [i31] . The development of hydraulic PTO systems has been a huge breakthrough in the field of ocean energy applications, due to the fast-frequency response, easy and high controllability, high efficiency, hydraulic overload protection, and adaptability to high power and low-frequency of the HPTO systems [5, 3, 6] . These characteristics made HPTO the best PTO type for the point absorber wave energy devices, which can reach up to 90% efficiency [6] . There has been an increasing number of studies about the HPTO application in different WECs in recent years [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] , but the number of studies is still lower than the studies WECs with Linear PTO, and there are a lot of unexplored areas that need to be addressed in the future. Most of these studies investigated the performance and efficiency of the HPTO systems, but they did not consider the effect of HPTO model parameters. These parameters are really important because they affect the unit's efficiency and power output. Only a small number of studies addressed this problem, especially the effect of simultaneous change in the HPTO parameters has been investigated in very few studies, for example in [12, 6] .",
        "High-capacity neural networks trained on large, diverse datasets have led to remarkable models that can solve numerous tasks, rapidly adapt to new tasks, and produce general-purpose representations in NLP and vision (Brown et al., 2020; He et al., 2021) . The promise of offline RL is to leverage these advances to produce polices with broad generalization, emergent capabilities, and performance that exceeds the capabilities demonstrated in the training dataset. Thus far, the only offline RL approaches that demonstrate broadly generalizing policies and transferable representations are heavily-based on supervised learning (Reed et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022) . However, these approaches are likely to perform poorly when the dataset does not contain expert trajectories (Kumar et al., 2021b) .\nOffline Q-learning performs well across dataset compositions in a variety of simulated (Gulcehre et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020) and real-world domains (Chebotar et al., 2021; Soares et al., 2021) , however, these are largely centered around small-scale, single-task problems where broad generalization and learning general-purpose representations is not expected. Scaling these methods up to high-capcity models on large, diverse datasets is the critical challenge. Prior works hint at the difficulties: on small-scale, single-task deep RL benchmarks, scaling model capacity can lead to instabilities or degrade performance (Van Hasselt et al., 2018; Sinha et al., 2020; Ota et al., 2021) explaining why decade-old tiny 3-layer CNN architectures (Mnih et al., 2013) are still prevalent. Moreover, works that have scaled architectures to millions of parameters (Espeholt et al., 2018; Teh et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2019; Schrittwieser et al., 2021) typically focus on online learning and employ many sophisticated techniques to stabilize learning, such as supervised auxiliary losses, distillation, and Figure 1 : An overview of the training and evaluation setup. Models are trained offline with potentially sub-optimal data. We adapt CQL to the multi-task setup via a multi-headed architecture. The pre-trained visual encoder is reused in fine-tuning (the weights are either frozen or fine-tuned), whereas the downstream fully-connected layers are reinitialized and trained. pre-training. Thus, it is unclear whether offline Q-learning can be scaled to high-capacity models trained on a large, diverse dataset.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that with careful design decisions, offline Q-learning can scale to highcapacity models trained on large, diverse datasets from many tasks, leading to policies that not only generalize broadly, but also learn representations that effectively transfer to new downstream tasks and exceed the performance in the training dataset. Crucially, we make three modifications motivated by prior work in deep learning and offline RL. First, we find that a modified ResNet architecture (He et al., 2016) substantially outperforms typical deep RL architectures and follows a power-law relationship between model capacity and performance, unlike common alternatives. Second, a discretized representation of the return distribution with a distributional cross-entropy loss (Bellemare et al., 2017) substantially improves performance compared to standard Q-learning, that utilizes mean squared error. Finally, feature normalization on the intermediate feature representations stabilizes training and prevents feature co-adaptation (Kumar et al., 2021a) .\nTo systematically evaluate the impact of these changes on scaling and generalization, we train a single policy to play 40 Atari games (Bellemare et al., 2013; Agarwal et al., 2020) , similarly to Lee et al.",
        "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various tasks and have been widely used in critical domains such as facial recognition (Schroff, Kalenichenko, and Philbin 2015) , medical diagnostics (Peng et al. 2021) , and autonomous driving (Tian et al. 2018) . Despite their unprecedented achievements, DNNs remain vulnerable to the well-crafted adversarial examples (Szegedy et al. 2014; Biggio et al. 2013) , and there has been a recent thrust on generating adversarial examples through, e.g., L p -norm restricted attack (Goodfellow, Shlens, and Szegedy 2015; Kurakin, Goodfellow, and Bengio 2017; Madry et al. 2018; Carlini and Wagner 2017; Moosavi-Dezfooli, Fawzi, and Frossard 2016) , and unrestricted attack (Brown et al. 2017; Hosseini and Poovendran 2018; Bhattad et al. 2020; Song et al. 2018; Qiu et al. 2020; Yuan et al. 2022) .\nThe L p -norm approaches reveal DNNs' vulnerability by searching for the perturbation in raw pixel-space within a bounded norm to preserve the photo-realism, while the unrestricted approaches replace such bounded perturbation with, e.g., geometric distortions (Guo et al. 2018) , color/texture changing (Hosseini and Poovendran 2018; Bhattad et al. 2020; Yuan et al. 2022) , and semantic changing (Qiu et al. 2020; Song et al. 2018) , etc. Nevertheless, the majority of these methods assume that an attacker can modify any features as they wish, which is unreasonable if we aim to generate an adversarial example in real-world, e.g., the intractability of accessing the digital input to an image recognition model renders those methods perturbing the raw pixel-space fail. Moreover, we argue that only altering the alterable features while leaving others unchanged might also be impractical as it ignores the effect caused by the altering features, which has been underappreciated by the majority of the existing methods.\nAs a motivating example, consider a credit scoring model used by a financial institution to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants. The model incorporates various features such as income, debt-to-income ratio, and credit history. To produce the adversarial example, it is unreasonable to disturb the income while leaving the debt-to-income ratio unchanged as it is induced by income and debt. This seemingly trivial observation has the underappreciated aspect that a causal generating process should also be involved to produce the adversarial example toward a practical scenario.\nIn this work, we provide a new perspective view on the adversarial attacks by taking the causal generating process into consideration, and propose a framework, CADE, that can generate Counterfactual ADversarial Examples. We introduce our CADE by answering two fundamental ques-tions: 1) where to attack: understanding the adversarial example from the causal perspective to select valid disturbed variables; 2) how to attack: leveraging the causal generating process to generate more realistic/reasonable adversarial examples, since naively changing the cause variable without changing the effect variables will result in unrealistic examples. First, to answer where to attack, incorporated with structural information of the data, we give theoretical characterizations of the vulnerability of discriminative DNNs, i.e., the non-robustness to the interventional data, to which human perception is robust thanks to the capability of causal inference.",
        "D EEP learning has become a powerful tool of big data mining in Earth Observation (EO) [1] . However, supervised deep learning methods are notorious data-hungry, requiring large amounts of high-quality labeled data to avoid overfitting. Despite the abundance of Remote Sensing (RS) images, obtaining accurately annotated labels poses a significant challenge due to the expensive, laborious, and time-consuming nature of the annotation process, which often involves domain experts and field surveys.\nC. Liu (chenying.liu@dlr.de) and Y. Wang (Yi.Wang@dlr.de) are with the Chair of Data Science in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich (TUM), and the Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR). C. M. Albrecht (Conrad.Albrecht@dlr.de) is with the Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR). Q. Li (qingyu.li@tum.de) and X. X. Zhu (xiaoxiang.zhu@tum.de) are with the Chair of Data Science in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich (TUM).\nNevertheless, there are many sources of labels from which we can easily obtain large amounts of labeled data with minimal efforts. For instance, Volunteered Geographic Information sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM) collect label information from individuals in a volunteer capacity and make it freely available [2] . Another approach is to design automatic labeling tools, such as AutoGeoLabel [3] , to generate labels rapidly for RS images from high-quality data sources e.g., LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. Additionally, various land use land cover products, including Google's Dynamic World [4] , ESA's World Cover [5] , and Esri's Land Cover [6] , offer rich information for EO. Nevertheless, these label sources often result in unreliable labels, e.g., noisy labels due to insufficient human annotation. For example, [7] documents human uncertainty for the classification of local climate zones. As reported in [8] , deep learning models are known for their large number of parameters and capability of learning complex functions, yet vulnerability to label noise. This also applies to segmentation tasks [9] . Therefore, these readily available labels require special considerations when applied to realworld scenarios. Beyond model training, noisy labels may significantly affect the evaluation of methodologies as well [10] .\nWhile learning from noisy labels (LNL) has been extensively studied for image classification tasks, few approaches have been developed for image segmentation tasks. Existing LNL methods for segmentation tasks mainly borrow ideas from LNL for classification and semi-supervised segmentation methods. In the former case from classification tasks, a set of regularization techniques such as consistency regularization [11] or entropy minimization [12] is used to constrain the optimization space. Nevertheless, label noise behaves differently in these two types of tasks. In classification tasks, the entire image is treated as a single sample unit and can be considered to have approximately similar levels of uncertainty. Thus, random flipping can be used to simulate label noise for classification tasks. In contrast, the sample unit in segmentation tasks is a pixel, and neighboring pixels are interconnected through spatial dependencies [13] . As a result, pixels located near boundaries are more difficult to define. From this perspective, we can classify pixel-wise label noise into two categories: assignment noise and shape noise. Assignment noise occurs when objects are labeled incorrectly, while shape noise refers to inexact object delineation caused by such phenomena as coarse annotations. In practice, inaccurate co-registration of image-mask pairs is another common source of label noise, mainly leading to shape noise with misaligned boundaries [14] . Generally, assignment noise incurs more severe damage on model training than shape noise does. This difference is illustrated in Section III-B. Moreover, LNL for natural image segmentation is usually studied in the context of weakly supervised learning, where pixel-wise noisy labels are derived with image-level annotations by GradCAM and its variants from object-centric images [15] , [16] . Thus, the primary label noise is the shape noise, while RS applications usually face more complex noise types due to different image characteristics and more diverse noisy label sources.\nAs regards the ideas borrowed from the semi-supervised learning domain, self-training methods are naturally related to the noisy label problem, where pseudo labels generated by the classifier itself inevitably incur some inaccurate assignments [17] . Following this paradigm, [18] - [20] correct possibly wrong labels in the training set by means of high-confidence or low-uncertainty predictions. To make these methods effective, the questions of when and how to correct the labels should be considered. In semi-supervised scenarios, only a small part of the accurately labeled patches is available at the beginning. The training set is gradually expanded via adding pseudo labels as training continues, during which the impact of bad pseudo labels can be offset to some extent by the advantages brought by training size expansion. LNL settings do not confer this advantage since the classifier originally has access to a large number of labels that are not as accurate as expected. Therefore, manually setting the warm-up length as in [19] can easily lead to an early or late start of correction, risking correction effectiveness degradation when model predictions are not reliable enough.",
        "In concordance with the report of Internet World Stats 2019 [1] , the access to the Internet and web technology has grown fastly and let the users interact trough different platforms. Considering the ambit related to the working market, and the high demand and offer of job places, it is possible to observe that there is a set of unstructured data which contain important information related to the profile of candidates for a particular job, some of these websites as: Computrabajo, Bumeran, Info Jobs, etc., thatusually has the profile of the positions and the Curriculum Vitae(CV) of the candidates.\nFrequently, the users have specific preferences [2] related with some products or objects, these preferences are present in non-explicit text then the information about the likes or dislikes must be extracted from the text. The preferences of one user usually are represented using a matrix, and the content of the matrix has the level of preference for one specific product. Thus, the research on Text Mining(TM) [3] uses Natural Language Processing(NLP) to extract information from the text written by human beings. The automatization is necessary for the big number of sources( emails, documents, social networks, etc.)\nRecommendation Systems(RS) are useful to suggest or recommend one item( product, object, etc.) to one user based on the information from other users.

        "T HE industrial manufactory has widely applied robots in various areas such as welding and product loading or placing. Most of them always execute the above tasks under manual teaching or programming. So automatic production urges an efficient and robust optimal motion planning (OMP) algorithm to elevate industrial intelligence.\nThough former OMP studies gain a collision-free optimal trajectory for a safe and smooth motion by numerical optimization [1] - [4] or probabilistic sampling [5] - [10] , there still exist two main concerns this paper aims to solve:\n(i) Reliability: The numerical methods, such as CHOMP [1] , GPMP [2] , and TrajOpt [3] , can rapidly converge to a minimum with descent steps informed by the deterministic momenta/gradients. However, the local minima (i.e., failure plannings) are unavoidable with an inappropriate initial point. That is because the momenta information only describes the manifold of a local space near the initial point. So it is difficult for them to plan a safe motion with a high success rate (i.e., high reliability) in a narrow space.\n(ii) Efficiency: The sampling method like STOMP [8] directly samples the trajectories to gain the optima. Others like RRT-Connect [7] grow a searching tree by the randomly sampled waypoints. Their sampling and wiring process can generate safe trajectories free of manifold information. However, their efficiency highly depends on the proportion the feasible subspace takes of the overall searching space. So the indiscriminate process takes enormous computation resources (i.e., low efficiency) in a narrow space. This paper proposes iSAGO (Figure 1 ), which integrates the Stochastic and Accelerated information of Gradients and builds a Bayes tree for an incremental Optimization:\n(i) To address reliability, Stochastic trajectory optimization with moment adaptation (STOMA, Section IV-C) overcomes the local minima from the body-obstacle stuck cases by randomly selecting variables, such as collision-check balls, time intervals, and penalty factors. The information leakage of the stochastic momenta can somewhat modify OMP's manifold with fewer local minima.\n(ii) Considering the low efficiency of STOMA with O(log N/N ) convergence rate, iSAGO integrates accelerated gradient descent (AGD, Section IV-B) in the non-stuck case because its O(1/N 3 2 ) convergence rate of gradient norm is proven optimal in the first-order convex optimization. Furthermore, iSAGO adopts Bayes tree inference to optimize the trajectory incrementally (Section IV-A) for the further efficiency elevation, which optimizes the convex or nonconvex sub-trajectories separately in iSAGO.reTrajOpt.",
        "Robotic platforms rely on dynamics models for manipulating objects, motion planning and control. Precisely, having a good dynamics model leads to executing trajectories in an accurate yet compliant manner. Traditionally, the inverse dynamics model was computed using rigid body dynamics equations. However, modern systems rely on a vast array of sensors which are noisy, leading to inaccurate models when computed analytically. Additionally, unmodelled effects and dynamics such as manufacturing uncertainties, wear and tear, and friction lead to model inaccuracies which could potentially result in undesirable behaviour. Non-parametric models address this by adopting a data-driven approach where the model can learn any non-linear function encompassing the forces present in the robot dynamics. Here, the problem is viewed as a mapping function from the input states to the output torque.\nThere exist different regression methods that have been used successfully to learn inverse dynamics models, such as Gaussian processes (GPs) [1] and neural networks (NNs) [2] . Gaussian processes offer an accurate prediction with uncertainty estimation represented through the covariance function. However, their computational complexity scales exponentially in O(n 3 ), where n is the set of training data points, and they suffer from quadratic space complexity. To mitigate this challenge, methods such as local GPR [1] , sparse GP regression (GPR) [3] , [4] and drifting GPs [5] have been introduced.\nNonetheless, these methods still scale quadratically with the samples (O(n 2 )) and are thus limited to a few thousand samples. A more scalable method is the sparse variational Gaussian process regression (SVGPR) [6] method which uses inducing points as an approximation of the full training dataset, with the addition of variational inference to give a tractable objective function.",
        "Comparative analysis of scalar fields is a core subject in the field of scientific visualization. Over the last years, comparisons performed on topological abstractions have received increased interest, as it has two major advantages over direct comparisons between scalar fields: First, abstract comparisons capture purely topological similarity, which for example reduces the impact of geometric symmetries. Second, the abstractions are typically orders of magnitude smaller than the actual domain. The latter aspect is of utmost interest in times of quickly increasing complexity of ensemble datasets. One abstraction that has received particularly high interest is the merge tree, which represents the nesting of super-or sublevel sets in a rooted tree structure.\nOne possible approach is to apply tree edit distances to merge trees. Tree edit distances are an established framework for measuring similarity of rooted trees [5, 7, 31, 41] . Typically, these metrics are intuitive, efficiently computable, and correspond to mappings between substructures. Moreover, the metric property and edit mappings makes them suitable for tasks beyond simple distance computations, such as feature tracking, interpolation, or clustering [22, 27, 36] .\nSpecifically for merge trees, there is a rapid development of specialized tree edit distances [27] [28] [29] [30] 34, 36] and their applications in various analysis tasks on scalar fields [22, 27, 28, 30] . A major hurdle for these distances are so-called vertical and horizontal instabilities (using the notation from Saikia et al. [28] ).\nVertical instabilities stem from using an abstract representation \u00a9 2023 IEEE. This is the author's version of the article that has been published in the proceedings of IEEE Visualization conference. The final version of this record is available at: xx.xxxx/TVCG.201x.xxxxxxx/ instead of the merge tree itself: the persistence-based branch decomposition, derived by the so-called elder rule [12] (we will omit details here). Here, small-scale perturbations in the data can lead to a change in the hierarchy of branches, which in turn leads to poor-quality results of distances based on this hierarchy. One of the most recent works [34] introduced the so-called deformation-based edit distance, which circumvents the use of branch decompositions. The paper provided a novel notion of edit operations on merge trees as well as an algorithm for a constrained variant of this distance: the path mapping distance. This path mapping distance is significantly less susceptible to vertical instabilities than previous methods working on persistence-based branch decompositions.",
        "Future wireless networks, such as the six-generation (6G) and beyond, need to support communications for increasingly more densely distributed wireless devices, while incurring low power consumption and ensuring super reliability. To achieve this challenging goal, the current technology trend is to equip the base station (BS) or the entire wireless network with a rapidly growing number of antennas, e.g., from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) [1] , [2] Aerial users to cell-free massive MIMO [3] , [4] , and extremely largescale MIMO [5] , [6] . However, this approach inevitably results in steadily increasing hardware cost, energy consumption, and signal processing/computational complexity, which thus cannot fulfill the high performance and efficiency expectations of future wireless networks completely. One major limitation of current MIMO communication systems lies in the fact that the antennas are deployed at fixed positions at the BS or distributed access points. As a result, given that the total number of antennas is fixed, the wireless network cannot allocate its antenna resources flexibly based on the spatially non-uniform distributions of the users, beyond the traditional adaptive MIMO processing (e.g., transmit precoding, receive combining). Thus, with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the adaptation to changes in the 3D spatial distribution of users is very limited.\nRecently, six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has been proposed as a new and effective solution for improving MIMO system capacity without the need of adding more antennas, by fully exploiting the adaptability of the 3D positions and 3D rotations of limited number of antennas at the BS [7] . As shown in Fig. 1 , a 6DMA-enabled BS generally comprises a number of 6DMA surfaces each of which can be independently adjusted in terms of both 3D position and 3D rotation, subject to practical movement constraints. Each 6DMA surface is connected to a central processing unit (CPU) at the BS via an extendable and rotatable rod, which contains flexible wires for providing power supply to the 6DMA surface and facilitating radio-frequency(RF)/control signal exchange between it and the CPU. At the two ends of the rod, two motors are installed which are controlled by the CPU to adjust the 3D position and 3D rotation of the connected 6DMA surface. By jointly designing and tuning the positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces adaptively according to the users' spatial distribution (and the corresponding longterm/statistical channel state information (CSI)), it was shown in [7] that 6DMA-BSs can significantly improve the network capacity compared to conventional BSs with FPAs, with only slow/infrequent adjustment of the positions/rotations of 6DMA surfaces. The appealing capacity gain is mainly due to the adaptive positioning/rotating of the antennas at the BS allocating them to match the spatial user distribution, which enhances not only the channel gains by fully exploiting directionality of antennas, but also the spatial multiplexing gains and interference mitigation capabilities, especially when the user distribution is spatially non-uniform.\nWe note that the 6DMA systems considered in [7] and in this paper differ significantly from the existing fluid antenna (FA) system [8] , [9] , or 2D movable antenna (2DMA) systems [10] - [12] , and has unique advantages in comparison with them. Firstly, the existing works on FA/2DMA predominantly consider the movement of antennas along a given line or on a given 2D surface with a finite length/area. As a result, a BS equipped with FA/2DMA is unable to adapt to the variations of the 3D spatial user distribution (see Fig. 1 ) due to their limited degrees of freedom (DoFs) in movability. In contrast, the proposed 6DMA-BS can more flexibly adjust the 3D positions and 3D rotations of antennas/antenna surfaces via mechanical motors, and therefore can more effectively adapt to spatially non-uniform user distribution/channel statistics. Secondly, in existing works on FA/2DMA, the individual antennas usually serve as the basic movable units to maximally exploit the instantaneous channel spatial variation, which requires frequent antenna movement and thus incurs high implementation cost and time overhead, especially for applications with fast time-varying channels. In contrast, the proposed 6DMA-BS moves the entire antenna surface as a basic unit, which reduces implementation cost and complexity. In addition, 6DMA surfaces need to be adjusted in position and rotation much less frequently as the users' spatial distribution and channel statistics are expected to vary only slowly over time.\nIn [7] , the highly optimistic assumption is made that 3D positions and 3D rotations of all 6DMA surfaces can be adjusted in a continuous manner, so as to exploit the greatest flexibility in movement and thus achieve the highest capacity gain. However, in practice, this is difficult to realize since 6DMA surfaces need to be mechanically moved by physical devices, such as a stepper motor, which can only adjust the position/rotation of each 6DMA surface in discrete steps, which are usually specified by the motor used. As such, discrete position/rotation adjustments of 6DMA surfaces will limit their spatial DoFs for adaption and thus inevitably cause capacity degradation as compared to their continuous counterparts. Hence, for achieving a network capacity gain with the 6DMA-BS, the joint optimization of the 3D positions and 3D rotations of the 6DMA surfaces becomes more crucial in the discrete case, which thus motivates the current work.",

Recently, neural topic models (Gupta et al., 2019b; a; Miao et al., 2016) have been shown to outperform LDA-based models. Thus, we consider neural network based topic models in this work.\nLanguage models (LMs) (Mikolov et al., 2010; Peters et al., 2018) have recently gained success in natural language understanding by predicting the next (target) word in a sequence given its preceding and/or following context(s), accounting for linguistic structures such as word ordering. However, LM are often contextualized by an n-gram window or a sentence, ignoring global semantics in context beyond the sentence boundary especially in modeling documents. To capture long-term semantic dependencies, recent works (Wang et al., 2018; Lau et al., 2017; Dieng et al., 2017) have attempted to introduce document-level semantics in LMs at sentence-level by marrying topic and language models, e.g., augmenting LSTM-based LMs with a latent document-topic proportion (association) obtained from a topic model for the document in which the sentence appears.\nMotivation 1: While augmenting LMs with topical semantics, existing approaches incorporate latent document-topic proportions and ignore an explanatory representation for each latent topic of the proportion. Here, the explanatory representation of a topic refers to a vector representation obtained from a set of high-probability terms in its topicword distribution.",
        "Generating natural and expressive robotic motions for humanoid robots has gained considerable interest from both robotics and computer graphics communities [1] - [5] . Recently, this phenomenon has been accelerated by the fact that more human-like robots are permeating our daily lives through applications such as interactive services or educational robots. However, in order to generate a number of natural motions for humanoid robots, a substantial amount of effort is often required to manually design time-stamped robotic motions by animators or artists.\nOne alternative approach is to leverage existing motion capture or animation data to generate robotic motions, which is often referred to as motion retargeting. Traditionally, motion retargeting is performed by manually defining a mapping between two different morphologies (e.g., a human actor and an animation character). This requires one to first design (or optimize) the pose feature of the source domain to transfer, and then find the corresponding pose in the target domain. For instance, the source and target can be human skeletons and humanoid robot joint angles, respectively. However, a substantial amount of effort is often required to manually design a proper mapping between the domains because kinematic constraints have to be taken into consideration as well.\nOn the other hand, data-driven motion retargeting has been used to circumvent the manual mapping process by leveraging machine learning methods [2] .

Another important benefit of data-driven motion retargeting is the lightweight computation requirement of the execution phase as no iterative optimization is involved during the execution. However, one clear drawback is that we have to collect a sufficient number of training data in advance. Moreover, it is not straightforward how to ensure the feasibility of the motion when using a learning-based model.",
        "Mean field theory has shown great promise in the analysis of algorithms widely used in machine learning, and computer science, including the optimization of shallow [Chizat and Bach, 2018; Chizat, 2022a] and deep neural networks [de G. Matthews et al., 2018; Pennington et al., 2018 Pennington et al., , 2017;; Xiao et al., 2018] , and average case computational complexities for NP-hard problems [Ding et al., 2015] . The mean field regime is a theoretical setting to study problems where the number of parameters (or input size) goes to infinity. Such overparameterization reveals coarse structures by integrating fine details.\nThere is a gap between the mean-field regime and the regime of finite problem size [Lewkowycz et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022; de G. Matthews et al., 2018] . Since mean-field predictions do not necessarily hold in standard settings [Bach, 2021] , a recent line of research investigates how accurate the mean-field predictions are [Li et al., 2022] .",
        "Randomized experimentation, or A/B testing, is widely used to estimate causal effects on online platforms. Basic strategies involve partitioning the experimental units (e.g., users or time periods) into two groups randomly, and assigning one group to treatment ad the other to control. A key chal-lenge in modern A/B testing is interference: From two-sided markets to social networks, interference between units complicates experimentation and makes it difficult to estimate the true effect of a treatment.\nThe spillover effect in experimentation has been extensively studied (Manski, 2013; Aronow et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021; Ugander et al., 2013; Sussman & Airoldi, 2017; Toulis & Kao, 2013; Basse & Airoldi, 2018; Cai et al., 2015; Gui et al., 2015; Eckles et al., 2017; Chin, 2019) . A majority of these works assume neighborhood interference, where the spillover effect is constrained to the direct neighborhood of an individual as given by an interference graph. Under this assumption, Ugander et al. (2013) proposed a clustering-based design, and showed that if the growth rate of neighborhoods is bounded, then the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator achieves an asymptotically optimal mean squared error (MSE) of \u00d5(d/N ), where d is the maximum degree. As there are many settings in which interference extends beyond direct neighbors, Leung (2022) considers a relaxed assumption in which the interference is not restricted to direct neighbors, but decays as a function of the spatial distance between vertices with respect to an embedding of the vertices in Euclidean space. As a special case, if each vertex only interferes with vertices within distance h, then the HT estimator has an MSE of O(h 2 /N ) under a suitable spatial clustering design.\nOrthogonal to the spillover effect, the carryover effect (or temporal interference), where past treatments may affect future outcomes, has also been extensively studied. Bojinov et al. 2023 considers a simple model in which the temporal interference is bounded by a fixed window length. Other works model temporal interference that arises from the Markovian evolution of states, which allows for interference effects that can persist across long time horizons (Glynn et al., 2020; Farias et al., 2022; Hu & Wager, 2022; Johari et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023) . A commonly used approach in practice is to deploy switchback experiments: where the exposure of the entire system (viewed as a single experimental unit) alternates randomly between treatment and control for sufficiently long contiguous blocks of time such that the temporal interference around the switching points does not dominate. Under a switchback design, Hu & Wager (2022) shows that the difference-in-mean (DIM) estimator with an appropriately chosen burn-in period achieves an MSE of \u00d5(T -2/3 ), assuming that the Markov chains are rapidly mixing. They also showed that this rate is optimal within the class of DIM estimators.",
        "Proteins are involved in almost all the life activities of organisms, and the study of their sequences, structures, characteristics, and roles is a major area of research in the life sciences in the postgenomic era (Papin et al., 2003) .A protein sequence can be thought of as a string of amino acid letters. The residues, structural domains, and families of amino acids that make up a protein resemble words, phrases, and sentences in human language. Therefore, machine learning methods developed for natural language and other sequences are well suited to the task of predicting proteins (Ofer et al., 2021) .Most sequence-based language models [e.g., * Equal contribution. Corresponding authors.\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) , ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) ] are designed to process natural language (with a bias towards English).Considering the notable parallels between protein sequences and the structure of natural language, employing natural language processing (Chowdhary and Chowdhary, 2020) (NLP) techniques to analyze protein sequences emerges as a logical approach.\nCurrently, ESM-2 (Lin et al., 2022) , developed by Facebook, is recognized as the most extensive protein sequence language model to date, featuring a sophisticated architecture with 48 layers and over 15 billion parameters. This groundbreaking model is trained on an expansive dataset comprising up to 250 million protein sequences sourced from Uniparc (Leinonen et al., 2004) , which encompasses 86 billion amino acids (Ng and Henikoff, 2006) . The dataset's vast scale mirrors the extensive text corpora used in developing large-scale neural networks for natural language processing, highlighting the model's unmatched breadth and depth. Leveraging this comprehensive base, ESM-Fold emerges as an innovative 3D protein structure prediction tool, leveraging ESM-2's insights with just a single sequence input to significantly speed up predictions. In cases where it deeply understands sequences, ESMFold achieves atomiclevel accuracy, matching or even surpassing leading models like AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al., 2021) and RoseTTAFold (Baek et al., 2021) .",
        "In anomaly detection applications 1 , it is common to encounter anomaly data examples whose symptoms correspond to different Severity Levels (SLs). Fig. 1a shows a real-world example where faults are categorized into four different SLs, from SL1 (slightest) to SL4 (most severe). The ability of accurately assessing the severity of faults/diseases is important for anomaly detection applications, yet very difficult on low-severity examples; SL1 data clusters are much closer to the normal cluster than to their corresponding SL4 clusters in Fig. 1a . A anomaly detection system needs to be very sensitive to identify the low-severity faults; at the same time, it should keep the number of false positives low, which makes the design of such decision systems a challenging task. If labeled data from different SLs are available, then regular regression or classification approaches are suitable, as already exemplified by previous research [19, 24] . However, these fine-grained labeled datasets can take much effort to prepare and we may not always have a priori access to a full spectrum of anomaly SLs. In an extreme case, as illustrated in Fig. 1b , suppose we only have access to the two ends (i.e. the normal condition SL0 and the most severe anomaly condition SL4) of the severity spectrum; incipient anomaly instances are not available to us. If we train a classification system only using the available SL0 and SL4 data, the resulting classifier may have great performance on in-distribution data (SL0 & SL4). However, it may fail badly with identifying the incipient anomaly data. For example, most SL1 faults may be mistakenly recognized as normal by any of the decision boundaries shown in Fig. 1b . More generally, classical supervised learning approaches designed for achieving maximal separation between labeled classes (e.g. margin-based classifiers, discriminative neural networks, etc), are less effective in detecting such low-severity, incipient anomaly data examples.\nIn the absence of labeled data for certain categories of fault instances, common practices are to develop generative models, such as the Gaussian mixture model [37] , Principle Component Analysis (PCA) [15, 35] , Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network [8] and autoencoder [32, 34] .\nA potential problem for these models is that they may not always generalize well-that is, a singletrained model, when applied to an unseen incipient anomaly instance at test time, can be classified as normal [7] , i.e. becoming a false negative.\nThe solution we propose in this paper is based on ensemble learning [36] , i.e., on the process of training multiple classifiers and leveraging their joint decisions to recognize incipient anomalies. In literature, a variety of ensemble methods have been proposed on the estimation of decision uncertainties [9, 20, 21] . Fig.",
        "Recently, we have witnessed the popularization of Ultra-High-Definition TeleVision (UHDTV) and the rising of UHD TV shows in broadcasting. However, despite new media contents can be filmed by the advanced UHD recorder, remaking a large quantity of existed ones is impractical, leading to the overall short supply. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) technologies provide a promising way to reconstruct High-Resolution (HR) videos from their Low-Resolution (LR) counterparts. Furthermore, while watching sport events on TV, one may playback the fleeting moments with slow motion. Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is one of the solutions that can temporally increase the frame rate of the broadcast videos.\nIn this paper, Space-Time Video Super-Resolution (STVSR), the combination of VSR [3] - [9] and VFI [10] - [21] , is mainly researched that aims at increasing spatial resolution and temporal frame rate simultaneously. The traditional approaches to STVSR [22] - [25] typically rely on strong assumptions or hand-crafted priors, and consequently are only suited to specific scenarios. The advent of deep learning has revolutionized many areas in computer vision, including, among others, image super-resolution [26] , [27] , image quality assessment [28] , image deblurring [29] , image compression [30] , and video coding [31] . In particular, it enables the development of data-driven approaches to VFI and Super-Resolution (SR) that can capitalize on the learning capability of neural networks as opposed to relying on prescribed rules. STVSR also naturally benefits from this advancement since it can be realized via a direct combination of VFI and SR. Specifically, one can first use VFI to increase the temporal frame rate, then leverage SR to enhance the spatial resolution. Moreover, the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) VFI and SR methods (e.g., the flow-based VFI methods [13] - [18] and the meta-learning-based SR methods [2] ) have the freedom to adjust the frame rate and the spatial resolution, respectively. As a consequence, the resulting two-stage scheme is able to perform unconstrained STVSR. However, as pointed out in [32] , [33] , this two-stage scheme does not take advantage of the intrinsic relationship between temporal and spatial information, which limits the highest resolution that can be potentially achieved (see Fig. 1 ). In addition, performing STVSR in a two-stage fashion tends to be highly inefficient since VFI and SR are computationally intensive by themselves and likely involve many operations that can be shared.\nTo tackle these problems, two recent works [32] , [33] have proposed a one-stage approach to STVSR by consolidating VFI and SR.",
        "The neural network accuracy for image classification has significantly improved thanks to deep convolutional neural networks. However, a very large number of images is required for such networks to train successfully. For instance, all of the ResNet [1] neural network configurations from ResNet-18 to ResNet-152 (18 and 152 layers deep correspondingly) are trained on the ImageNet dataset [2] , which contains 1,281,167 images and 1,000 classes (about 1,200 samples per class). Obviously, for many of the practically significant tasks it is impossible to collect and label a dataset that large. Thus, learning deep convolutional networks from scratch might yield poor results. Because-of that, on the smaller datasets typically an approach called transfer learning is used instead. That is, an ImageNet pretrained network of a particular architecture is taken and then further finetuned on the target (smaller) dataset [1] , [3] , [4] . However, training on few examples per class is still a challenge. This contrasts to how we, humans, learn, when even a single example given to a child might be enough. Also, it is hard to estimate the quality of a certain ImageNet pretrained network on the target dataset. Hence, we get a model selection problem: if the model A is better than the model B on ImageNet, will it be better on our small dataset? A promising approach to resolving both of these problems is to use meta-learning or its benchmark known as few-shot learning. Meta-learning trains the network on a set of different tasks, which are randomly sampled from the whole space of tasks. By learning the network in such a way, it is assumed that the network will learn features that are relevant to all of the tasks and not only to the single one, i.e., will learn more general features.\nIn this work we focus on one of the most prominent optimization-based meta-learning methods, called Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) [5] . This method has become a keystone, and as it will be shown in the literature overview section, many of the newer method base on its ideas. Training of the MAML method is split into the socalled adaptation and meta-gradient update phases.",
        "N modern power systems, voltage source converters (VSCs) are among the most common power electronic devices. Typical application scenarios of VSCs range from the renewable energy generation, such as wind farms, to high-voltage DC and flexible AC transmission systems [1] - [3] . The existing literature [3] - [8] shows that with the high penetration of power converters, the dynamic characteristics of the power system have undergone significant changes, so that new oscillatory phenomena have emerged, threatening system stability. Some of these phenomena are associated with VSC control.\nAcross industry and academia, there is a consensus that locating the sources of oscillation is an important measure to suppress oscillation [9] , [10] . Correspondingly, in [11] , numerous methods for oscillation source location (OSL) were surveyed and categorized; the most notable is the energy-based method (EBM) [12] , which tracks the system-wide energy flow to locate the oscillation sources. The advantages of the EBM include the following: (i) compared to the location methods based on damping torque analysis or mode shape estimation, the EBM is adapted to locate forced oscillations as well as poorly damped oscillations [11] ; and (ii) the EBM is convenient for voltage/current measurements in wide-area networks [12] , [13] . With the rapid development of phasor measurement units (PMU), the EBM has been successfully used for oscillation monitoring in actual power systems [14] . Thus, this study focuses on the EBM considering its prospects for industrial applications.\nIn recent years, the EBM has been developed. For example, Wu et al. [13] proposed a distributed cooperative scheme to locate a forced oscillation source by detecting a cut-set energy flow. In addition, some studies focused on the oscillations associated with wind farms. Ma et al. [15] developed an equipment-level locating method for low-frequency oscillation sources in power systems with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) integration, based on an energy correlation topology network and dynamic energy flow. Lei et al. [16] presented a forced oscillation source location and participation assessment method for DFIGs by analyzing the energy flow, and based on this analysis, the participation factor for oscillations is proposed.\nReviewing [13] , [15] , and [16] , the formulas for energy flow, which are suitable for low-frequency OSL, were derived from [12] and proven in [17] and [18] to conform with the dissipativity theory. However, according to [4] and [6] , there is a risk of sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) in multi-VSC systems; therefore, the analysis of transient energy flow (TEF)",
        "Ensuring the safe operations of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is essential for their broad acceptance and public trust. Verification and validation are crucial to the safety of AV systems at all stages of their development from simulations to on-road testing. Conventional testing methods often require the existence of known scenarios which will later be used for verifying the AVs at the system level. Identifying such scenarios in different operational design domains (ODD) (SAE, 2018) is of a great challenge due to many possible variants that can occur in reality (Beringhoff et al., 2022) .\nAn emerging approach, namely, adaptive stress testing (AST), can address this challenge using the bottom up perspective (Corso et al., 2019; Lytskjold and Mengshoel, 2023; Hjelmeland et al., 2022) . The goal of this approach is to identify potential failure scenarios and their likelihoods of occurrences. In particular, it is designed to discover the most probable system failure events, which are traditionally formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Ritchie et al., 2015; Mark et al., 2018) . In this process, Reinforcement learning (RL) is often employed in conjunction with domain knowledge to efficiently explore the vast state space and identify failure events. To this end, the search process is guided by a reward function that encourages failures such as collisions and near-misses with a high transition probability.\nIn the literature, it has recently been used to explore the failure patterns of the intelligent driving model (IDM) under test (Zhang et al., 2023) . Prior to the application in self-driving in traffic, AST has shown great successes in numerous other relating applications, including the evaluation of aircraft collision avoidance (Ritchie et al., 2015) , maritime collision avoidance (Hjelmeland et al., 2022; Lytskjold and Mengshoel, 2023) , and autonomous vehicle pedestrian collision avoidance (Mark et al., 2018; Koren et al., 2020; Corso et al., 2019; Mark and Mykel, 2019; Mark et al., 2021) .\nNevertheless, the existing AST-based studies for AV driving have several limitations. First, the scenarios used for testing are basic, which does not include complexity of real-life driving situations. For example, Mark et al. (2018) used a simple scenario, in which the intelligent ego vehicle approaching a crosswalk where a pedestrian is crossing in front of it, to test an IDM that monitors the closest traffic participant to determine a safe distance and imminent collisions without having or taking into account the actions of surrounding vehicles. Second, the traditional IDMs under test are simple and do not account for sophisticated, realistic behaviours in driving. To address this limitation, Peter and Katherine (2021) proposed an IDM with more complex actions such as changing lanes, accelerating, decelerating, and maintaining a constant speed which are incorporated into a Deep Q Network (DQN) (Fan et al., 2020) model. However, these actions were constrained within the AV moving forward along the longitudinal direction only and without considering lateral movements.\nTo fill these gaps, in this study, we propose a novel AST framework based on the development of a comprehensive IDM model to reflect a realistic and complex driving environment on a highway. The proposed framework addresses both the above-mentioned limitations. Our main contributions are summarized as follows.\n\u2022 Develop a unified intelligent driving model (uIDM) that facilitate the movement of AV in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The uIDM enables the testing of autonomous driving in a much more realistic and complex scenarios.\n\u2022 Propose a novel AST framework to stress test the AV in a complex highway environment. Our framework includes a new reward function which encourages safe driving among other vehicles in the highway while supporting the identification of potential crashed scenarios.\n\u2022 Calibrate the framework using observations from California's accident reports and then assess its performance against existing IDMs, which later highlight the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed framework.\nThe rest of our paper is organized as follows.",
        "Due to the advancement of energy-efficient, small size, and low cost embedded devices, time series data has received an unprecedented attention in several fields of research, to name a few, healthcare [1] - [3] , finance [4] , [5] , speech and activity recognition [6] - [8] , and so on [9] - [11] . The time series has an inherent temporal dependency among its attributes (data points), which allows the researchers to analyze the behavior of any process over time. Moreover, the time series has a natural property to satisfy human eagerness of visualizing the structure (or shape) of data [12] . Numerous algorithms have developed to study various aspects of the time series such as forecasting [13] , clustering [14] , and classification [15] . The forecasting algorithms attempt to predict future data points of the time series [13] . Next, the clustering algorithms aim to partition the unlabeled time series instances into suitable number of groups based on their similarities [14] . Finally, the classification algorithms attempt to predict the class label of an unlabeled time series by learning a mapping between training instances and their labels [15] , [16] .\nTime Series Classification (TSC) has been a topic of great interest since the availability of labeled dataset repositories such as UCR [17] and UCI [18] . Consequently, a large number of TSC algorithms have emerged by introducing efficient and cutting-edge strategies for distinguishing classes. Authors in [16] , [19] , [20] focused on instance based learning where the class label of a testing time series is predicted based on a similarity measure. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [21] and its variations [16] , [20] with 1-Nearest Neighbors (1-NN) have been extensively used similarity measures in the instance based TSC algorithms.\nRecently, deep learning based TSC algorithms, discussed in [22] , have also demonstrated a significant progress in time series classification. Two robust TSC algorithms are proposed in [23] and [24] , by using ResNet and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework, respectively. The authors in [25] developed a reservoir computing approach for generating a new representation of Multivariate Time Series (MTS). The approach is incorporated into recurrent neural networks to avoid computational cost of the back propagation during classification. In [26] , the authors proposed a multivariate TSC approach by combining two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), with an attention mechanism. Two recent studies [27] , [28] employed generative adversarial networks for TSC by modeling the temporal dynamics of the data.\nThe main objective of TSC algorithms is to maximize the accuracy of the classifier using complete time series. However, in time-sensitive applications such as gas leakage detection [29] , earthquake [30] , and electricity demand prediction [31] , it is desirable to maximize the earliness by classifying an incomplete time series. A classification approach that aims to classify an incomplete time series is referred as early classification [32] - [34] . Xing et al. [32] stated that the earliness can only be achieved at the cost of accuracy. They indicated that the main challenge before an early classification approach is to optimize the balance between two conflicting objectives, i.e., accuracy and earliness. One of the first known approaches for early classification of time series is proposed in [35] , and then after several researchers have put their efforts in this direction and published a large number of research articles at renowned venues. After doing an exhaustive search, we found a minor survey in [36] , which included only a handful of existing early classification approaches and did not provide any categorization.",
        "System-Level Test (SLT) has emerged as an important additional test insertion in today's semiconductor lifecycle [1] . It is run by the circuit manufacturer in the final stage of production or by the buyer of the circuit, e.g., an automotive Tier-1 supplier who will integrate the circuit into a product, as part of incoming quality control. SLT can also be used during the post-silicon characterization phase where a circuit's extrafunctional properties are measured on a population of several hundreds or thousands \"first-silicon\" circuits.\nConventional structural and functional test methods are based on established theoretical concepts, such as fault models, detection and detectability concepts, coverages. A plethora of algorithms have been invented (and tools implementing these algorithms developed) in the last decades. SLT lacks much of this fundamental understanding; in fact, even the very term \"system-level test\" is being used in rather different meanings. This paper aims at making first steps towards laying solid theoretical foundations for SLT.

        "Machine learning is experiencing a renaissance powered by transformers. Over the past five years, neural architectures for natural language processing [8, 42] , vision [10] and several other domains have largely been subsumed by transformers [60] . Many classes of image-level generative models remain holdouts to the trend, though-while transformers see widespread use in autoregressive models [3, 6, 43, 47] , they have seen less adoption in other generative modeling frameworks. For example, diffusion models have been at the forefront of recent advances in image-level generative models [9, 46] ; yet, they all adopt a convolutional U-Net architecture as the de-facto choice of backbone. The seminal work of Ho et al. [19] first introduced the U-Net backbone for diffusion models. Having initially seen success within pixel-level autoregressive models and conditional GANs [23] , the U-Net was inherited from Pixel-CNN++ [52, 58] with a few changes. The model is convolutional, comprised primarily of ResNet [15] blocks. In contrast to the standard U-Net [49] , additional spatial selfattention blocks, which are essential components in transformers, are interspersed at lower resolutions. Dhariwal and Nichol [9] ablated several architecture choices for the U-Net, such as the use of adaptive normalization layers [40] to inject conditional information and channel counts for convolutional layers. However, the high-level design of the U-Net from Ho et al. has largely remained intact.\nWith this work, we aim to demystify the significance of architectural choices in diffusion models and offer empirical baselines for future generative modeling research. We show that the U-Net inductive bias is not crucial to the performance of diffusion models, and they can be readily replaced with standard designs such as transformers. As a result, diffusion models are well-poised to benefit from the recent trend of architecture unification-e.g., by inheriting best practices and training recipes from other domains, as well as retaining favorable properties like scalability, robustness and efficiency. A standardized architecture would also open up new possibilities for cross-domain research.\nIn this paper, we focus on a new class of diffusion models based on transformers. We call them Diffusion Transformers, or DiTs for short. DiTs adhere to the best practices of Vision Transformers (ViTs) [10] , which have been shown to scale more effectively for visual recognition than traditional convolutional networks (e.g., ResNet [15] ).",
        "Interactive 3D segmentation in radiance fields has attracted a lot of attention from researchers, due to its potential applications in various domains like scene manipulation, automatic labeling, and virtual reality. Previous methods [13, 25, 46, 47] predominantly involve lifting 2D visual features into 3D space by training feature fields to imitate multi-view 2D features extracted by self-supervised visual models [4, 39] . Then the 3D feature similarities are used to measure whether two points belong to the same object. Such approaches are fast due to their simple segmentation pipeline, but as a price, the segmentation granularity may be coarse since they lack the mechanism for parsing the information embedded in the features (e.g., a segmentation decoder). In contrast, another paradigm [5] proposes to lift the 2D segmentation foundation model to 3D by projecting the multi-view fine-grained 2D segmentation results onto 3D mask grids directly. Though this approach can yield precise segmentation results, its substantial time overhead restricts interactivity due to the need for multiple executions of the foundation model and volume rendering. Specifically, for complex scenes with multiple objects requiring segmentation, this computational cost becomes unaffordable.\nThe above discussion reveals the dilemma of currently existing paradigms in achieving both efficiency and accuracy, pointing out two factors that limit the performance of existing paradigms. First, implicit radiance fields employed by previous approaches [5, 13] hinder efficient segmenta-tion: the 3D space must be traversed to retrieve a 3D object. Second, the utilization of the 2D segmentation decoder brings high segmentation quality but low efficiency.\nAccordingly, we revisit this task starting from the recent breakthrough in radiance fields: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a game changer because of its ability in high-quality and real-time rendering. It adopts a set of 3D colored Gaussians to represent the 3D scene. The mean of these Gaussians denotes their position in the 3D space thus 3DGS can be seen as a kind of point cloud, which helps bypass the extensive processing of vast, often empty, 3D spaces and provides abundant explicit 3D prior. With this point cloud-like structure, 3DGS not only realizes efficient rendering but also becomes as an ideal candidate for segmentation tasks.\nOn the basis of 3DGS, we propose to distill the finegrained segmentation ability of a 2D segmentation foundation model (i.e., the Segment Anything Model) into the 3D Gaussians. This strategy marks a departure from previous methods that focuses on lifting 2D visual features to 3D and enables fine-grained 3D segmentation. Moreover, it avoids the time-consuming multiple forwarding of the 2D segmentation model during inference. The distillation is achieved by training 3D features for Gaussians based on automatically extracted masks with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) [23] .",
        "Ancient cultural heritage stands as a record of human civilization, aiding in the understanding of human history and culture. Regrettably, many ancient artefacts have fallen prey to the ravages of time, natural deterioration, or deliberate human actions, expecting preservation and restoration. Deep learning technology has witnessed a series of remarkable advancements in the restoration of ancient cultural relics, including pottery (Farajzadeh and Hashemzadeh, 2021; Ostertag and Beurton-Aimar, 2020) , architecture (Zou et al., 2021) , murals (Wang et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2020) , etc. Among the myriad facets of cultural heritage, written language is the quintessential vessel of human thought, recording human history with symbols. Restoring ancient texts aimed at proffering suggestions for the attribution of the fragmented scripts.

It also employs a multitask learning paradigm to predict the damaged characters and generate restored images simultaneously.\nWe tested the MMRM model by experiments on both simulated data and authentic ancient inscriptions.",
        "The problem of private data release, including privacypreserving data publishing (PPDP) [30] [40] and privacypreserving data synthesis (PPDS) [5] [7] [25] [44] , has become increasingly important in recent years. We often encounter situations where a data holder wishes to outsource analytical tasks to the data scientists in a third party, and even in a different division in the same office, without revealing private, sensitive information. This outsourced data analysis raises privacy issues that the details of the private datasets, such as information about the census, health data, and financial records, are revealed to an untrusted third-party. Due to the growth of data science and smart devices, high dimensional, complex data related to an staying at LINE Corporation. individual, such as face images for authentications and daily location traces, have been collected. In each example, there are many potential usages, privacy risks, and adversaries.\nFor the PPDP, a traditional approach is to ensure k-anonymity [40] . There are lots of anonymization algorithms for various data domains [4] [16] [30] . However, k-anonymity does not take into account adversaries' background knowledge.\nFor releasing private statistical aggregates, differential privacy (DP in short) is known as the golden standard privacy notion [17] . Differential privacy seeks a rigorous privacy guarantee, without making restrictive assumptions about the adversary. Informally, this model requires that what can be learned from the released data is approximately the same, whether or not any particular individual was included in the input database. Differential privacy is used in broad domains and applications [7] [11] [36] . The importance of DP can be seen from the fact that US census announced '2020 Census results will be protected using \"differential privacy,\" the new gold standard in data privacy protection' [3] [9] .\nDifferentially private data synthesis (DPDS) builds a generative model satisfying DP to produce privacy-preserving synthetic data from the sensitive data. It has been well-studied in the literature [5] [12] [25] [42] [44] [45] . DPDS protects privacy by sharing a differentially private generative model to the third party, instead of the raw datasets (Figure 1 ).",
        "Sequence-to-sequence models (seq2seq: Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017) have become a powerful and flexible tool for a variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT), morphological inflection (MI; Faruqui et al., 2016) , and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P; Yao and Zweig, 2015) . These models often perform well, but they have a bias that favors short hypotheses. This bias is problematic: it has been pointed out as the cause (Koehn and Knowles, 2017; Yang et al., 2018; Murray and Chi-ang, 2018) of the beam search curse, in which increasing the width of beam search actually decreases performance on neural machine translation (NMT). Further illustrating the severity of the problem, Stahlberg and Byrne (2019) showed that the highest-scoring target sequence in NMT is often the empty string, a phenomenon they dubbed the cat got your tongue problem. These results are undesirable because they show that NMT models' performance depends on the search errors induced by a narrow beam. It would be preferable for models to assign higher scores to good translations than to bad ones, rather than to depend on search errors to make up for model errors.\nThe most common way to alleviate this shortcoming is by altering the decoding objective (Wu et al., 2016; He et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018; Meister et al., 2020a) , but this does not address the underlying problem: the model overestimates the probability of implausible hypotheses. Other solutions use alternate training strategies (Murray and Chiang, 2018; Shen et al., 2016) , but it would be preferable not to change the training algorithm.\nIn this paper, we propose a solution based on sparse seq2seq models (Peters et al., 2019) , which replace the output softmax (Bridle, 1990) with the entmax transformation. Entmax, unlike softmax, can learn locally sparse distributions over the target vocabulary. This allows a sparse model to shrink the search space: that is, it can learn to give inadequate hypotheses zero probability, instead of counting on beam search to prune them. This has already been demonstrated for MI, where the set of possible hypotheses is often small enough to make beam search exact (Peters et al., 2019; Peters and Martins, 2019) . We extend this analysis to MT: although exact beam search is not possible for this large vocabulary task, we show that entmax models prune many inadequate hypotheses, effectively solving the cat got your tongue problem.\nDespite this useful result, one drawback of ent-max is that it is not compatible with label smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016) , a useful regularization technique that is widely used for transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) . We solve this problem by generalizing label smoothing from the crossentropy loss to the wider class of Fenchel-Young losses (Blondel et al., 2020) , which includes the entmax loss as a particular case. We show that combining label smoothing with entmax loss improves results on both character-and word-level tasks while keeping the model sparse. We note that, although label smoothing improves calibration, it also exacerbates the cat got your tongue problem regardless of loss function.",
        "There are rich applications for model predictive controllers (MPC) that rely on timeseries forecasts as task parameters. For example, cellular network traffic schedulers predict citywide mobility data to assign base station connections to mobile devices [1] , power grid operators use electricity demand patterns to optimize battery storage [2] , [3] , and stock traders use price forecasts to make trading decisions. In these applications, the timeseries are not measured nor determined by the controllers, but by external sources. We refer to such controllers as input-driven controllers, where controllers use reliable estimates of internal control states and dynamics as well as external timeseries forecasts to make decisions, known as actions or controls. Since the controller plays a passive role in receiving external timeseries, a natural question is: are the timeseries forecasts also reliable? In this paper, we use the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to discuss how epistemic uncertainty or malicious external sources can affect control cost or constraints. We further extend the discussion to convex MPC controllers.\nRelated work: Our system model is close to [2] , which proposes an input-driven LQR controller with external forecasts of timeseries. However, in contrast to our work, it focuses on the optimal compression for timeseries across a bandwidth-limited network, while we instead focus on adversarial attacks.\nAdversarial attacks make bounded, often humanimperceptible, perturbations on a sensory input (e.g., image) to cause errors in output predictions (i.e., image classifications). [4] studies adversarial attacks Fig. 1 : Adversarial Attacks on Timeseries Forecasts For Model-Based Control. Many modern controllers require reliable forecasts of demand or prices to make decisions. In this paper, we show how slight perturbations in a forecast can dramatically increase control costs or violate control constraints. These errors in forecasting can occur due to out-of-distribution (OoD) timeseries, natural noise, or adversarial perturbations. Specifically, at time t, a controller observes state xt and timeseries \u015ct, which is perturbed by an adversarial source. Then, it takes action ut to minimize the cost J c . The next state xt+1 is determined by the real timeseries St, action ut, and previous state xt. The adversarial source perturbs timeseries St to \u015ct within a bounded perturbation in order to increase the control cost or make the controller violate constraints. on probabilistic autoregressive models, and [5] , [6] focus on adversarial noise for image classification. While [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] study adversarial attacks that affect the dynamics of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, our work exploits the structure of a model-based control task to generate adversarial attacks on timeseries inputs.\nAdversarial attacks in control systems have also been studied in [12] , [13] , [14] . They formulate the adversarial attack of a controller as a max-min problem, where the adversary's goal is to maximize the cost and the controller's goal is to minimize it.",
        "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to their exceptional accuracy in performing a broad spectrum of NLP tasks [36] . These models, trained on extensive amounts of data, exhibit increased accuracy and emergent abilities as their parameter count grows from millions to billions [52] . LLMs designed for coding are also trained on vast amounts of data and can effectively learn the structure and syntax of programming languages. As a result, they are highly adept at tasks like generating [21] , summarising [1] , and completing code [30] .\nLarge language models also exhibit emergent capabilities [50] . These abilities cannot be predicted by extrapolating scaling laws and only emerge at a certain critical model size threshold [50] . This makes it appealing to train ever-larger models, as capabilities such as chain-of-thought prompting [51] and instruction tuning [42] only become feasible in models with more than 100B parameters [50] .\nMany have noted that large language models trained on natural language are capable of memorising extensive amounts of training data [2, 5, 9, 11, 12, 15, 19, 23, 29, 32, 37, 46, 48] .\nThe issue of memorisation in source code is distinct from that of natural language. Source code is governed by different licences that reflect different values than natural language [16, 23] . Hence, in addition to privacy considerations, the memorisation of source code can have legal ramifications. The open-source code used in LLM training for code is frequently licenced under nonpermissive copy-left licences, such as GPL or the CC-BY-SA licence employed by StackOverflow [2] . 1 Reusing code covered by these licences without making the source code available under the same licence is considered a violation of copyright law. In some jurisdictions, this leaves users of tools such as CoPilot at legal risk [2, 16, 23] . Licences are unavoidably linked to the source code, as they enforce the developers' commitment to sharing, transparency, and openness [2, 16] . Sharing code without proper licences is also ethically questionable [2, 23, 46] .\nMemorised data can also include private information [10, 13, 28] . These privacy concerns extend to code, which can contain credentials, API keys, emails, and other sensitive information as well [2, 4] . Memorisation could therefore put the private information contained in the training data at risk.\nRecently, attacks which leverage memorisation have successfully extracted (or reconstructed) training data from LLMs [3, 5, 13, 29] . The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) considers data reconstruction attacks to be the most concerning type of privacy attack against machine learning models [41] . OWASP classifies Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM06) as the sixth most critical vulnerability in LLM applications. 2Larger models are more likely to memorise more data and are more vulnerable to data extraction [5, 13, 29, 41] .",
        "As social networks become integrated into people's daily routines, there is a prevalent occurrence of program-controlled bots masquerading as legitimate users for malicious purposes [Subrahmanian et al., 2016] . Social bots engage in detrimental activities such as propagating misinformation [Varol et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2023] , manipulating public opinion [Cui et al., 2020] , interfering in elections [Rossi et al., 2020] and promoting extremist ideologies [Ferrara et al., 2016] . It is therefore imperative to effectively detect social \nT T T \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\nFigure 1 : Dynamic nature of social network bots to mitigate the detrimental societal and economic impact and to preserve the integrity of social network information.\nTraditional techniques for bot detection are largely based on features, requiring extraction of either numerical feature from user information [Yang et al., 2013] or semantic features from textual information [Wei and Nguyen, 2019; Duki\u0107 et al., 2020] . However, bot operators can often bypass bot detection through advanced countermeasures, which is commonly referred to as bot evolution [Cresci, 2020] . In fact, the detectability of the feature-based methods is vulnerable to imitation and evasion, as bot operators can effortlessly steal user information from legitimate users or intersperse a few malicious messages with many neutral ones [Feng et al., 2022b] . As a result, such methods are inaccurate in spotting disguised social bots. With the advancements in graph neural networks, some researchers employed graph-based methods [Wu et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2023a] to identify the disguised social bots. They typically assume that the network structure of social bots generally differs from that of legitimate users. For instance, social bots tend to have sparser connections and randomly select users to interact with, whereas human beings prefer to connect with others who share similar characteristics [Yang et al., 2013] . These graph-based methods are among top performers by leveraging the topological structure of social networks for bot detection. However, most of the existing graph-based detection methods interpret the social network as a static graph and fail to acquire the dynamic nature of social networks. As shown in Figure 1 , there still remain two intractable issues:\nDeficiency in utilizing historical interaction graph context. Similar to the case of evading detection from featurebased methods by forging numerical or semantic features, the ever-evolving social bots are meticulously engineered to interact with legitimate users and mimic their network structures [Cresci, 2020] to escape graph-based detection. However, despite the structure of social network has changed, the discrepancies in the previous interaction graph between social bots and benign users could reveal the deception of social bots and uncover their true identity. Unfortunately, conventional approaches upon static graphs solely rely on the last state of the social network and overlook the valuable historical interaction graph context. Consequently, if the social bots have already completed their disguise, it is challenging for static graph based methods to distinguish benign users from the evolved social bots.\nLimitation of modeling evolving behavior patterns. Social bots evolve over time, evading detection by dynamically adapting their actions, strategies, or interaction patterns to mimic legitimate users. In contrast, genuine users do not require such adaptations and exhibit different evolution of behavior patterns compared to social bots. Discovering the evolving behavior patterns may enhance the effectiveness of social network modeling [Liu et al., 2020] .",
        "Disinformation is spreading widely on the internet, often propelled by political motives [1, 2] . Platforms are responding by attaching warnings to disinformation content, in order to inform users and guide their actions. Facebook implemented disinformation warnings as early as December 2016 [3] , and Google [4] , Bing [5] , and Twitter [6] have adopted similar content notices. There has been substantial public debate about the propriety of disinformation warnings, especially after Twitter began labeling tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump in May 2020 [7] . But recent studies provide scant evidence that these warnings can meaningfully influence user beliefs or behaviors, and it is an open question whether warnings are promising or futile for combating disinformation.\nSecurity researchers faced a similar challenge over a decade ago, when studies showed that warnings for malware, phishing, and other online threats broadly failed to protect users [8, 9] . After a series of iterative, multi-method studies [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , security warnings now reliably inform user security decisions and help users avoid harmful and inauthentic content [10, 17] . In this work, we adapt methods and results from the information security warning literature in order to design and evaluate effective disinformation warnings.\nA key finding from security research that we adapt to disinformation is that contextual warnings, which do not interrupt the user or compel action, are far less effective at changing behavior than interstitial warnings, which interrupt the user and require interaction [8, 9, 17] . Our work is, to our knowledge, the first to evaluate interstitial disinformation warnings.\nAnother relevant contribution from the security literature is a set of rigorous qualitative and quantitative methods for evaluating warnings, including structured models, realistic guided tasks, user interviews, and field studies (e.g., [11, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] ). Our work adapts these methods to empirically examine contextual and interstitial disinformation warnings.\nAcross two studies, we use qualitative approaches (thinkaloud exercises, interviews, and inductive coding) to understand user perceptions of disinformation warnings, as well as quantitative measures of the warnings' effects on user behavior. We consider the following research questions:\n1. After encountering contextual and interstitial disinformation warnings, how often do users change their behavior by opting for alternative sources of information? 2. Why do some users choose not to change their behaviors after encountering contextual and interstitial disinformation warnings? 3. Can interstitial warnings that are highly informative effectively change user behavior? 4. Can interstitial warnings that are highly threatening effectively change user behavior? We first conducted a laboratory experiment (n = 40) in which participants searched for specific facts on Google and encountered an interstitial or contextual disinformation warning for certain search results (Section 3). The interstitial warning was substantially more effective at changing user behavior than the contextual warning, in large part because users did not notice or comprehend the more subtle contextual warning.",
        "Modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) rely heavily on large amounts of annotated images [29] . This data-hungry nature limits their applicability to some practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, where the cost of annotating examples is prohibitive, or which involve never-before-seen concepts [9, 51] . By contrast, humans can rapidly grasp a new concept and make meaningful generalizations, even from a single example [31] . To bridge this gap, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in fewshot or low-shot learning that aims to learn novel concepts from very few labeled examples [8, 10, 34, 37, 42] .\nDespite notable successes, most of the existing work has focused on simple classification tasks with artificial settings and small-scale datasets [34, 37] . However, few-shot object detection, a task of great practical importance that learns an object detector from only a few annotated bounding box examples [18, 38, 39] , is far less explored. Few-shot detection requires determining where an object is as well as what it is (and handling distracting background regions [13] , etc.), and is much harder than few-shot classification. The most difficult regime occurs when there are very limited examples (less than 3) for novel classes (Figure 1 ), which is a common yet extremely challenging case in the real world.\nWhile few-shot classification approaches are helpful (e.g., [2, 4, 18, 33, 41] ), few-shot detection is much more than a straightforward application of few-shot classification approaches.",
        "The fundamental goal of machine learning algorithms is to identify the conditional distribution given any input and its label. In the training phase, it's conventional to assume that the underlying classifier or function belongs to a certain class of functions. Therefore presuming that the approximation error is insignificant would be a necessary practice. This practice allows the training to emphasize on what is more practical to reduce the estimation error, which is the major error a classifier develops due to incomplete data training. The estimation error can be further decomposed into optimization and generalization errors, which are greatly complementary.\nConvexity, strong convexity, smoothness, and other features of the objective function (loss function) influence the optimization error. Furthermore, the convergence rate of the optimization problem relies on the algorithm used to solve it. For example, some algorithms have a linear convergence rate, and some have a sublinear or superlinear convergence rate. The computational complexity of an algorithm is a measure of how much computer resources the algorithm utilizes to solve the optimization problem. As a result, computational complexity can be quantified in units of storage, time, dimension, or all three simultaneously.\nA common methodology to quantify the computational complexity of optimization algorithms is by counting entire gradient evaluations required to obtain an optimal solution with a given accuracy . The Gradient Descent algorithm is the most popular deterministic optimization algorithm with a linear convergence rate assuming \u00b5-strongly convex and L-smooth functions and a computational complexity of O( L \u00b5 N log 1 ) for N data objective function. On the other hand, the Stochastic Gradient Descent is the most common algorithm that randomly picks a single function every iteration and thus has different computational complexity iteration O( 1 ). When N is large, the preferred methods for solving the resulting optimization or sampling problem usually rely on stochastic estimates of the gradient of f .\nStandard variance reduction techniques used for stochastic optimizations require additional storage or the computation of full gradients. Another approach for variance reduction is through adaptively increasing the sample size used to compute gradient approximations.\nSome adaptive sampling optimization methods sizes have been studied in [Richard H Byrd and Wu, 2012 , Fatemeh S Hashemi and Pasupathy, 2016 , Daneshmand et al., 2016 , Fatemeh S Hashemi and Pasupathy, 2014 , Mokhtari and Ribeiro, 2017] . These methods have optimal complexity properties, making them useful for various applications.",
        "Transfer learning. It is a popular paradigm in machine learning, with a simple idea: leveraging knowledge from a well-studied learning problem (a.k.a. the source task) to enhance the performance of a new learning problem with similar features (i.e., the target task). In deep learning applications with limited and relevant data, transfer learning is a standard practice of utilizing large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and their corresponding pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet50). It has enjoyed success across various fields, including natural language processing (Ruder et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019) , sentiment analysis (Liu et al., 2019) , computer vision (Ganin et al., 2016; Wang and Deng, 2018) , activity recognition (Cook et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018) , medical data analysis (Wang et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022) , bio-informatics (Hwang and Kuang, 2010) , recommendation system (Pan et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2019) , and fraud detection (Lebichot et al., 2020) . See also various review papers such as (Pan and Yang, 2010; Tan et al., 2018; Zhuang et al., 2020) and the references therein. In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, where new machine learning techniques and tools emerge at a rapid pace, transfer learning is well suited as a versatile and enduring paradigm. Meanwhile, the empirical successes of transfer learning has also encouraged theoretical studies of transfer learning, particularly in terms of quantifiable way of measuring whether transfer learning is suitable under given contexts; see for instance (Mousavi Kalan et al., 2020) , (Nguyen et al., 2020) , (You et al., 2021) , (Huang et al., 2022) , (Nguyen et al., 2022) , (Tripuraneni et al., 2020) , (Galanti et al., 2022) and (Cao et al., 2023) .\nTransfer learning in finance. Transfer learning has recently gained its popularity in the field of finance, where limited data availability and excessive noise have hindered practitioners from accomplishing tasks such as equity fund recommendation (Zhang et al., 2018) and stock price prediction (Wu et al., 2022; Nguyen and Yoon, 2019) . Instead of starting from scratch for each specific task, it allows financial practitioners to capitalize on the knowledge and patterns accumulated from analogous tasks or domains, resulting in more accurate predictions and enhanced decisionmaking capabilities.\nFor instance, Zhang et al. (2018) addressed the issue of \"what to buy\" in equity fund investment by providing personalized recommendations; due the lack of transaction data in equity fund market, they utilized transfer learning and applied the profile of investors on the stock market to build that of the fund market; subsequently, this profile constituted an important role in the construction of the utility-based recommendation algorithm. Leal et al.",
        "A general paradigm in Artificial Intelligence is that one can solve provably worst case intractable search problems using heuristics that are effective in the average case, i.e., in most real world problems. This same principle holds true in robotics, where much of the difficulty stems from the geometry and the implicit nature of the search space, called the configuration space (c-space). The family of sampling based motion planning (SBMP) algorithms searches the continuous c-space using random sampling and local extensions in order to find collision free paths.\nMost such algorithms implicitly perform guided search. Early algorithms, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) [23] , showed that exploration through Voronoi bias, i.e., choosing which node to expand with probability proportional to the volume of its Voronoi cell, is highly effective in the absence of arbitrarily narrow passages. As such, much subsequent work has centered around the narrow passage problem [3] , [28] . Due to the intractable nature of motion planning, tangible improvements often came from making assumptions about the underlying space, such that the human engineer could encode case specific heuristics into the search. Some work, rather than improve runtime, focused attention on the types of solutions output by the algorithm, for example searching for paths with high clearance [16] .\nIn this work we make this previously implicit notion of guidance explicit by formally defining the concepts of guiding space and guided search. We define a guiding space as an auxiliary space that helps estimate the value of exploring each configuration. This value helps our proposed general guided search algorithm determine its next exploration step. Our definition of guidance is naturally hierarchical, as any search space (e.g., c-space) can itself be used as a guiding space. Intuitively, guidance is the bias introduced into the exploration process. Our algorithm is similar to A*, which performs heuristic guided search in discrete spaces, but does so in c-space.\nIn formally discussing guiding spaces we make the source of guidance explicit. Doing so allows us to identify guidance-generating components in many seemingly distinct prior methods, which fit under three main subcategories; robot modification, environment modification, and experience based guidance.",
        "After 2020, the fifth generation of mobile communications (5G) is expected to achieve global commercialization. From the second-generation mobile communication (2G) to 5G, the communication frequency band has been increased from 100 MHz to GHz [1] [2] . Higher frequency electromagnetic waves are exploited for more spectrum resources. In order to discover new spectrum resources, research on millimeter waves, terahertz, and optical communications will become important directions [3] [4] [5] . For optical wireless communication, free space optical communication (FSO), visible light communication(VLC), short-range near-infrared communication and other technologies have been thoroughly studied and widely applied. However, light waves are easily absorbed by non-transparent obstacles, thus optical communication scenes are usually limited to unobstructed scenarios, i.e. line-of-sight circumstances. In addition, with the increase of communication frequency bands, high-frequency signals such as millimeter waves, terahertz, etc., gradually show similar characteristics to optical signals, such as narrow pulses and easy to be blocked [6] [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, a solution is required to reduce the impact of these characteristics on communication quality.\nReconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a new type of meta-surface that can programmably modulate the electromagnetic waves passing through it [10] [11] [12] [13] . At present, the RIS structure in the microwave band is mainly composed of an array of digital coding units. The beam incident on each unit can be adjusted to control the intensity, phase, frequency, and polarity of the outgoing beam. In [12] , Boya Di, Hongliang Zhang, etc. proposed to use RIS to implement microwave beamforming, which is equivalent to adjusting the large-scale antenna array of the base station towards multiple nodes in free space. The advantage is to reduce the pressure of the base station and improve the energy utilization efficiency, and the microwave signals that have not been received can be recollected and transmitted.\nAnalogous to the RIS structure in the microwave band, the optical RIS structure needs to achieve the following functions: (1) Reflecting the incident beam; (2) Keeping the information carried by the original beam unchanged or slightly changed; (3) Controlling the intensity, phase, frequency, polarization and other characteristics of the outgoing beam programmably;\n(4) Adjusting the direction of the outgoing beam precisely to follow the user.\nIn the prior technology, spatial light modulator (SLM) and optical micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) meet the requirements [14] [15] [16] [17] . In 1982, a two-dimensional magneto-optic spatial light modulator was proposed [16] , which was used to adjust the amplitude, phase, polarization and other parameters of the light passing through it. With the lens group, SLM can reconstruct the light field with low power loss. The SLM is composed of a digital coding unit array, where each unit can programmatically adjust the amplitude and phase of the incident light, and the modulation frequency can reach 100Hz. In [18] , SLM is used for signal modulation in low-speed VLC system. In [19] , SLM is used to convert a single beam at the transmitting end into multiple beams, and generate optical signals that follow multiple mobile users. Optical MEMS is a lens array composed of freely adjustable micro lenses, which can freely adjust the direction of reflected light at each unit.",
        "Over the past decade, machine learning algorithms based on (deep) neural architectures have lead to a revolution in applications such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP). An important factor contributing to this success is the abundance of data. For most of these applications, however, the training data comes from individuals, often containing personal and sensitive information about them. For example, natural language models for applications such as suggested replies for e-mails and dialog systems rely on the training of neural networks on email data of users Chen et al. [2019] , Deb et al. [2019] , who may be left vulnerable if personal information is revealed. This could happen, for example, when a model generates a sentence or predicts a word that can potentially reveal private information of users in the training set. Many studies have shown successful membership inference attacks on deep learning models Shokri et al. [2017] , Carlini et al. [2019] . Indeed, in a recent work, Carlini et al. [2019] show that \"unintended memorization\" in neural networks is both commonplace and hard to prevent. Such memorization is not due to overtraining Tetko et al. [1995] , Carlini et al. [2019] , and ad hoc techniques such as early-stopping, dropout etc., do not prevent the risk of privacy violations. Moreover, Feldman [2020] shows that memorization is in fact necessary, provably, for some learning tasks. Thus, to prevent unintended privacy breaches one needs a principled approach for private training of deep learning models. In this paper we study training neural networks with differential privacy, a mathematically rigorous notion of privacy introduced in the seminal work of Dwork et al. [2006] , and focus on user level privacy.\nDefinition 1.1 ((\u03b5, \u03b4)-DP). We say that an algorithm M is (\u03b5, \u03b4)-DP if for any two neighboring databases D, D and any subset S of outputs, we have Pr[M (D) \u2208 S] \u2264 e \u03b5 Pr[M (D ) \u2208 S] + \u03b4.\nBesides being a provable privacy notion, it has been shown that deep learning models trained with DP protect against leakage of sensitive information; we refer the readers to Carlini et al. [2019] , Abadi et al. [2016] for more details.\nIn a highly influential paper, Abadi et al. [2016] introduced a differentially private version of stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) for training deep learning models, and showed that it is possible to achieve reasonable accuracy-vs-privacy tradeoff on common benchmarks such as MNIST and CIFAR10. Since then, there has been a vast body of work building on and extending the algorithm of Abadi et al. [2016] ; we refer the readers to McMahan et al. [2018] , Bu et al. [2019] , Carlini et al.

        "Behavior Cloning (BC) [1] is widely used in robotics as an imitation learning (IL) method [2] , [3] to leverage human demonstrations for learning control policies. Learning from humans is particularly desirable from the perspective of safe interactive robot control, as learned policies are based on the demonstrator's behavior, and requires few samples for training [3] . A common issue affecting learning via behavior cloning is limited variation in demonstration data, resulting in overly-specific, poorly generalized policies that are not robust to deviations in behavior. Specifically, learned policies may be influenced by error compounding (also known as covariate shift [4] ), where there arises a mismatch between the distributions of data used for training and testing. To robustify learning, stochastic perturbations, known as disturbance injections, are added to the demonstrator's actions, augmenting the learning space and resulting in stable policies [5] . However, a key limitation that restricts real-world control, is the assumption that demonstrators are proficient in the task and can provide consistently highquality demonstrations. Specifically, a key assumption is that error compounding can be solved by assuming demonstration data is homogeneous, and can be used to learn an optimal policy simply by learning flexible generalizations of the demonstration data. In real-world scenarios, data is often heterogeneous and of varying quality, due to the difficulty 1 : Reaching task by imitation learning. (a) A demonstrator gives optimal and sub-optimal demonstrations (black arrows). Learned policy causes compounding errors (green arrows). (b) Augmentation of action distribution (gray shaded) mitigates the error. However, the optimality of demonstrations is not considered, leading to sub-optimal policy learning. (c) Combining task achievement weighting with robustification enables robust, optimal policy learning.\nof the task or human inexperience [6] - [8] . In addition, demonstrators may perform idiosyncratic behavior, which might not be task optimal (e.g., unintentional drifting [9] ), resulting in diverse-quality demonstrations. In this scenario, na\u00efve application of disturbance injections does not consider the demonstration quality, and this diverse-quality bias policy learning, leading to over-generalized policies.",
        "The global air transportation system has grown to become an integral and indispensable part of the global economy.\nWith the projected growth in scale over the coming decades, the aviation industry is expected to better facilitate the movement of people and cargo around the globe in more diversified forms. In the meantime, however, the environmental impact of aviation, also referred to by some as the most significant adverse impact of aviation [1] , has materialized as an enormous international concern. The three primary facets of negative aviation environmental impacts are: (1) local air quality impacts, (2) climate change impacts, and (3) community noise impacts [2] . If not properly addressed, these environmental impacts can exacerbate health-harming air pollution, accelerate global warming, and undermine affected issues. Dimensionality reduction is a potential remedy for the issues yet only applies to a fraction of the aforementioned data-driven analyses. Another solution is metric learning, which learns a tailored 'weighted' distance metric for a particular task. This subfield of machine learning can potentially be beneficial to all tasks where the notion of distance metric between objects plays a crucial role [24] . Metric learning has found applications in fields like computer vision and bioinformatics, yet has not raised enough attention to researchers in aviation and transportation. In this work, we introduce metric learning into aircraft segmentation to make the process better reflect the actual environmental impact of aircraft. The result shows that the learned distance metrics can achieve better performance than the baselines and have good generalization properties. Overall, the three contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n1) We develop a metric learning solution to conduct aircraft segmentation for environmental impact. The proposed approach consists of representative aircraft selection, computer experiment, identification of constraints, metric learning, and evaluation methods (visual and quantitative). This work also contributes as a benchmark study of metric learning in the aviation and transportation domain.\n2) We propose a novel statistical method to identify the sets of similar and dissimilar object pairs, which are used as constraints in traditional weakly-supervised metric learning algorithms. The method can help weakly-supervised metric learning algorithms learn an effective distance metric with only a small amount of information.\n3) We demonstrate the utility of the metric learning solution through a comprehensive case study. The study involves a wide range of aircraft types, aircraft features, and representative environmental impact outputs. In the analysis of the result, we report findings and discussions from various angles.",
        "Recently, large language models (LLMs)-large deep learning models that are based on the transformer architecture [1] and pre-trained on massive datasets-were proposed [2, 3, 4, 5] . For example, the researchers from OpenAI were the first to present a commercial LLM namely GPT-3.5, a large generative model pre-trained on natural language and source code. Similarly, Rozi\u00e8re et al. [2] from Meta introduced Code LLaMa, the open-source LLM that is based on LLaMa-2 model [3] further trained with source code.\nPrior studies conducted experiments focusing on different approaches to leverage LLMs (e.g., prompt engineering [6, 7, 8] , few-shot learning [9, 10, 11] and model fine-tuning [12, 13, 14] ) for downstream tasks. For instance, Arora et al. [7] proposed the prompt design based on the question-answering prompts, which helps an open-source LLM to outperform GPT-3 that few-shot learning is performed. Another example is Brown et al. [9] that conducted an empirical study of few-shot learning on LLMs for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Lastly, Chen et al. [14] conducted an experimental study of an LLM (i.e., GPT-3) fine-tuned on source code.\nBy seeing the promising capabilities of LLMs in NLP tasks, LLMs-based approaches for software engineering tasks [15, 16, 17, 18] were proposed. For example, Deligiannis et al. [15] proposed ChatGPT-based approach for fixing compilation errors in Rust. Prior work [19, 20, 21] also conducted empirical studies of LLMs on different software engineering tasks. For instance, Sch\u00e4fer et al. [21] investigated the performance of GPT-3.5 for automated unit test generation in Javascript. However, the existing literature still lacks the study of different approaches to leveraging GPT-3.5 (e.g., prompt engineering [6, 7, 8] , fewshot learning [9, 10, 11] and model fine-tuning [12, 13, 14] ) for code review automation (i.e., automatically generating improved code from submitted code) [22, 23, 24] . Thus, little is known about how GPT-3.5 should be leveraged for the code Open Science. To facilitate future work, we make the script, the dataset, and the output generated by GPT-3.5 available online 1 . Our supplementary material will be made available upon acceptance.\nPaper Organization. Section 2 describes the background with respect to the literature. Section 3 describes the study design of our study.",
        "Speech separation, also known as cocktail party problem, aims to separate target speech from interference background [1] . It is often used as the front end of speech recognition for improving the accuracy of human-machine interaction. Conventional speech separation technologies include computational auditory scene analysis [2] , non-negative matrix factorization [3, 4] , HMM-GMM [5, 6] , and minimum mean square error [7] . Recently, deep learning based speech separation becomes a new trend [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] , which is the focus of this paper. According to whether speakers' information is known as a prior, deep-learning-based speech separation techniques can be divided into three categories, which are speaker-dependent [14] , targetdependent, and speaker-independent speech separation. Speaker-dependent speech separation needs to known the prior information of all speakers, which limits its practical applications. Nowadays, the research on speech separation is mostly speaker-independent and target-dependent.\nSpeaker-independent speech separation based on deep learning faces the speaker permutation ambiguity problem. In order to solve this problem, two techniques have been proposed. The first one is deep clustering [15, 16, 17] . It projects each time-frequency unit to a higher-dimensional embedding vector by a deep network, and conducts clustering on the embedding vectors for speech separation. The second technique is permutation invariant training [18, 19, 20] . For each training mixture, it picks the permutation of the speakers that has the minimum training error among all possible permutations to train the network.\nTarget-dependent speech separation based on deep learning aims to extract target speech from a mixture given some prior knowledge on the target speaker. The earliest speech separation method takes the target speaker as the training target [21] . It has to train a model for each target speaker, which limits its practical use.",
        "Estimating and interpolating an acoustic field from discrete measurements of microphones are fundamental problems in acoustic signal processing. Such estimations can be applied to the visualization of acoustic fields [1] , interpolation of room impulse responses [2, 3] , identification of sound sources [4, 5] , capturing sound fields for spatial audio [6] [7] [8] , and spatial active noise control [9, 10] , among others. We focus on the sound field estimation problem in a source-free region.\nA typical strategy of sound field estimation is to decompose the measurements into spatial Fourier basis functions [11] , such as plane waves [7] and spherical harmonics [12, 13] . However, the empirical setting of the truncation order and expansion center for the basis expansion is necessary. Sparsity-based approaches using the same basis functions have also been widely investigated [14, 15] to increase the spatial resolution. The main drawback of this method is that the inference operator of expansion coefficients becomes nonlinear. Thus, the estimation is basically performed by iterative processing.\nThe infinite-dimensional analysis of a sound field is proposed in [16] , which corresponds to the kernel ridge regression when estimating a pressure field with pressure microphones [17] . This method does not require the empirical setting of truncation order and expansion center. Furthermore, the estimation is performed by a linear operation. In [18, 19] , the kernel function using prior information on source directions is proposed. The estimation accuracy can be higher than that of the method without prior source direction [17, 20] by using the directionally weighted kernel.\nThe kernel function with directional weighting includes two parameters to be set, which are derived from the parameters of the von Mises-Fisher distribution [21] . One is the prior source directions and the other represents the spread of the weighting. In [18, 19] , these parameters were empirically determined; however, source directions are not necessarily available in practical situations. Moreover, the optimal setting of the spread parameter is not a trivial task.\nWe propose a method to optimize the parameters of the directional kernel function from microphone measurements. We simplify the problem by discretizing the parameters and representing the kernel function as a weighted sum of sub-kernels.",
        "In Federated Learning (FL) [35] , a set of clients jointly solve a machine learning problem under the coordination of a central server. To protect privacy, clients keep their own data locally and share model parameters periodically with each other. Several challenges of FL are widely studied in the literature, such as user privacy [35, 39, 53] , communication cost [17, 21, 31, 50, 55] , data heterogeneity [5, 13, 20, 29, 54] etc.. However, a key challenge is ignored in the literature: the label quality of user data. Data samples are manually annotated, and it is likely that the labels are incorrect. However, existing algorithms of FL e.g. FedAvg [35] treat every sample equally; as a result, the learned models overfit the label noise, leading to bad generalization performance. It is challenging to develop an algorithm that is robust to the noise from the labels. Due to privacy concerns, user data are kept locally, so the server cannot verify the quality of the label of the user data. Recently, several intuitive approaches [8, 52, 59] based on the use of a clean validation set have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we take a step forward and formally formulate the noisy label problem as a bilevel optimization problem; furthermore, we provide two efficient algorithms that have guaranteed convergence to solve the optimization problem.\nThe basic idea of our approach is to identify noisy label samples based on its contribution to training. More specifically, we measure the contribution through the Shapley value [46] of each sample. Suppose that we have the training dataset D and a sample \ud835\udc60 \u2208 D. Then for any subset S \u2282 D/{\ud835\udc60}, we first train a model with S only and measure the generalization performance of the learned model, then train over \ud835\udc46 \u222a {\ud835\udc60} and calculate the generalization performance again.",
        "Over the past several decades, the emergence of big data and machine learning workloads has given rise to massive data-driven applications. These applications, which include large language models [1] , intrusion detection systems [2] , and graph processing frameworks [3] , [4] , consume and generate data at unprecedented rates, requiring data storage in the order of terabytes (TB) and memory bandwidths in the order of TB/s. Conventional electronic memory technologies such as dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) are struggling to keep up with such demands for increasingly higher bandwidth [6] and energy efficiency [7] . Additionally, DRAM technology also faces challenges associated with scaling towards the 10-nm technology node. Current DRAM nodes, such as Micron's 1\u03b1 and 1\u03b2, are fabricated at 12-14 nm. At lower node scales, it has been shown that the DRAM cell's charge retention diminishes, cell structural integrity deteriorates, and delay and power penalties associated with bit lines increase dramatically [6] . While 3D-stacking technologies and through silicon vias have enabled high bandwidth memory (HBM), the increasing demand for capacity, throughput, and energy efficiency warrants the exploration of new main memory technologies.\nNon-volatile memories (NVMs) address the data retention challenges in DRAMs and can help avoid the need for refreshes and associated latency concerns. But NVM candidates based on ferroelectric (FRAM) [8] and resistive metal oxide (RRAM) [9] technologies generally suffer from reliability and write endurance issues. To achieve higher reliability while retaining the advantages that NVMs offer, NVMs based on phase change materials (PCMs) can be considered [10] - [12] . PCM cells show higher energy efficiency, bit densities, and bandwidth than other NVM cell types [13] , [14] . PCMs can transition between two material states: amorphous and crystalline. These states offer high resistance contrast between them and hence can be used to store data as resistance levels. In electrically controlled PCM (EPCM) cells, the phase transitions are brought about by using current pulses.",
        "The proliferation of self-driving cars by an increasing number of companies and the ability of robots to efficiently deliver food and supplies are clear manifestations of the vast improvements in autonomous navigation. Nonetheless, various unresolved challenges persist across diverse domains.\nClassical planners use analytic optimization techniques and reactive rules for collision avoidance and for finding safe paths [1] - [3] . These methods can be successful in specific domains, require no or little data, are well understood and can lead to safe and interpretable behavior. However, they often exhibit unnatural and inefficient behaviors and poor social norm compliance [4] .\nMachine learning methodologies build on the latest advancements in imitation learning (e.g., [5] , [6] ) and deep reinforcement learning (e.g., [7] - [11] ) through which they can capture the intricacy of human actions and provide enhanced environmental awareness and human-aware behavior. However, they require large and realistic datasets, and often lack safety guarantees [12] . Furthermore, because they are often based on end-to-end learning, they lack interpretability and transparency [13] . For these reasons, they can fail badly in unexpected ways on particular inputs [14] , [15] , making it difficult to rely on them.\nThis work seeks to alleviate the shortcomings of classical and learning-based methods by combining suitable components of each, building on and modifying various existing methodologies, reviewed in the next section. In particular, we exploit classical algorithms to improve the sample efficiency *This work was supported by ISF Grant 1651/19, the Helmsley Charitable Trust through the ABC Robotics Center of Ben-Gurion University, and the Lynn and William Frankel Center for Computer Science. 1 Elias Goldsztejn and 2 Ronen Brafman are with the Department of Computer Science at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. eliasgol@post.bgu.ac.il, brafman@bgu.ac.il Fig. 1 : A robot navigating autonomously using a system that integrates an RL-based policy, regularized with a classical planner, alongside a safety switching mechanism. of a learning algorithm and the performance and safety of its resulting navigation policy.\nOur main contribution is a sample-efficient learning strategy for improving classical planners and a fallback system with a trained supervisor that guarantees safety. More specifically, we suggest the following approach:\n1) Train a planner using DRL with policy guidance derived from a classical planner: We seed the replay buffer with experiences generated by the classical planner and regularize the actor in an actor-critic algorithm using the classical planner's policy. 2) Use a classical rule-based navigation policy as a fallback system and train a supervisor that performs minimal switching between the neural and classical planner to ensure safety.",
        "When asked what musical instrument they play, there are not many computer music practitioners who would respond spontaneously with \"I play the computer.\" Why not? In this report we examine the problems associated with the notion of the computer as musical instrument and the prospects for their solution.\nHere at the onset it would be useful to consider some of the special features that computer technology brings to musical instrumentation. Most traditional acoustic instruments such as strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion place the performer in direct contract with the physical sound production mechanism.\nStrings are plucked or bowed, tubes are blown, and surfaces are struck. Here the performer's gesture plays a direct role in exciting the acoustic mechanism. With the piano and organ the connection between gesture and sound is mediated by a mechanical linkage and in some modern organs by an electrical connection. But the relation between the gesture and the acoustic event remains pretty much in what one might call a one gesture to one acoustic event paradigm. When sensors are used to capture gestures and a computing element is used to generate the sound, a staggering range of possibilities become available. Sadly but understandably, the electronic music instrument industry with its insistence on standard keyboard controllers maintains the traditional paradigm. Musical instruments and their gestural interfaces make their way into common use or not for a variety of reasons most of which are social in character. These more sociological aspects like the development or not of a repertoire for the instrument are beyond the scope of this paper. Here we will concentrate on factors such as ease of use, potential for development of skill, reactive behavior, and coherence of the cognitive model for control.\nIn the figure below we provide a conceptual framework for our controller research and development. Our human performer has intentions to produce a certain musical result. These intentions are communicated to the body's sensorimotor system (\"motor program\"). Parameters are sensed from the body at the gestural interface.",
        "Studies on online social networks have played an important role in understanding social characteristics, such as human connections and behaviors, on a worldwide scale. A number of studies, e.g., [1] - [5] , have investigated the structural properties of social graphs, wherein nodes represent users and edges represent friendships between users in online social networks. In general, researchers sample the graph data for analysis because all the graph data are not available to thirdparty researchers. Crawling methods in which one repeatedly traverses a neighbor (e.g., breadth-first search and random walk) are effective for sampling graph data in online social networks where the neighbors' data of a user is available by querying the user [1] - [3] , [6] - [9] .\nGjoka et al. proposed a framework called re-weighted random walk to obtain unbiased estimates of the structural properties of social graphs via a random walk [7] , [9] . This framework addresses the sampling bias toward high-degree nodes typically induced by crawling methods. First, one performs a random walk on the graph (i.e., one repeatedly moves to a neighbor chosen uniformly and randomly) to obtain a sequence of sampled nodes. Then, one re-weights each sampled node to correct the sampling bias derived from the Markov property of the sequence. The number of available queries within a practical sampling period is typically limited [10] - [12] . Therefore, a number of algorithms that estimate structural properties using a small number of queries based on this framework have been developed [10] , [11] , [13] - [20] .\nHowever, re-weighted random walk enables analysts only to estimate local structural properties in principle. First, this framework forces analysts to sample most graph data to correct the sampling bias when attempting to estimate global structural properties, such as the shortest-path properties. Second, the quantity of re-weighted sample means is not sufficient to predict the structure of the original graph, such as its visual representation. On the other hand, analysts' interests in the characteristics of social networks are generally diverse [21] ; these characteristics include local structural properties (e.g., the degree distribution and clustering coefficient), global structural properties (e.g., the distributions of shortest-path lengths and betweenness centrality), and visual graph representations.\nTo address this gap, we study the social graph restoration problem: Given a small sample of a social graph obtained by crawling, we aim to generate a graph whose structural properties are as close as possible to the corresponding properties of the original graph. The generated graph enables us to estimate local and global structural properties and predict the visual representation of the original graph. Existing methods to address this problem include subgraph sampling [1] - [3] , [6] , [8] , [22] - [24] and Gjoka et al.'s method [15] . In subgraph sampling, one constructs the subgraph induced from a set of edges obtained using a crawling method and implicitly assumes that the subgraph is a representative sample of the original graph. In contrast, Gjoka et al.'s method generates a graph that preserves estimates of local structural properties obtained by re-weighted random walk, intending to reproduce the structural properties of the original graph, including those that are not intended to be preserved.",
        "We, at one glance, can perceive three glasses on a table; Funes, all the leaves and tendrils and fruit that make up a grape vine. He knew by heart the focus of the southern clouds at dawn on the 30th of April, 1882, and could compare them in his memory with the mottled streaks on a book in Spanish binding he had only seen once and with the outlines of the foam raised by an oar in the Rio Negro the night before the Quebracho uprising. These memories were not simple ones; each visual image was linked to muscular sensations, thermal sensations, etc. He could reconstruct all his dreams, all his half-dreams. Two or three times he had reconstructed a whole day; he never hesitated, but each reconstruction had required a whole day. He told me: \"I alone have more memories than all mankind has probably had since the world has been the world.\" And again: \"My dreams are like you people's waking hours.\" And again, toward dawn: \"My memory, sir, is like a garbage heap.\" A circle drawn on a blackboard, a right triangle, a lozenge-all these are forms we can fully and intuitively grasp; Ireneo could do the same with the stormy mane of a pony, with a herd of cattle on a hill, with the changing fire and its innumerable ashes, with the many faces of a dead man throughout a long wake. I don't know how many stars he could see in the sky.\n-Funes the Memorious, Jorge Luis Borges\nBorges' famous short story, Funes the Memorious, describes a fictional character, Ireneo Funes, who has an extraordinary capacity to remember things and events (Borges, 1962) . Funes' exceptional feats of memory, as recounted by Borges, inspire a sense of awe and fascination in us partly because they make us viscerally aware of the inferiority of our own capacity to remember in comparison.\nThe memory capacity of an average human being is, of course, nowhere near as impressive as that of Funes, yet experiments repeatedly suggest that it may still be surprisingly large and that we may often be subjectively underestimating our own capacity to remember things (Shepard, 1967; Standing, 1973; Hollingworth, 2004) . For example, in a classic study, Lionel Standing showed that humans could recognize with high accuracy 10000 pictures they were shown only once a few days prior to a recognition test (Standing, 1973) . In a more recent follow-up study, Brady et al. (2008) showed that these long-term visual memories may be remarkably detailed, fine-grained memories.\nHow would our current machine learning models fare in their ability to incorporate and retain new visual information in a head-to-head comparison with humans? Would they already perform at super-human levels, a bit like real-world artificial versions of Ireneo Funes, or would they fall significantly short of the efficiency of human memory to incorporate new visual information? In current deep learning practice, the primary mode of incorporating new information into a model is through gradient descent in the model's parameter space (other less standard ways of incorporating information into a deep learning model are discussed in the Discussion section below). In this paper, we ask if deep learning via gradient descent can match the efficiency of human long-term memory to incorporate new visual information in a rigorous, head-to-head, quantitative comparison.\nAn answer to this question would be highly informative for a few reasons: (1) if current deep learning models turn out to be inferior to humans, we can aim for human-level memory efficiency as a feasible performance target for our models (similar to aiming for human-level Go playing, humanlevel machine translation, or human-level speech recognition);",
        "Dialogue systems need to faithfully produce utterances that realize multiple types of dialogue acts (DAs), such as providing opinions, making recommendations, or requesting information. In the past, natural language generators (NLGs) for dialogue have been trained on large parallel corpora that map from a domain-specific meaning representation (MR) that specifies the desired DA and semantic attributes to an output utterance. The NLG must faithfully generate utterances that realize the style and form of the DA, and all of the specified attributes, as shown by the reference utterances in Table 1 . Recent work shows that pretrained language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for controllable NLG using prompt-based learning (PBL) (Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021) . Here we present a novel few-shot overgenerate-and-rank approach that achieves the controlled generation of DAs. Table 1 : Sample ViGGO dialogue acts (DAs) (Juraska et al., 2019) . The same attributes and values can be realized as different DAs.\nPrevious work on semantically-controlled NLG has focused on improving semantic accuracy (Rastogi et al.; Xu et al., 2021; Du et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2015; Kedzie and McKeown, 2020; Juraska and Walker, 2021) . However, Table 1 shows how the the same set of semantic attributes can be realized by different DAs, such as give_opinion, recommend and inform, each of which affect the dialogue state differently (Traum and Allen, 1994) .\nObviously an NLG for dialogue needs to faithfully realize the DA as well as the semantic attributes. However, previous work has neither controlled for nor evaluated DA accuracy. We speculate that this is because many NLG training sets, such as E2E, Weather, WebNLG, WikiBio, DART and ToTTo, only include inform DAs (Novikova arXiv:2307.14440v1 [cs.CL] 26 Jul 2023 Jul et al., 2017b;; Belz, 2008; Gardent et al., 2017; Lebret et al., 2016; Nan et al., 2021; Parikh et al., 2020) .

        "Time-series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various domains, including public health (Adhikari et al., 2019) , finance (Deb et al., 2017) , and energy (Tay and Cao, 2001) . Time-series forecasting (TSF), a crucial task in TS data analysis, aims to predict future events or trends based on historical data. Recent advancements in large Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), a.k.a. foundation models, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness for TSF tasks. This is achieved either by training TS foundation models from scratch (Yeh et al., 2023; Kamarthi and Prakash, 2023; Garza and Mergenthaler-Canseco, 2023; Das et al., 2023) or adapting LLMs to TS data as natural language modalities (Jin et al., 2023; Chang et al., 2023; Xue and Salim, 2023; Gruver et al., 2023) . These methods leverage powerful generalization capabilities of PTMs or LLMs, proving effectiveness in zero-shot (Gruver et al., 2023) and LSTPrompt.\nTSF tasks with promising applications without the need for domain-specific training data.\nDesigning proper prompting techniques for zeroshot TSF tasks offers notable advantages, which avoids training models from scratch or fine-tuning LLMs for computational efficiency while maintaining forecasting accuracy. Existing approaches (Xue and Salim, 2023; Gruver et al., 2023) prompt LLMs for zero-shot TSF tasks by aligning TS data with natural language sequences and prompting LLMs to perform TSF as sequence completion tasks. However, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of TS data and the intricate forecasting mechanisms inherent in TSF tasks, such as modeling temporal dependencies, which cannot be adequately modeled by simple sequence completion tasks.\nTo address the limitation, we introduce LST-Prompt, a novel prompt strategy of LLMs for TSF tasks by providing specific TSF-oriented guidelines. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We propose Long-Short-Term Prompt (LST-Prompt), which decomposes TSF into shortterm and long-term forecasting subtasks. Each subtask guides LLMs with distinct forecasting rules and mechanisms, forming a Chain-of-Thought reasoning path for predictions.\n\u2022 We introduce TimeBreath to LSTPrompt, an innovative component that encourages LLMs to regularly revisit forecasting mechanisms, enabling leveraging different forecasting mechanisms for different time periods.\n\u2022 We evaluate LSTPrompt on multiple benchmark and concurrent datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for zero-shot TSF tasks. We show its generalization ability to outperform non-zero-shot methods in specific scenarios.\nWe provide additional related works in the Appendix A with distinguishing the differences of popular zero-shot TSF methods in Table 3 .",
        "T HE real world is not static and consequently, manipu- lators must be up to the challenge of reacting to the unpredictable nature of the environment they work in. Getting a manipulator's end-effector from point A to point B is a fundamental problem in robotic control. While the task is seemingly simple, there can be numerous causes of failure, especially as the environment becomes cluttered and dynamic. Dynamic obstacle avoidance is essential for manipulators to be robust in such environments.\nEach iteration of the control loop must be able to consider the state of both environment and robot to guarantee safe and reliable robot operation. The current focus in obstacle avoidance for manipulators has come at the cost of greater upfront computational load, leading to open-loop motion plans. Planners compute a sequence of joint coordinates which at run time become joint velocities. In contrast, a reactive approach capable of avoiding non-stationary obstacles works directly with joint velocities. Fig. 1 : Our NEO controller drives a robot's joint velocities such that the robot does not collide with obstacles (that may be non-stationary), does not exceed joint position (translational or angular) or velocity limits and maximises the manipulability of the robot, purely reactively.\nWe consider the differential kinematics and compute a set of joint velocities that steer the end-effector towards the goal in task space. This classic and purely reactive approach is known as resolved-rate motion control (RRMC) and is cheap to compute and easily able to run at over 1000 Hz. In this paper we add additional capabilities to the RRMC approach while maintaining its highly reactive capability.\nDifferential kinematics also allows us to capture the rate of change of the distance between any part of the robot and any obstacle present in the environment. By exploiting such relationships, a reactive controller can be developed that will avoid colliding with obstacles. The resulting controller may be over-constrained and unable to achieve the goal pose, but we can employ two strategies to resolve this.\nFirstly, we could employ a kinematically redundant manipulator with more degrees of freedom than is necessary to reach any pose within its task space -these are now increasingly common.",
        "The explosion of the scientific enterprise has boosted the increase of high-quality scientific publication data [1, 2, 3, 4] , significantly attracting interest in utilizing data-driven methods to understand the process of scientific evolution [5] . Futurist Raymond Kurzweil, in his futuristic book The Singularity Is Near, predicts that human technological development will reach its limit in 2045, i.e. the arrival of the 'technological singularity' [6] . At this point, the intelligence of machines has far surpassed humans, causing it difficult for humans to understand the technology created by machines and ultimately making it impossible for humans to push civilization forward. In the current semiconductor industry, as we approach the atomic scale, chip manufacturing has become highly complex, and the increase in revenue becomes less significant [7] . At present, Moore's Law slowdown has become the industry consensus [8, 9, 10] , and soon, the chip miniaturization process will most likely end at 5 nm [11] . Singularity Theory and the slowdown of Moore's Law inspires us to think: Is there a similar life cycle of prosperity and extinction [12, 13, 14] in the current scientific evolution? By observing and counting the citation trends of 68 675 high-impact publications (citation \u2265 1000, covering 16 disciplines, published from 1800 to 2019), we find that the impact of publications is dominated by two underlying processes: birth and aging (Fig. 1 ). The phenomenon of 'aging' in high-impact articles indicates that although the scale of the scientific topics they lead are relatively large, the topics will not continue to develop.\nFigure 1 : Statistics on the moments of 'birth' and 'aging' of 68 675 high-impact papers. The height of the bar indicates the total number of high-impact articles that have been 'born' until certain moment; The dark blue part indicates the total number of high-impact articles that have 'aged' until certain moment. The moment when an article 'ages' is determined by the citation trend. When a high-impact article has no more than 10 new citations since a certain year, the article is considered to be 'aging' from that year; The light blue part of the bar represents the total number of articles that are still active up to the current moment. This figure shows that as high-impact articles continue to appear, some of them will gradually lose attention.\nHowever, current citation-based indicators [15, 16, 17, 18] only provide a suboptimal reference for the impact evolution of a single academic entity. It is hard to transfer directly from individual academic entities to the scientific topic formed by the interaction of these entities to explore the evolution of the topic.",
        "Termination analysis describes a classical decision problem in computability theory where program termination has to be determined. It is critical for many applications such as software testing, where nonterminating programs will lead to infinite executions. As proved by Turing in 1936, a general algorithm that solves the termination problem for all possible program-input pairs doesn't exist [60] . While there are a large number of works on termination analysis, the majority of them employ formal symbolic reasoning [15, 22, 23, 25, 33, 36] . In recent years, various attempts have been made to estimate termination behavior using neural networks. For instance, Giacobbe et al. [29] introduced an approach where neural networks are trained as ranking functions (i.e. monotone maps from the program's state space to well-ordered sets). A similar idea is employed in [3] , where Abate et al. use a neural network to fit ranking supermartingale (RMS) over execution traces. Given that program analysis tasks such as termination analysis are generally expected to provide formal guarantees, these works use satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers to show the validity of their results. While promising, they still face limitations specific to formal symbolic methods. Namely, programs need to be translated to a symbolic representation to generate the verification conditions that are then passed to the solver. Additionally, these verification conditions may be expressed in undecidable logical fragments or may require extra program invariants for the proof to succeed.\nIn this paper, we move away from formal methods and lean into the stochastic nature of machine learning models. Instead of looking for rigorous formal guarantees that can be interpreted by solvers, our objective is to provide an estimation of a program's termination behavior, as well as localizing the likely cause of nontermination (when applicable) that a programmer can use for debugging purposes. Our work also serves as a study of the applicability of machine learning techniques previously used for other classes of applications to program analysis. In particular, as explained next, we use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [66] and Graph Attention Networks (GANs) [61] .\nInstead of looking at execution traces like the aforementioned works, we are interested in using the source code with the assumption that it contains patterns that can assist in understanding its functionality. Notably, program analysis techniques generally work on source code, and specifically on graph representations of programs. To emulate this for machine learning, we make use of GNNs, which are a class of neural networks optimized to perform various analyses on graph-structured data. GNNs are gaining a lot of interest as they are being used to analyze graph-based systems denoting social networks [65] , physical systems [53] , knowledge graphs [34] , point-cloud classification [71] etc. Additionally, GNNs have recently been applied to program analysis tasks such as variable misuse detection and type inference [7] , and self-supervised bug detection and repair [9] .\nInspired by [7, 9] , we use GNNs to estimate program termination. Our baseline program termination classifier is based on the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) [40] .\nOn its own, estimating a program's termination behavior doesn't provide a lot of practical help a programmer interested in understanding and debugging a nontermination bug. Rather, we would like to provide additional information such as the code location corresponding to the likely root cause of the failure (in our case nontermination). This objective is similar to that of fault localization, which takes as input a set of failing and passing test cases, and produces a ranked list of potential causes of failure [41] .\nAs opposed to fault localization techniques, we are interested in investigating using the mechanisms of attention and semantic segmentation from machine learning. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to use attention and segmentation in the context of programs.",
        "Sequential recommender systems (SRSs), which model users' historical interactions and recommend potentially interesting items for users, have received considerable attention in both academia and industry due to their irreplaceable role in the real world systems, e.g., movie recommendation in Netflix 1 , and E-commerce recommendation in Amazon 2 . The success of SRSs heavily relays on users' engagement on the platform, which, to some extent, is reflected by users' immediate feedback, liking clicks [8, 40] . However, these immediate feedback can not completely reveal users' preferences [37] . For example, some items with eye-catching titles and covers but low-quality content may attract users' clicks and further break users' trust in the platform [35] . Therefore, it is essential to optimize users' long-term engagement at the platform [47] , liking user retention, which is a preferable indicator of user satisfaction.\nAs the tool for optimizing the long-term/delayed metrics [24] , reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely studied for optimizing user retention in recent years [6] . Though they are capable of exploring and modeling users' dynamic interests [39] , existing RL-based SRSs leave much to be desired due to the offline learning challenge. Unlike gaming scenarios, where RL agents achieve great success by trial and error search [29] , training from scratch in online SRSs is unaffordable due to the risk of losing users by recommending inappropriate items. Therefore, recent attention of the whole community has been paid to offline RL-based SRSs. However, putting offline RL into practice is frustrating in both valuebased and policy-based methods. For value-based approaches, the notorious instability problem (i.e., the 'Deadly Triad') pushes the development of model-based mothods [5] . However, due to the vast state space in the recommendation scenario, estimating the transition probability is a problem and further leads to unsatisfactory performance [42] . For policy-based methods, the unbounded variance of counterfactual policy evaluation drives the community to clip or discard the counterfactual weights [3] , which might lead to inaccurate weight and discourage performance [36] .\nTo explore the potential of RL-based recommendation, we propose to optimize the user retention recommendation with Decision Transformer [2] (DT), which casts the offline RL as an autoregressive problem and therefore solves the mentioned offline learning challenges. Specifically, DT is required to generate the recommendation under a specific reward, i.e., the user retention and state. When conditional on optimal reward, DT can generate future actions that achieve the desired return in the recommendation stages. Though DT is promising in the recommendation, applying the DT in SRSs is a non-trivial problem. It has the following challenges: (1) deficiency in reward modeling. Reward, as the most crucial part of DT, directly affects the quality of the recommendation. However, in DT, translating the reward into embedding ignores its partial order, leading to the deficiency in model training. (2) discrepancy in recommendation generation.",
        "The growing usage of microservice-based applications, Systems-of-Systems (SoS), and Internet-of-Things (IoT) services make effective and highly-dynamic monitoring of paramount importance to ensure seamless operations in the face of growing complexity [1] . Despite applications can be enhanced with monitoring capabilities through code instrumentation techniques (e.g., Kieker Framework [2] , Open-Telemetry [3] , Prometheus client libraries [4] ), this is not always possible as in the case of legacy or third-party systems, where monitoring activities have to be performed by employing external probes 1 .\nState-of-the-art monitoring systems using external probes can be adapted to changes by only performing expensive probe-level operations, such as redeploying or reconfiguring probes, to accommodate any change in the data collection strategies [5] . For instance, changing the set of collected indicators or changing the sampling rate of data collection using Prometheus [6] and its exporters [7] requires: (i) updating the Prometheus configuration to change the sampling rate (i.e., This work has been partially supported by the Centro Nazionale HPC, Big Data e Quantum Computing (PNRR CN1 spoke 9 Digital Society & Smart Cities); the Engineered MachinE Learning-intensive IoT systems (EMELIOT) national research project, which has been funded by the MUR under the PRIN 2020 program (Contract 2020W3A5FY); and the COmmunity-Based Organized Littering (COBOL) national research project, which has been funded by the MUR under the PRIN 2022 PNRR program (Contract P20224K9EK). 1 A probe is a software component responsible for collecting the raw data, such as sampling the CPU consumption of a service or recording the temperature in a room from a sensor.",
        "The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to a variety of adversarial examples is well documented. An adversarial example is a maliciously modified input that looks (nearly) identical to its original via human perception, but gets misclassified by a DNN model. This vulnerability remains a critical hurdle to the practical deployment of deep learning systems in safety-and mission-critical applications, such as autonomous driving or financial services.\nAdversarial attacks can be broadly divided by whether they assume white-box or black-box threat models. In the white-box setting, the attacker has total access to the target model, including its internal architecture, weights and parameters. Given a benign input, the attacker can directly compute adversarial examples as an optimization problem. In contrast, an attacker in the black-box setting can only interact with the model by submitting queries and inspecting returns. Blackbox scenarios can be further divided based on the information the classifier returns per query: score-based systems return a full probability distribution across labels, and decisionbased systems return only the output label.\nThe white-box threat model makes a strong assumption: an attacker has obtained total access to the model, through a server breach, a malicious insider, or other type of model leak. Both security and ML communities have made continual advances in both attacks and defenses under this setting -powerful attacks efficiently generate adversarial examples [11, 14, 26, 38, 70] , which in turn spur work on robust defenses that either prevent the generation of adversarial examples or detect them at inference time. While numerous approaches have been explored as defenses (e.g., model distillation [57] , gradient obfuscation [7, 20, 47, 61, 64, 77] , adversarial training [49, 83, 84] , and ensemble methods [67] ), nearly all have been proven vulnerable to followup attacks [3, [8] [9] [10] 29] .\nIn contrast, black-box attacks assume a more realistic threat model, where attackers interact with models via a query interface such as ML-as-a-service platforms [82] (See Fig 1) .",
        "3D multi-object tracking is a crucial component in an autonomous driving system as it provides pivotal information to facilitate various onboard modules ranging from perception, prediction to planning. LiDAR is the most commonly used sensor that a self-driving vehicle relies on to perceive its surroundings. Thus, tracking in LiDAR point clouds has been attracting increasing interests with the rapid development of self-driving vehicles in recent years.\nMulti-object tracking is a long-standing task in computer vision and has been extensively studied in image sequence domain. Arguably, the tracking-by-detection is the most popular tracking paradigm, which first detects objects for each frame and then associates them across frames. These methods have shown promising results and benefited from huge progress in image object detection. They usually formulate the association step as a bipartite matching problem. Most existing works therefore focus on better defining the * Correspondence to xiaodong@qcraft.ai affinity matrix between tracked objects and new detections. In the matching criteria design, the motion [2] and appearance [32] are widely adopted as the association cues.\nFor 3D multi-object tracking with LiDAR, the trackingby-detection pipeline also plays the dominant role [6, 27] . Accordingly, in order to obtain the final tracking result, current methods inevitably require a heuristic matching step to link detected objects over time in a separate stage. There exists numerous hand-crafted rules when performing such a step. As compared in the supplementary material, different matching criteria and corresponding threshold for each specific object class substantially impact the final tracking performance. This also happens in the track life management, which is used to handle new-born objects and dead tracks. It is a common practice for these methods to initialize a track only when an object continuously presents for a certain number of frames in order to filter out false detections, and keep disappeared objects for several frames to tackle occlusion. Unfortunately, all these heuristic rules are not trainable and highly depend on their hyper-parameters that demand huge efforts to tune. What is worse, such rules and hyper-parameters are often data and model dependent, making it hard to generalize and laborious to re-tune when applying to new scenarios.\nThe main reason for the requirement of an additional heuristic matching step is the lack of connection between frames in conducting object detection. Recently, some methods [18, 31] estimate velocity or predict the location of an object in consecutive frames to provide such a connection across frames. However, they merely treat the forecasted detections as a bridge for object matching instead of using them as the final tracking output. Moreover, they only take into account the location relationship of objects between frames, without modeling the confidence for the association.",
        "Autonomous driving (AD) is a long-researched area and a number of novel motion planning algorithms for AD have been proposed. Nevertheless, AD remains a major challenge. Traditional motion planning algorithms concentrate on the rule-or optimization-based methods [1] , [2] . However, these rules or models are designed manually with potentially inaccurate assumptions and thus, cannot scale to different real and complex scenarios, e.g., overtaking, roundabouts, interactions, and merging. This drawback has prompted communities to turn to learning-based approaches, which bear the promise of leveraging data to automatically learn complex driving policies. Among these approaches, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), embracing the perception capability of the deep neural network (DNN) and the decision-making capability of reinforcement learning (RL), has been widely investigated for AD tasks [3] , [4] .\nY. Yu and J. Liu are with National Engineering Laboratory for Integrated Aero-Space-Ground-Ocean Big Data Application Technology, the School of Cybersecurity, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710072, P.R.China (corresponding author: Jiajia Liu).\nDRL has been successfully used to address many sequential decision-making issues [3] , [5] - [7] . Given different requirements of driving (e.g., speed, safety, and comfort), an DRL-augment AD system takes behaviors of the autonomous vehicle (AV) and surrounding human driving vehicles (HDVs) and the knowledge about road networks as input, and outputs vehicle control commands, e.g., steering, torque, and brake. The success of DRL depends on a large amount of training data and computing resources. However, the cost of human driving data collection at a large scale can be prohibitive. This dilemma can lead to the fact that, the DRL model is still not only prone to unexpected behavior in out-of-sample scenarios [8] , [9] , but also may be injected with malicious backdoors (also called \"neural Trojan\", or \"Trojan attack\") [10] , [11] .\nIn this paper, we focus on the backdoor threat to DRLaugment AD through manipulating its training stage. Many existing neural Trojans can be injected into AV's capacities of vision perception [10] , [12] , e.g., image classification, object recognition and tracking. A backdoored DNN model behaves normally on benign samples, but can produce malicious results once an attacker-specified trigger is presented in the input (images or other sensor data). Unlike these supervised learning, DRL is required to address sequential decisionmaking problems according to long-term rewards instead of supervision on immediate rewards. Backdoors on DRL are more challenging since the backdoored agent needs to disrupt the sequential decisions rather than isolated decision while maintaining good performance in absence of backdoor triggers [13] . Hence, until now, there are still a few of related works. Kiourti et al. [13] use image patterns as the backdoor trigger and manipulate the corresponding action and reward when the trigger is present. Ashcraft et al. [14] studied a DRL backdoor that uses the action trajectory presented in the image observation as the trigger. [11] is the only work that studied backdoors to DRL-based AD, in which, the authors used the combinations of vehicles' speeds and positions as the trigger and studied congestion and insurance attacks in the circuit scenario. These backdoor triggers are useful for DRL-based AD and motivate us to investigate stealthier and more practice backdoors that can be easy to be activated by real-world attackers.\nThe DRL agent learns its optimal policy through interaction with the environment. Most DRL methods assumes that the state of the environment is fully observable for the agent. However, due to occlusions and noisy sensors of AV, the DRL agent can only glimpse a part of the system state.",
        "Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] have gained much attention in data generation. SBDMs perturb target data to a Gaussian noise by a diffusion process and learn the reverse process to transform the noise back to the target data. The conditional SBDMs [2, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] that are conditioned on class labels, text, low-resolution images, etc., have shown great success in image generation and translation. The condition data and target data in the conditional SBDMs [2, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] are often paired. That is, we are given a condition for each target sample in training, e.g., in the super-resolution [10, 14, 15] , each high-resolution image (target data) in training is paired with its corresponding low-resolution image (condition). However, in real-world applications, there could not be sufficient paired training data, due to the labeling burden. Therefore, it is important and valuable to develop SBDMs for applications with only unpaired or partially paired training data, e.g., unpaired [16] or semi-paired [17] image-to-image translation (I2I). Though there are several SBDM-based approaches [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] for unpaired I2I, the score-based models in these approaches are often unconditioned, and the conditions are imposed in inference by cycle consistency [21] , designing the initial states [19, 22] , or adding a guidance term to the output of the unconditional score-based model [18, 20] . It is unclear how to train the conditional score-based model with unpaired training dataset. For the task with a few paired and a large number of unpaired data, i.e., partially paired dataset, there are few SBDMs for tackling this task, to the best of our knowledge. This paper works on how to train the conditional score-based model with unpaired or partially paired training dataset.",
        "With the rapid development of wireless communications, mobile edge computing (MEC) has received widespread attention due to its potential in meeting low-latency and highbandwidth requirements [1] . MEC technology brings data processing closer to the user end, thereby reducing the distance and time of data transmission in the network, and improving processing speed and efficiency [2] , [3] . However, with the explosive growth of the number of devices and data volume, existing MEC solutions face challenges in signal coverage and network capacity.\nRecently, fluid antenna (FA) [4] , also known as movable antenna [5] , as an emerging technology in the field of wireless communications, has attracted widespread attention for its ability to boost system performance through dynamic antenna adjustments. Studies explored the basic principles of FA technology, such as the study of a new spatial block correlation model for FA systems [6] . Moreover, existing works focused on FA's performance in specific wireless communication scenarios, such as the FA-assisted multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communication systems [7] , [8] and the multiuser uplink communication systems based on FA [9] . These studies demonstrate the potential of FA in improving spectral efficiency, reducing transmit power, and optimizing signal receiving quality. Meanwhile, the combination of FA with Yiping Zuo, Biyun Sheng, Chen Dai, and Fu Xiao are with the School of Computer Science, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210023, China (Email: zuoyiping@njupt.edu.cn, biyunsheng@njupt.edu.cn, daichen@njupt.edu.cn, xiaof@njupt.edu.cn).\nJiajia Guo and Shi Jin are with the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China (email: jiajiaguo@seu.edu.cn, jinshi@seu.edu.cn).\nother emerging technologies, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces [10] and massive MIMO [11] , opens a new dimension in wireless communication system design.\nGiven FA's inherent advantages, FA has the potential to address the challenges faced by MEC, such as reducing system delays and enhancing resource utilization efficiency. In this letter, we propose a novel FA-enabled MEC scheme, which aims to minimize the total system delay and improve MEC service quality by dynamically optimizing antenna positions and computing resource allocation. Specifically, this letter introduces a novel FA-enabled MEC scheme. Then, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the total delay and design an alternating iterative algorithm based on the interior point method and particle swarm optimization (IPPSO) to find the optimal solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPPSO-based algorithm has good convergence.",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic is shaping up to be among the biggest disasters for humanity since World War 2 [46] . As of November, 2020, over one million people have died due to it, and the eventual fatality number will likely be in the millions. The financial damage is going to be trillions of dollars [14, 63] . One proven tool we can use to fight against highly infectious diseases like COVID-19 is contact tracing, and case investigation [2] . To trace disease transmission, public health personnel (e.g., contact tracers) work with people who have been tested positive (which we call patients) to help them remember everyone with whom they have had close contact during the time they may have been infectious. Exposed persons (contacts) are then notified of their potential exposure and possibly quarantined if tested positive. Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to help them understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, and how to monitor themselves for illness [2] .\nTraditional contact tracing requires extensive manual efforts and scales poorly, as contact tracers need to interview patients to identify contacts. Furthermore, some contacts, such as those in public transportation and public areas like airplanes and bars, are inherently difficult to identify. These factors led some experts to conclude early on that containment of COVID-19 has failed, and the society should move on to the mitigation phase [60] . However, the tremendous human and economic damage caused by COVID-19 led all societies to take dramatic measures to help curtail or at least slow down the transmission of COVID-19.\nTechnologies can potentially help automate the contact tracing process, reducing the cost and improving accuracy at the same time. A wide range of technologies have been applied. For example, revealed to different parties. We analyze how the two design dimensions impact these properties, and how specific features of existing protocols impact them.\nContributions. To summarize, our paper has the following contributions.",
        "Error correction of data storage in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has recently gained a lot of attention from the coding theory community. This attention increased after several successful experiments [2] - [15] that demonstrated the viability of using synthetic DNA as a reliable medium for data storage. As a result of the pioneering DNA storage experiments, several information-theoretic problems have been identified. The most important problem to our work is reliable communication over channels that introduce insertions, deletions, and substitutions (IDSs) [16] as the processes of DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing introduce errors in the forms of IDSs. Furthermore, in the literature, channels that introduce IDSs have been proposed to model synchronization errors. Thus, Parts of this work have been presented at the 2020/2021 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW) [1] .\nThe work of A. Lenz, L. Welter, and A. Wachter-Zeh has been supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement No. 801434).\nThe work of A. Graell i Amat was supported by the Swedish Research Council under grant 2020-03687 and by a Technical University of Munich Global Visiting Professor Fellowship. coding techniques are an indispensable component to cope with IDSs and improve the reliability of DNA storage systems and channels that are prone to desynchronization.\nWork on synchronization errors began decades ago. Several papers in the 1960s-70s have dealt with information-theoretic aspects of IDS errors, some even proposed codes to correct these errors [17] - [21] . From these works, several constructions of error-correcting codes for the IDS channel have been proposed in the last decade. Among the most important ones, and most relevant to our work, is the one introduced by Davey and MacKay [22] . In that paper, the authors introduce a concatenated coding scheme composed of an inner block code and an outer low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. In addition, they propose a decoding algorithm based on dynamic programming that represents the inner code and channel by a hidden Markov model (HMM). By doing so, the decoding algorithm allows to infer a posteriori probabilities (APPs) to be passed to the outer decoder, which will complete the message recovery process. Inspired by Davey and MacKay's work, the Markov process of convolutional codes was extended to the IDS channel, allowing for decoding algorithms of convolutional codes to be run for the IDS channel [23] , [24] . An improvement of the decoding algorithm in [22] was introduced in [25] . Furthermore, marker codes were used as inner codes in [26] , which improved the performance of the inner codes of [22] . Additionally, standalone codes (i.e., without an inner code) such as LDPC codes in [27] and polar codes in [28] , [29] were studied to tackle synchronization errors.\nMost of these studies have focused on error correction for a single block transmission over an IDS channel.",
        "Domain shift is common in many natural language processing (NLP) applications. For example, the word \"rechargeable\" is much more common in electronics product reviews than in book reviews, while the word \"readable\" is much more common in book reviews. Existing language models [4, 15] have exhibited outstanding performance in text classification tasks, but they fail to generalize to new domains without expensive labeling and retraining (Figure 1 ). To break out the data constraint, some methods with unlabeled data have been proposed as follows.\nFigure 1 : Language models perform worse when domain shift is present. The figure shows the cross-validation results of BERT baseline models trained on 5 domains. The prediction accuracy of the models tested on the trained domain is 5-15% higher than those tested on distant domains.\nExisting unsupervised domain adaptation methods for text classification can be grouped into two categories: task-agnostic methods [16, 7, 12, 9] and pivot-based methods. Task-agnostic methods generally ignore the correlation among words across domains, which can contain rich semantic information in an NLP context. In contrast, pivot-based methods use domain-independent words (pivots) to bridge the domain gap by leveraging the correlations between pivots and non-pivots to learn domain-invariant features. Therefore, we would like to marry pivot-based method and pretrained language models to adapt them to novel domains.\nThe most prominent pivot-based methods are Structure Correspondence Learning (SCL) and its variants [2, 25, 27] . In SCL, the pivots are defined as the words that occur frequently on both source and target domains and behave in similar ways that are discriminable for the classification task 3 . The model can effectively learn domain-invariant features for pivots, but it is more challenging for the non-pivots as they have domain-specific meanings. Therefore a self-supervised auxiliary task is applied to predict the pivots from the non-pivots. As a result, SCL implicitly captures the relationships between words by recognizing co-occurrence patterns between pivots and non-pivots and uses these relationships to infer domain-invariant features for the non-pivots. However, SCL is limited in that it uses all non-pivots to predict the pivot terms, which leads to a noisy inference problem as very few non-pivots have a real relationship with the pivots. As a result, false correlations often occur for frequently used words such as pronouns (see Figure 2a ). Alternatively, Knowledge Graphs (KG) is an effective way to represent complex relationships between concepts in a structured format and do not solely rely on noisy co-occurrence information. Therefore, in this paper, we present a pivot-based domain adaptation method from the KG perspective. Our method, called Domain Adaptation with Structured Knowledge (DASK), follows a 2-step approach as illustrated in Figure 2b .",
        "3D single object tracking (SOT) is crucial for various applications, such as autonomous driving [1] - [3] . It aims to localize a specific target across a sequence of point clouds, given only its initial status. Existing tracking approaches [4] , [5] commonly adopt the point-wise representation, directly taking raw point clouds as input. For example, P2B [4] and its follow-up works [6] - [8] adopt a point-based network [9] , [10] with the Siamese architecture for feature extraction, followed by a point-wise appearance matching module [4] , [8] , [11] for propagation of target cues, and a 3D Region Proposal Network [12] , [13] for target localization, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). M2-Track [5] proposes a motion-centric paradigm, that first segments the target points from their surroundings Fig. 1 : Comparison with typical 3D SOT paradigms. Previous methods mainly rely on the point-wise representation, and decompose the tracking problem into multiple subtasks, leading to a complicated tracking framework. On the contrary, our proposed BEVTrack performs tracking in BEV, greatly retaining the spatial information and thus simplifying the tracking pipeline while improving the performance. with a PointNet [14] segmentation network and then localizes the target through a motion modeling approach followed by a box refinement module, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b) .\nAlthough these approaches have exhibited superior performance in tracking benchmarks, they usually require elaborate designs [8] , [11] , [15] , [16] and solving multiple subtasks [4] , [5] to establish target correspondences across consecutive frames, resulting in complicated tracking frameworks and challenges in hyper-parameter tuning. It is noteworthy that such correspondences naturally exist as objects exhibit continuous motion within the video sequence [17] , [18] . This spatial continuity offers valuable prior knowledge for target localization, whereas the point-wise representation [9] , [14] with irregular formats fails to utilize it.\nIn this paper, we present BEVTrack, a simple yet strong baseline for 3D SOT, as shown in Fig. 1(c ). Converting unordered point clouds into the BEV representation [19] - [21] , BEVTrack greatly exploits spatial information and inherently encodes the implicit motion relations of the target as well as distractors in BEV. Specifically, we first adopt a voxelbased network [19] with the Siamese architecture for feature extraction. Subsequently, we squeeze the sparse 3D features along the height dimension to obtain the BEV features.",
        "For most of the constant-coefficient (elliptic) partial differential equations (PDEs) of classical mathematical physics, exact forms of the solution operator, or Green's function, are widely known and often used to transform boundary value problems into boundary integral equation formulations. In many situations, the resulting integral equations are the preferred formulation for solving the problem numerically due to their conditioning properties and their ease of handling complex geometries (including unbounded ones). As a result of incredible development over the past 20-30 years in areas such as hierarchical linear algebra, fast multipole methods, quadrature for singular functions, and computational geometry, obtaining high-order accurate solutions of PDEs via integral equation formulations is becoming more and more commonplace.\nHowever, for the majority of PDEs, which are in general not constant-coefficient, the associated analytical and numerical machinery is virtually non-existent due to the absence of known Green's functions (and even ones that are known present difficulties, due to their non-translationalinvariance). Almost all numerical approaches rely on a direct discretization of the differential operator via finite elements or finite difference schemes. However, often times an approximate Green's function, also known as a parametrix, can be constructed that can transform the PDE into an integral equation, albeit with kernels that need not satisfy the underlying homogeneous PDE themselves. A particular class of such elliptic PDEs that are of interest are what we call surface PDEs.\nElliptic PDEs on a surface are an extension of the corresponding problems in the plane. To be more precise, we let \u0393 be a smooth closed surface embedded in R 3 , and \u2207 \u0393 \u2022 and \u2207 \u0393 be the intrinsic surface divergence and surface gradient on \u0393 . We then define an elliptic PDE along \u0393 to be one of the form\n\u2207 \u0393 \u2022 a\u2207 \u0393 u + b \u2022 \u2207 \u0393 u + cu = f. (1.1)\nAbove, the goal is to find a function u given some known function f , some smooth and positive function a, some continuous tangential vector field b, and some continuous function c. Our assumptions on these functions and the geometry will be made more explicit later on in the manuscript.\nA particularly important surface elliptic problem is the Laplace-Beltrami problem, in which we wish to find a u such that\n\u2206 \u0393 u := \u2207 \u0393 \u2022 \u2207 \u0393 u = f. (1.2)\nThe operator \u2206 \u0393 is known as the Laplace-Beltrami operator and is the surface equivalent of the Laplace operator.",
        "We currently approach robot sensors from the perspective of consumers, purchasing whatever seems necessary from a catalogue, then writing program code to make robots useful. This perspective puts practical constraints up front: it is influenced by technologies that are currently available, it limits options to what can be fabricated cheaply and sold profitably. Worse, it relies on roboticists to reason (often only heuristically) about the information needed for a robot to achieve its goals. If there is some notion of task structure, reasoning about it is seldom formalized, and may be tied to assumptions often taken for granted (e.g., for fixed price, greater sensor precision is better). This paper approaches the question of sensors from a more fundamental perspectiveasking how we might represent and explore conceivable sensors. It is, therefore, of a more theoretical nature.\nWhich sensors are necessary depends on what your robot wants to do. We study robots that act to attain goals while managing uncertainty, formulating these precisely as planning problems, under worst-case non-determinism. Unlike many papers entirely focused on finding plans, this paper examines ways in which sensors affect whether a planning Yulin Zhang and Dylan A. Shell are with the Dept. of Computer Science, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.\nThis work was supported by the NSF through awards IIS-1453652 and IIS-1527436. Fig. 1 : A wheeled robot (as a blue disk) needs a charging station (the lightning bolts), but is slightly lost (the uncertainty in its initial pose is shown visually, as three possibilities). Unable to navigate stairs, it must avoid those locations lest it topple down a stairwell. The robot is able to recharge its battery despite the presence of uncertainty, with the help of either a camera, a simple linear distance sensor, or a short-range scanning lidar. (If bumping into walls is permitted, a sensorless plan is possible as well.)\nproblem can be solved. The perspective is that sensor choices alter the set of feasible plans, and we look at sensor/plan pairs jointly. We examine the space of sensors that are useful with respect to a specific given problem. These sensors, indeed especially those that provide little information, can be enlightening. Still, we do require they provide information to make progress toward goals [1] , even in the presence of uncertainty. We are interested in exploring all sensors, including even hypothetical ones, for which there exists some goal-achieving plan.\nFig. 1 shows a simple didactic scenario illustrating multiple aspects of the problem: a robot, uncertain about its initial position and incapable of navigating stairs, needs to reach a charging station.",
        "Uniform approximation of functions is considered an early example of an optimization problem with a nonsmooth objective function, providing several textbook examples for convex analysis [43] and semi-infinite programming (SIP) [31] . The natural connections between approximation theory and optimization, both aim at finding the \"best\" solution, were first forged as interest grew in the application of convex analysis within Functional Analysis in the '50s, '60s, and '70s [16, 24, 39, 40] . In 1972, Laurent published his book [43] , where he demonstrated interconnections between approximation and optimization. In particular, he showed that many challenging (Chebyshev) approximation problems could be solved using optimization techniques. For example, one can approximate a nonsmooth function using a piecewise polynomial function (i.e., splines). However, the complexity of the corresponding optimization problems is increased, especially when the location of spline knots (points of switching from one polynomial to another) is unknown. Therefore, in this perspective, rational approximations can be considered a good compromise between approximation accuracy and computational efficiency.\nIt has been known for several decades [12, 48] that the optimization problems that appeared in rational and generalized rational approximation are quasiconvex (generalized rational approximation in the sense of [48] , where the approximations are ratios of linear forms). One of the simplest methods for minimizing quasiconvex functions is the socalled bisection method for quasiconvex optimization [12] . The primary step in the bisection method is solving convex feasibility problems. Some feasibility problems are hard, but there are several efficient methods [6, 78, 79, 80] , to name a few. In the case of rational approximation, the feasibility problems we observe in the bisection method can be reduced to solving (large-scaled) linear programming problems and, therefore, can be solved efficiently.\nThis paper focuses on an optimization approach for the min-max (uniform) approximation. Perhaps surprisingly, we show in [60] that from the optimization perspective, the min-max problem is more tractable than the corresponding least squares.",
        "The extensive use of AI techniques in decision-making systems is significantly increasing the need for verification of the safety and reliability properties of probabilistic computations. The possibility of formal verification of such properties would grant the ability to consider such systems trustworthy. Nowadays, several approaches to the verification of AI systems are emerging, see [1, 2] for overviews. Notably, approaches are focusing on model-checking techniques for safety, liveness and fairness properties, see e.g. [3, 4] , program analysis and synthesis, see e.g. [5] or proof-checkers see e.g. [6, 7] for their increasing use also at industrial level. In the technical literature, though, little is available on the formalization of a notion of trustworthiness itself in this context, while current logical approaches to computational trust in general are overviewed in Section 2.\nIn this paper we introduce a derivation system dubbed Trustworthy Probabilistic Typed Natural Deduction (TPTND for short). The aim of this system is to formalize the task of inferential reasoning about probabilistic computational processes, in particular about their trustworthiness. We consider samples of such processes with corresponding frequencies and reason about their distance from corresponding theoretical probabilities. We start by defining an operational semantics to consider a probability space in which such computations can be thought to be evaluated. This operational semantics defines events whose results have a certain probability to occur, and generalizes to samples of such events with frequencies of observed outputs. We then transform such terms under operations for update, conjunction, disjunction and dependency of outputs.\nA full probabilistic \u03bb-calculus for samples of experiments and trust evaluation (but no other operations) is offered in [8] .\nReasoning about such probabilistic computations is given in the form of logical rules in the language TPTND, for deriving theoretical probabilities, expected probabilities and frequencies. Accordingly, judgements of our language are sequents of the form \u0393 $ \u03c6 where: \u0393 is a set of assumptions on random variables and it is as usual called the context ; \u03c6 is a typed formula in one of the following forms:\n\u2022 x : \u03b1 a , declaring that a random variable x has been assigned value \u03b1 with theoretical probability a;\n\u2022 t n : \u03b1 \u00e3, declaring that the expected probability to obtain value \u03b1 in a sample of n trials of the process t is a;\n\u2022 t n : \u03b1 f , declaring that the frequency of value \u03b1 in a sample of n executed trials of process t is f .",
        "Recommendation systems (RS) form the backbone of a good user experience on various platforms, such as e-commerce websites, social media, streaming services, and more. RS solves the issue of information overload by helping users discover the information most pertinent to them. To provide personalized suggestions, RS collects user features such as gender, age, geographical information, etc., and past user activity on the platform. User feedback can be categorized as either explicit feedback, such as ratings, or implicit feedback, such as views, clicks, or time spent on an item.\nTraditionally, the user feature and interaction data is collected on a server, and RS models are trained centrally.

        "The growing need for compact, resource-constrained devices performing a variety of functions including but not limited to sensing, identification, and machine control has driven the development of lightweight cryptographic designs and algorithms. The highly evolving yet resource constrained environment raised countless security concerns. As a result, using traditional cryptographic primitives on these platforms while striking an optimum trade-off between compact implementation and security strength became difficult. In order to effectively resolve this issue, NIST lay the foundation for lightweight cryptography standardization in 2017 [1] , [2] . Stemming from the design principles of symmetric cryptography, Lightweight cryptography aims to provide security for Internet of Things (IoT) devices namely sensors, RFID tags, medical implants, smart cards, etc. Design choices such as small block and key size, simple round structure and key schedule and nominal implementation make lightweight ciphers the right choice to ensure a sufficient level of security using less power, computing and memory resources. As a result of NIST's call, a total of 57 proposals were submitted by research teams across the globe [3] . After two rounds of rigorous evaluation process, as described in NIST IR 8369 [4] , 10 candidates were shortlisted as finalists of the competition, see table 1 In the third and final round, candidates were evaluated on the basis of the claims made in terms of security strength against known attacks ( 112 bits or more); performance on both hardware and software environment; resilience against side channel and fault injection based attacks; and intellectual property rights [5] . As a result, in February 2023, NIST crowned ASCON family as the new lightweight cryptography standard [6] . The most important evaluation criteria for cryptographic algorithms is measuring their security strength against known attacks such as differential and linear cryptanalysis (and their variants), as well as implementation based attacks. Designers and cryptanalysts across the globe tried their level best to suffice this requirement. As a result, the competition finalists received a noticeable amount of third party security analysis, selective ones highlighted as follows:-\u2022 Cihangir T. performed key recovery using differential-linear attack on 4 & 5 rounds of ASCON with a time complexity of 2 15 & 2 33.1 [7] . In [8] , used undisturbed bits in sbox to perform impossible, truncated and improbable differential attacks on 4 and 5 round ASCON.",
        "Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017 ) has outperformed other methods on several neural language generation (NLG) tasks, like machine translation (Deng et al. 2018 ), text summarization (Chang, Huang, and Hsu 2018) , etc. Generally, Transformer is based on the encoder-decoder framework which consists of two modules: an encoder network and a decoder network. The encoder encodes the input sentence into a sequence of hidden states, each of which corresponds to a specific word in the sentence. The decoder generates the output sentence word by word. At each decoding time-step, the decoder performs attentive read (Luong, Pham, and Manning 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) to fetch the input hidden states and decides which word to generate.\nAs mentioned above, the decoding process of Transformer only relies on the representations contained in these hidden states. However, there is evidence showing that hidden states from the encoder in Transformer only contain local representations which focus on word level information. For example, previous work (Vaswani et al. 2017; Devlin et al. 2018; Song et al. 2020) showed that these hidden states pay much attention to the word-to-word mapping; and the weights of attention mechanism, determining which target word will be generated, is similar to word alignment.\nAs Frazier (1987) pointed, the global information, which is about the whole sentence in contrast to individual words, should be involved in the process of generating a sentence. Representation of such global information plays an import role in neural text generation tasks. In the recurrent neural network (RNN) based models (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014) , Chen (2018) showed on text summarization task that introducing representations about global information could improve quality and reduce repetition. Lin et al. (2018b) showed on machine translation that the structure of the translated sentence will be more correct when introducing global information. These previous work shows global information is useful in current neural network based model. However, different from RNN (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014; Cho et al. 2014; Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014) or CNN (Gehring et al. 2016; 2017) , although self-attention mechanism can achieve long distance dependence, there is no explicit mechanism in the Transformer to model the global representation of the whole sentence. Therefore, it is an appealing challenge to provide Transformer with such a kind of global representation.\nIn this paper, we divide this challenge into two issues that need to be addressed: 1). how to model the global contextual information? and 2). how to use global information in the generation process?, and propose a novel global representation enhanced Transformer (GRET) to solve them. For the first issue, we propose to generate the global representation based on local word level representations by two complementary methods in the encoding stage. On one hand, we adopt a modified capsule network (Sabour, Frosst, and Hinton 2017) to generate the global representation based the features extracted from local word level representations.",
        "Visual navigation is at the core of most autonomous robotic applications such as self-driving cars or service robotics. One of the main challenges for the robot is to efficiently explore the environment, to robustly identify navigational space, and eventually be able to find the shortest paths in complex environments with obstacles. The Robotics and Deep Learning communities have introduced models trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), Inverse RL, or Imitation Learning, targeting complex scenarios requiring visual reasoning beyond waypoint navigation and novel ways to interact with robots, e. g., combining vision, robotics, and natural language processing through queries like \"Where are my keys?\". Current learning algorithms are not sampled efficiently enough, this kind of capability requires an extremely large amount of data. In the case of RL, this is in the hundreds of millions or in the billions of interactions -this simply cannot be addressed in a reasonable amount of time using a physical robot in a real environment, which also may damage itself in the process.\nTo tackle this issue, the field heavily relies on simulation, where training can proceed significantly faster than in physical (wall clock) time on fast modern hardware, easily distributing multiple simulated environments over a large number of cores and machines. However, neural networks trained in simulated environments often perform poorly when deployed on real-world robots and environments, mainly due to the\"Sim2Real gap\", -i. e. the lack of accuracy and fidelity in simulating real-world environment conditions such as, among others, image acquisition conditions, sensors noise, but also furniture changes and other moved objects. The exact nature of the gap is often difficult to pinpoint. It is well known that adversarial examples, where only a few pixel shifts occur, considered as small artifacts by humans, or which might even be undetectable by humans, can directly alter the decisions of trained models [12, 27, 20] .",
        "F ACIAL expression is one of the most important ways for people to express their emotions [1] . Facial Expression Recognition (FER) requires that the computer program could automatically recognize the expression from an input face image. The FER task has attracted broad interest in the computer vision community [2] , [3] , [4] due to its wide applications in human-computer interactions, medical progress monitoring, driver fatigue monitoring, and many other fields.\nHowever, FER is a very challenging task, especially in the wild. This is mainly because of the significant intraclass variances and inter-class similarities among expression categories, which differ from the general image classification task. For example, the same people in the same illumination and pose may have different expressions, while people with different identities, ages, gender, and pose may express the same emotion. In the past few years, with the development of the convolutional neural network, many methods [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] have been proposed and greatly improve the performance of FER. Recently, the Vision Transformer (ViT) was proposed for image classification [11] and achieved promising performance with the non-local self-attention mechanism. It shows great potential for solving visual tasks. Some researchers adopt the ViT for FER [10] , [12] , [13] . However, the performance is inferior to the state-of-the-art CNNs except TransFER [10] . The main issue is that the ViT needs a large amount of data to train due to a large number of parameters and lacks the inductive bias [11] . Existing FER datasets are much smaller compared to general image classification datasets (i.e. ImageNet [14] ), making it hard for newly proposed Transformer-based modules to converge well and are easy to mistakenly focus on some occlusion or background areas. Many regularization [15] , [16] and attention [6] , [8] , [10] , [13] , [17] methods have been proposed to address this issue. The TransFER model generates an attention map and multiplies it with the feature maps to reduce the impact of noisy features. We investigated the TransFER model and find that the model has learned to distinguish informative areas from noisy areas (as illustrated in Fig. 1 ). However, the noisy features are still fed into the downstream models in TransFER. Hence, we raise a question: Why do we still compute noisy features even though we have already known they are noises?\nBenefiting from the flexible design of the Transformer model, it could adopt any number of tokens as input without changing the model parameters. Inspired by this, we propose the APP module to discard the noisy features directly. As illustrated in the right part of Fig. 1 , the noisy features are now directly pooled (denoted as a small white grid) instead of multiplying with a small value.\nAs for the Transformer block, it is built based on the attention mechanism, making it more intuitive to perform attentive pooling. Recently, CPVT [18] found that using the global average pooling (GAP) to replace the [class] token could produce an even better performance. DeepViT [19] further investigated this phenomenon, finding that the attention maps become similar after particular layers. To reduce the redundancy in deep blocks, DeepViT [19] proposed a Re-attention method to increase the diversity of different layers, LV-ViT [20] proposed a token labelling strategy to give a label to every token to supervise.",
        "Moving towards Net-Zero for digital research infrastructures (DRIs), i.e. providing DRIs that do not have significant impacts on the climate or environment, requires robust information to enable good decision making around infrastructure procurement and provisioning. This requires understanding the full carbon costs or climate impacts associated with operating, maintaining, and using the infrastructure, going beyond accounting for the electricity and cooling required for operations of any service, and including the full chain of costs embodied in the infrastructure.\nIn this short paper we outline the work done during the IRISCAST project [2] to evaluate the full lifecycle climate emissions associated with an active DRI, both by cataloguing the resources that compose the DRI and by measuring energy consumption for a defined period of the operation of the DRI. To convert the collected data into impact on the climate of the DRI we have developed a carbon model to produced an overall figure for the climate impact of a 24 hour period (a snapshot) of operating the IRIS DRI.\nDuring this process we have identified many areas where data is either incomplete or of variable quality, signalling that much more For the rest of the paper, we will introduce the IRIS DRI, briefly discuss the IRISCAST approach, outline the carbon model we have designed, and then discuss the results of monitoring and evaluating the DRI for a 24 hour period to enable quantifying the climate impact of such a system.",
        "T HE need for equipping transmitters and receivers with multiple antennas in wireless communication systems has been recognized for over a century. The first observed benefit was the adaptive directivity achievable by controlling the constructive and destructive superposition of electromagnetic (EM) signals using an antenna array [1] , [2] . The transmitter can use this feature, traditionally referred to as beamforming, to focus a transmitted signal at the desired receiver while avoiding interference at specific locations. Similarly, the receiver can amplify signals impinging from a particular direction using multiple antennas while suppressing undesired interference. The second observed benefit was the higher robustness against channel fading achieved by using multiple antennas [3] - [6] , as it becomes less likely that all transmitreceive antenna pairs experience deep fades simultaneously as we increase the number of antennas and the array size. This feature is called spatial diversity and channel hardening [7] . The third and most recently discovered benefit is multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications [8] - [12] , where antenna arrays are used to spatially multiplex many layers of data at the same time and frequency. This can be done in multi-user MIMO mode, where a multiple-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple user equipments (UEs) simultaneously. This is enabled using adaptive beamforming: the BS gives each transmitted signal a different spatial directivity, has the ability to amplify signals received from UEs in different directions, and can filter out interference in both transmission directions. There is also the single-user The EM field looks different depending on the distance from the transmitting aperture antenna. The wavefront is almost planar in the far-field, while the spherical curvature is clearly noticeable in the radiative near-field but not reactive effects such as inductive coupling and evanescent waves.\nMIMO mode, where a multi-antenna BS and multi-antenna UE exchange multiple data layers simultaneously by beamforming through different propagation paths.\nThe MIMO technology was first introduced in cellular and WiFi networks as a premium feature but is nowadays a mainstream technology. The 5G technology was built around the Massive MIMO concept [13] of having a surplus of antennas at the BS compared to the UE side, which makes it practically feasible to protect the data layers from mutual interference through spatial filtering, even under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and hardware impairments [14] , [15] . A typical 5G BS in 2023 had 64 antenna ports and can support up to 16 data layers, such as 8 UEs assigned with two layers each. The driving force behind the MIMO adoption is the rapidly increasing demand for data traffic in cellular networks, currently growing by 40% per year [16] .",
        "D RIVEN by the need to perform tasks in remote envi- ronments, teleoperation has emerged as a central robotic paradigm with applications ranging from deep sea [1] to outer space [2] . In this paper, we propose an object-centered motion mapping framework for continuous bilateral teleoperation. Our main objective is to address the problem of generating smooth, goal-directed robot trajectories when discrepancies exist between operator and remote robot workspaces. This problem, illustrated in Fig. 1 with a valve turning example, remains largely unaddressed among the state-of-the-art teleoperation frameworks.\nFig. 1 : Valve turning experiment. The task consists of an operator kinesthetically guiding the local (left) robot to rotate four valves (in any preferred order) and the remote (right) robot executing the same behavior on its side, despite different valve poses. We consider four different valves on each workspace, where each pair has different poses with respect to the robot base (see colored circles). A vertical board prevents the user from relying on visual feedback to complete the task, emulating the realistic teleoperation of a remote robot.\nThe logical steps between naive joint space mappings and object-centered representations can be seen in Fig. 2 . Direct joint space mappings (Fig. 2(a) ) impose strong embodiment constraints. Hence most teleoperation frameworks rely on task space representations as in Fig. 2(b ). Despite that, even the most simple differences between local and remote environments can lead the remote robot to fail as in Fig. 2(c ). This favours object-centered approaches (Fig. 2(d) ) that are better but still tend to scale poorly with the number of objects (Fig. 2(e) ). A common approach to this issue is to suspend the communication between the haptic device and the remote robot, relocate the haptic device and continue the task based on visual feedback [3] , [4] (Section II will provide an overview). Nonetheless, the discontinuous manipulation leads to low efficiency and transparency, especially in tasks that involve multiple objects. In this paper we propose an approach that reshapes the task space to ensure that the robot adapts to points of interest that can differ on the two sides (Fig. 2(f) ). Particularly, our main contribution is an objectcentered formulation for task space motion mapping between the local and remote robot, with:",

        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of people's daily lives. AI has played a key role in driving innovations in fields such as healthcare (Toosizadeh et al. 2019) , banking (Netzer, Lemaire, and Herzenstein 2019) , military applications (Blitch 1996) , and space exploration (Hedberg 1997) . People are accustomed to relying on AI as tools to aid them in their daily activities ranging from scheduling to driving. In recent years, the role of AI has progressed from being tools to socially intelligent agents. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) is a popular area of research where AI agents are designed to work alongside human teammates to achieve common goals.\nTo be an effective teammate, an AI agent needs to be efficient at understanding, identifying, and predicting human behavior. AI agents capable of accurately predicting future behavior by observing the past can intervene and direct a team to be more efficient and enhance team performance. Such AI is highly sought after and have many real-world applications in areas such as game design, biomedical engineering (Cui, Chen, and Chen 2016) , and autonomous driving (Gopinath et al. 2022 ).\nHuman behavior is a complex process. In goal oriented tasks such as USAR, human behaviour has a hierarchical structure in association with short-term and long-term goals which unfold across multiple timescales. In order to accurately predict the future behaviour in such tasks, the model must be able to understand the hierarchical structure of human behavior. However, relatively little attention has been paid to modeling human behavior at multiple timescales. Models that incorporate features evaluated over multiple timescales are shown to perform better than models that tend to ignore them in applications such as driver drowsiness detection through facial videos (Massoz, Verly, and Van Droogenbroeck 2018) , automated speech recognition from raw speech signals (Takeda, Nakadai, and Komatani 2018) , and text classification (Liu et al. 2015) .\nWe present an LSTM network architecture that processes human behavioural information at multiple timescales to predict future behavior from past observations. We take inspiration from the works of Hihi and Bengio (1995) , Koutnik et al. (2014) and Liu et al. (2015) who designed LSTMs with delayed connections and units operating at different timescales. Our LSTM model takes two minutes of behavioral data as input and predicts thirty seconds of future behavior. Our results show that the LSTM model processing behavioral data at multiple timescales performs substantially better at predicting future behavior compared to the LSTM model that does not utilize multi-timescale modeling. We also compare our LSTM model performances to valid baseline measures that account for biases in the behavioral data such as class imbalance and biases resulting from the structure and design of the experiment. We test our hypothesis in an urban search and rescue (USAR) scenario simulated in a virtual Minecraft-based testbed that is designed as a part of DARPA's ASIST program (Huang et al. 2022) . In this scenario, the environment is dynamic with in-game perturbations, and the possibility of civilians dying if they are not rescued promptly. These elements make USAR a very demanding task and at the same time, a realistic and important testbed for adaptive AI development (Tr\u0203ichioiu and Visser 2015) .",
        "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are the most representative ways to store knowledge in the form of connections of entities. With the development of KG and relevant applications (e.g., Question Answering [9] , Information Retrieval [22] ) in recent years, the need for aligning KGs from different sources has become increasingly important in these fields. Entity Alignment (EA) in KGs, which aims to integrate KGs from different sources based on practical requirements, is a fundamental technique in the field of data integration.\nMost KGs derived from different sources are heterogeneous, which brings difficulties when aligning entities. Existing EA studies mainly make efforts to identify and leverage the correlation between heterogeneous KGs from various perspectives (e.g., entity names, structure information, temporal information) through deep learning techniques. GNN is one of the most popular techniques for mining graph-structured information. Along with the development of GNN-related techniques, over 70% studies of EA since 2019, according to the statistics [39] , have incorporated GNNs into their approaches. Benefiting from the strong ability of GNNs to capture KGs' structure correlations, related methods have achieved remarkable performance on benchmark EA datasets.\nHow to overcome the heterogeneity and mine the correlations between KGs is the main concern of EA. Existing EA methods evaluate the performance on several widely-used KG datasets, especially cross-lingual KGs (e.g., DBP15K(EN-FR)). However, the heterogeneity between KGs is not limited to linguistic differences. Different data sources, scales, structures, and other information (e.g., temporal information ) are more widespread heterogeneities among knowledge graphs, and need to be studied urgently in the EA area. The highly heterogeneous KGs (HHKGs) indicate that the source and target KG are far different from each other (e.g., General KG-Domain KG). Figure 1 vividly presents a toy example of HHKGs, in which KGs have different scales, structures, and densities, and the overlapping ratio is exceedingly low. For temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), the difference in temporal information can also be considered as a kind of heterogeneity. The above characteristics lead to the challenges of EA on HHKGs.\nThe requirements of practical applications reveal the indispensability of studying HHKG alignment. For example, personal KGs [1, 38] intend to integrate domain knowledge about people with general KG for personalized social recommendations; Geospatial database, which is today at the core of an ever-increasing number of Geographic Information Systems, needs to align entities from multiple knowledge providers [2] . These applications have urgent needs for EA on HHKGs. Unfortunately, most EA methods are evaluated on a few benchmarks, there is a lack of datasets for conducting research on HHKGs. This one-sided behavior hinders our understanding of the real progress achieved by EA methods, especially GNN-based methods, and results in the limitations of previous EA methods when applied in practical scenarios. In general, a rethinking of EA methods especially GNN-based methods is warranted. The goal of this work is to answer two essential research questions:\n\u2022 RQ1: From the dataset view, what are the existing EA datasets' limitations, and the gaps between them and practical scenarios? \u2022 RQ2: From the method view, what is the EA method that we really need in practical applications?\nTo answer RQ1, we conduct a rethinking of the existing EA datasets, and discuss the gap between them and practical scenarios through statistical analysis. Based on the analysis, we sweep the unreasonable assumption (e.g., KGs always satisfy 1-to-1 assumption of entities) and eliminate oversimplified settings (e.g., the excessive similarity of KGs in scale, structure, and other information) of previous datasets and propose two new entity alignment datasets called ICEWS-WIKI and ICEWS-YAGO.\nTo answer RQ2, we perform empirical evaluations across a wide range of representative EA methods on HHKG datasets.",
        "Large language models (LLMs) have been proven highly effective in solving complex reasoning tasks. One technique contributing to their success is the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) , which motivates the LLMs to perform multi-step reasoning instead of providing direct answers. This approach can significantly enhance the model's ability to handle challenging tasks such as arithmetic and symbolic questions.\nGenerally, the overall effectiveness of CoT relies on the quality of the demonstrations provided. When confronted with no examples but only the prompt \"Let's think step by step\", known as Zero-Shot-CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) , LLMs struggle with reasoning and encounter hallucination-related issues. While manually designing demonstrations for each question can alleviate such problems (Wei et al., 2022b) , it comes with a significant labour cost. To address such challenges, Zhang et al. (2023) propose Auto-CoT, which can automatically construct demonstrations as prompts. It initially partitions questions from a given dataset into clusters and then selects a representative question from each cluster. The selected questions are answered using Zero-Shot-CoT to obtain their rationales (the intermediate reasoning chain). The performance of this automated method is comparable to that of Manual-CoT.\nDespite the efficacy of the automated method, how to develop a sound and complete set of demonstrations remains an area for further exploration. Several studies advocate for incorporating external knowledge to ensure the accuracy of the intermediate reasoning chain (Zhao et al., 2023; Weng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024) . Others suggest generating multiple CoT paths, complemented by a verification process to maintain self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023b; Yao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) .\nHowever, most prior research focuses on the precision of demonstrations, with limited exploration of the distributional power inherent in these demonstrations. Enlightened by Min et al. (2022) and Madaan et al. (2023) , LLMs perform CoT through a counterfactual approach: it does not necessitate precise example results but rather learns from the underlying patterns (e.g. equations, templates) exhibited by the examples.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Pattern-Aware Chain-of-Thought (PA-CoT) and demonstrate that LLMs can achieve improved reasoning performance by embracing the diversity inherent in demonstration patterns. Following the Auto-CoT schema, we automatically generate question clusters and select representative questions from each cluster. However, instead of relying solely on question embeddings for clustering, we explore multiple methods to enrich the diversity of rationale patterns.",
        "The Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), a technique for restoring a visually pleasing high-resolution (HR) image from its low-resolution (LR) version, is still a challenging task within the computer vision research community [8, 13, 20, 22, 27, 28, 32, 33, 36] . Since multiple solutions exist for the mapping from LR to HR space, SISR is highly ill-posed and a variety of algorithms, especially the current leading learning-based methods are proposed to address this problem.\nUnderstanding what the SISR problem represents is crucial in order to develop a method that is capable of solving it. Having a low-resolution image at inference time means that there is no ground truth answer on how the highresolution counterpart image is generated. That being said, in order to recover a higher-resolution image, assumptions need to be made that do not violate the visible artifacts taken from the low-resolution image. The fine details added to the higher-resolution image are subjective, since they only need to follow certain already visible artifacts from the low-resolution image. The task in SISR is to find a model that learns how to make these assumptions and generate highresolution images as plausible as possible according to the specific task that is being undertaken like, Face SISR. To this day, all current solutions for the SISR problem attempt to reconstruct a single high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input image. In other words, the process of generating a high-resolution image is deterministic and given the same low-resolution image multiple times as input will yield the same high-resolution image.\nIn this paper, we argue that a method for solving the SISR problem should yield multiple high-resolution candidates for the same low-resolution image and we propose an approach to solve this problem.",
        "Special functions of a complex variable play a pivotal role in numerous questions arising from analysis, geometry, combinatorics and number theory. Examples include the link between the Riemann -function and the distribution of prime numbers, or the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture which relates special values of -functions to arithmetical invariants of elliptic curves. Being able to evaluate these functions at high precision is invaluable for computing invariants or testing conjectures, and work on fast algorithms for this task over the last decades often makes it possible nowadays to reach accuracies in the millions of digits [e.g. , 12] .\nAt the same time, mathematicians have realized that many complex special functions have interesting -adic analogues. A famous example is that of -adic -functions, which encode subtle invariants of towers of number fields (via Iwasawa's theory) and, more generally, of algebraic varieties. The algorithmic counterpart of these questions also has attracted some interest. Efficient algorithms have been designed for computing the Morita -adic \u0393-function [22, \u00a76.2] and, more recently, -adic hypergeometric functions [1, 15] and some -adic -functions [3] . On a different but closely related note, since the pioneering works of Kedlaya [14] , much effort has been devoted to computing the matrix of the Frobenius acting on the cohomology of -adic algebraic varieties [e.g., 17, 23] .\nThe present paper continues this dynamic and provides new efficient algorithms for evaluating many -adic elementary and special functions, including polylogarithms, hypergeometric functions and, more generally, solutions of \"small\" -adic differential equations. In particular, our methods apply to the large class of matrices of the Frobenius acting on the cohomology of a fibration, since they satisfy differential equations of Picard-Fuchs type.\nAn important feature of our algorithms is that they all run in quasi-linear time in the precision. This contrasts with most previous work where the complexity was at least quadratic.

Our algorithms also incorporate later improvements from [24, 19, 18] . We refer to Bernstein's survey [4, esp. \u00a712] for more history of the development of these techniques and further references.\nOur starting point is the existence of recurrence relations on the partial sums of series expansions of the functions we are evaluating. Roughly speaking, the binary splitting method consists in expressing the th partial sum as a product of matrices using this recurrence, and forming a balanced product tree to evaluate it (see \u00a74.1). This approach reaches the desired quasi-linear complexity when the evaluation point is a small integer.",
        "Achieving stable and robust locomotion on legged systems is a challenging control task due to underactuation, power limitations, and ground impacts. Two main approaches that have proven successful towards mitigating these challenges in the real world include: 1) generating stable reference trajectories [1] - [4] and modifying these behaviors online using regulators (such as modifying the swing foot location based on lateral velocity [5] , [6] ); and 2) determining the desired behavior of the robot in real time using online planning via model predictive control [7] - [10] or reinforcement learning [11] - [14] . In this work, we aim to improve these existing approaches by synthesizing robust reference trajectories. This is motivated by previous work, which has shown that optimizing the robustness of nominal trajectories improves overall performance regardless of the chosen method of online stabilization [15] , [16] , and that online planning strategies can have unpredictable behavior without the use of a reference trajectory [17] , [18] .\nIt is important to note that there exists previous work towards generating robust limit cycles [16] . However, these existing methods can be computationally expensive and do not scale easily to high-dimensional systems. Thus, the goal of this work is to develop a method of generating robust limit cycles in a way that is scalable to high-dimensional systems (such as the 18 degree-of-freedom (DOF) Atalante lower-body exoskeleton shown in Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 . This work improves the robustness of nominal reference trajectories (gaits) by evaluating the extended saltation matrix directly in the gait generation framework. The approach is demonstrated in simulation and on hardware for both the 7-DOF AMBER-3M planar biped (left) and the 18-DOF Atalante lower-body exoskeleton (right).\nOur approach for generating robust walking gaits builds upon the Hybrid Zero Dynamics (HZD) method [19] , [20] .",
        "Egocentric (first-person) action anticipation is an essential component of artificial intelligence and computer vision, with a wide range of application values. For example, in autonomous driving [30, 33] , vehicles need to determine whether pedestrians will cross the intersection based on their current and past behaviors. In humancomputer interaction systems [24, 35] , if machines can anticipate Observing action starting at time \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc60 -(\ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc5c ) and ending at time \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc60 -\ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc4e , the task objective is to anticipate future action at time \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc60 after an interval of \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc4e , where \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc60 represents the starting moment of the target action, \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc4e represents the anticipation time, and \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc5c represents the observation length. Due to the gap between the observed and future actions, anticipating the future is more challenging than recognizing the present. We propose to generate semantic features based on category labels or visual cues, then fuse them with visual features and input the fused features into an encoder-decoder model to anticipate future actions.\npeople's subsequent actions and provide feedback accordingly, it will bring a higher-quality experience for users.\nFormally, action anticipation is anticipating future actions based on current and historical observation data. As shown in Figure 1 , the future action \"Cut bell pepper\" is anticipated by observing the already occurred action \"Stir chicken. \" Besides the visible observation, the content of the anticipation stage and the target moment is invisible to the model.\nEgocentric action anticipation is highly challenging. Although both involve modeling observation data, action recognition aims to identify the current action category, while egocentric action anticipation seeks to anticipate future action. Future actions have apparent visual differences and logical connections with the current observations, making it difficult to fully understand the observed data and capture the relationship between it and future actions. The difficulty also results in generally low anticipation performance for mainstream methods that rely on visual information.",
        "A key challenge in machine learning (ML) is balancing specification and generalization (a.k.a. over-fitting and underfitting). We want a model that generalizes well (but not so simplistic that it underfits) and is well-specified to capture the essential patterns in the training data (but not so complex that it overfits). This subtle balance is often achieved through statistical techniques like cross-validation, regularization, and choosing the right model complexity. From a geometric perspective, the challenge is intrinsically related to the manifold structure of the data acquired from the physical world. To discover and exploit such manifold structure, nonlinearity is commonly believed to be essential, as witnessed by kernel trick in support vector machine [48] and nonlinear dimensionality reduction (e.g., IsoMAP [45] and locally linear embedding [40] ). However, nonlinearity is often at odds with rigorous proof and the simplicity criterion in mathematical and scientific research.\nIn this paper, we draw inspiration from the discovery of place cells [34] and its related aliasing problem [29] , [50] .\nThis work was partially supported by NSF IIS-2401748 and BCS-2401398.\nNature has discovered an elegant solution to efficient learning through the evolution of mammalian brains, but its secret has remained elusive. We shed some light on this greatest puzzle by revisiting the role of specification and generalization from a manifold untangling/tangling perspective [27] . Whitney's embedding theorem in topology [31] has shown that it is easier to untangle a manifold in a high dimensional space. Such intuition inspires us to introduce context dependency as the clue for manifold untangling. Using class labels C as contextual variables, we can show an arbitrary manifold P (X) can be untangled (admitting linear dichotomy [6] ) in the lifted space P (X, C). The opposite direction (tangling operator) is a simple integral transform that collapses/aliases all variables sharing the same context. By associating tangling/untangling with context-independent representation (CIR) and contextdependent representation (CDR), we rigorously show how to strike an optimal tradeoff between specificity and generalization by a pair of tangling and untangling operators, which we call tangling-untangling cycle (TUC).\nUsing TUC as the building block, we can construct more sophisticated learning algorithms based on Cartesian products and fractal geometry [28] . It can be shown that the Cartesian product of TUC is still a TUC, which supports the multiscale extension from low-dimensional to high-dimensional space. To mirror the nested structure of data acquired from the physical world, fractal-inspired extension is constructed where the interscale context dependency is induced by an index variable (a.k.a. positioning trick [26] ). The efficiency of the proposed learning algorithms is supported by their biological implementations based on polychronization neural groups (PNG) [24] . The implementation of TUC by sleep-wake cycle [13] finishes our journey at its starting point -the discovery of place cells in the hippocampus [34] . The presence and absence of external stimuli (i.e., default state vs. perturbation state) offer an energy-efficient and biologically plausible implementation of untangling and tangling operators in wake and sleep modes, respectively.",
        "Statistical shape modeling (SSM)/morphological analysis [28] is an important resource for medical and biological applications. SSM broadly involves two distinct parts, (i) shape representation which involves describing the anatomy/shape of interest by giving an implicit or explicit representation of the shape, and (ii) using the shape representation to perform the subsequent analysis on shape population. Classical approaches relied on representing the shape via landmark points, often corresponding to distinct anatomical features. There have been many automated approaches for dense correspondence discovery which captures the underlying shape statistics [10, 26] . An alternate approach to shape representation is to leverage coordinate transformations between images or geometries, typically members of a population or to a common atlas [19] . Such a set of transformations implicitly capture the population shape statistics for the objects/anatomies contained in those images.\nAutomated shape representation via dense correspondences has its drawbacks; most such methods rely on heavily preprocessed data. Such preprocessing steps might include segmentation, smoothing, alignment, and cropping. These tasks typically require manual parameter settings and quality control thereby making this preprocessing heavy on human resources. In several cases, especially for segmentation a degree of specific anatomical, clinical, or biological expertise is also required, introducing even higher barriers to engaging in shape analysis. Additionally, automated landmark placement or registration rely on computationally expensive optimization methods, and often require additional parameter tuning and quality control. This heavy preprocessing and complex optimization often make statistical shape analysis difficult for nonexperts, especially when the data under study consists of primarily of images/volumes.\nSystems that produce transformations and/or dense correspondences will typically produce high-dimensional shape descriptors, whereas many users prefer lower-dimensional descriptors to perform subsequent statistical analyses such as clustering, regression, or hypothesis testing. Therefore, there is typically an additional set of processes (e.g. PCA in various forms) that require further expertise (and research) to interpret these complex, high-dimensional outputs and distill them down to usable quantities. These challenges point a need for an end-to-end system that takes in images and automatically extracts its shape landmarks, for direct statistical shape analysis.",
        "Business processes represent transactions internal to or between companies, which take place over a certain amount of time. Business processes do not necessary have to be supported or be executed by a business process management (BPM) system. If they do, however, they have the benefit of coordination, which greatly reduces the effort of the process owner to keep track of unclaimed tasks, sequence, logging and so forth.\nAt the time of execution, business processes are commonly instantiated by the BPM system with all relevant parameters to distribute tasks correctly. The Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) (1999) defines these parameters, workflow relevant data, as \"data that is used by a Workflow Management System to determine the state transitions of a workflow instance, for example within pre-and post-conditions, transition conditions or workflow participant assignment.\" However, long running processes may require that these parameters, the process's context, are updated or extended during execution and that the flow of the process can be adapted. For example, fluctuations in exchange rates, change of weather patterns, or traffic congestions can have an impact on logistics processes and change their profitability or lead to failed instances (e.g., late deliveries). However, not all parameters may be known at initialization. While WfMC's definition does not explicitly exclude this understanding, its aim is to define data internal to the BPM system (Workflow Management Coalition, 1999) .\nConsider for example a logistics process of the delivery of a spare part for mining machine. Once the need for a spare part has been signaled, the machine provider may have only a certain timeframe to replace the part due to the current service level agreement (SLA).",
        "Aside from time-lapse photography, motion blur is usually one of the most undesirable artifacts during photo shooting. Many works have been devoted to studying how to recover sharp details from the blur, and great progress has been made. Recently, starting from Jin et al. [10] , the community has focused on the more challenging task of recovering high-frame-rate sharp videos from blurred images, which can be collectively termed joint deblurring and interpolation [39, 40] or blur temporal super-resolution [28, [35] [36] [37] . This joint task can serve various applications, such as video visual perception enhancement, slow motion generation [28] , and fast moving object analysis [35] [36] [37] . For brevity, we will refer to this task as blur interpolation.\nRecent works [7, 9, 39] demonstrate that the joint approach outperforms schemes that cascade separate deblur-ring and video frame interpolation methods. Most joint approaches follow the center-frame interpolation pipeline, which means that they can only generate latent frames for middle moments in a recursive manner. DeMFI [28] breaks this constraint by combining self-induced featureflow-based warping and pixel-flow-based warping to synthesize latent sharp frame at arbitrary time t. However, even on synthetic data, the performance of current methods is still far from satisfactory for human perception. We find that the potential temporal correlation in blur has been underutilized, which allows huge space for performance improvement of the blur interpolation algorithm. In addition, blur interpolation suffers from the generalization issue because there is no real-world dataset to support model training.\nThe goal of this work is to resolve the above two issues. In light of the complex distribution of time-dependent reconstruction and temporal symmetry property, we propose dual-end temporal supervision (DTS) and temporally symmetric ensembling (TSE) strategies to enhance the shared temporal features of blur interpolation transformer (BiT) for time-varying motion reconstruction. In addition, a multiscale residual Swin transformer block (MS-RSTB) is introduced to empower the model with the ability to effectively handle the blur in different scales and to fuse information from adjacent frames. Due to our design, BiT achieves state-of-the-art on the public benchmark performance even without optical flow-based warping operations. Meanwhile, to provide a real-world benchmark to the community, we further design an accurate hybrid camera system following [34, 55] to capture a dataset (RBI) containing timealigned low-frame-rate blurred and high-frame-rate sharp video pairs.",
        "With the increasing use of the internet and social media, the digital availability of various languages is rapidly expanding. This expansion opens avenues for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Machine Translation (MT). Nevertheless, despite African languages comprising 30% of around 6,000 living languages (Skutnabb-Kangas et al., 2003) , most of them are not supported by modern language technologies, leading to an ever-widening gap in language technology access (Joshi et al., 2020; Blasi et al., 2022) .\nRecently, SA has gained increasing attention, with its applications in various domains, such as public health, literature, and social sciences (Mohammad, 2022) . Despite the growth in this area, most previous works do not include African languages. This shared task focuses on SA on a Twitter dataset in 14 African languages, including Hausa (ha), Yoruba (yo), Igbo (ig), Nigerian Pidgin (pcm), Amharic (am), Tigrinya (tg), Oromo (or), Swahili (sw), Xitsonga (ts), Algerian Arabic (dz), Kinyarwanda (kr), Twi (twi), Mozambican Portuguese (pt), and Moroccan Darija (ma). This paper presents a novel SA system that effectively addresses the challenge of low-resource and multilingual sentiment classification for multiple African languages.

        "R EMOTE sensing image (RSI) analysis and interpretation hold paramount significance in the domain of computer vision, encompassing a range of distinct tasks such as landcover classification [1] , [2] , change detection [3] , [4] , [5] , object detection [6] , [7] , [8] , etc. Such analysis facilitates the monitoring of natural phenomena and human activities on Earth's surface, encompassing domains like land-use surveillance [9] , disaster prevention [10] , precision agriculture [11] , and wildfire detection [12] . By capturing both natural occurrences and human-induced activities, RSI plays an indispensable role in applications spanning geographic information systems, agriculture, environmental science, and myriad other fields.\nIn the past decades, with the surge in aerospace technology, earth observation satellites generate terabytes of RSIs daily [13] . Despite this abundance, two primary challenges persist:\n(1) High Specialist Manpower Requirement: The identification and labelling of RSIs necessarily demand professional researchers, resulting in high costs. (2) The Presence of Noisy Labels: The intrinsic complexity of RSIs makes generating flawless labels during large-scale data annotation challenging. This abundance of large but noisy labels is harmful for many tasks [14] . Addressing these issues, the remote sensing community has shifted focus to automatic feature extraction and analysis from unlabeled RSIs [15] , [16] , [17] . Selfsupervised learning (SSL), exploiting the intrinsic structure of data, emerges as a key method to harness the potential of large-scale unlabeled RSIs.\nEarly SSL methods largely relied on various pretext tasks [18] , such as jigsaw puzzles [19] , patch localization [20] , and image inpainting [21] . These methods exhibit limited generalizability and are far surpassed by contrastive learning (CL). CL enhances representation by drawing similar instances closer and distancing dissimilar ones [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] . It captures feature representations with high discriminability and strong generalizability, standing out among various SSL methods.\nHowever, efficiently applying CL in remote sensing is hindered by two main obstacles. First, as delineated by the fundamental laws of geography [29] , data samples with close geographical proximity should inherently exhibit a degree of similarity. As depicted in Fig. 1 , images from the same scene demonstrate significant semantic and perceptual similarities. However, the current CL paradigm tends to classify geographically and semantically similar samples as negatives, overlooking their potential mutual connections and resulting in sample confusion [30] . Second, RSIs often lack clear foregroundbackground distinctions, with key information randomly distributed throughout the entire image. However, CL, as a global discriminant task, excels in extracting global discriminative information and inherently struggles to capture details.",
        "Decimal arithmetic is widely used in financial and scientific applications. Thus, IEEE 754 (Standard for floating-point arithmetic) has been revised to include decimal floating-point formats and operations [1] . Many software (SW) languages support decimal arithmetic that is realized with binary hardware units. However, these may not be satisfactory for a very large application in terms of performance. Many financial applications need to keep the quality of their customer service concurrently with the back-end computing process where computing time is a matter for the business owner.\nThe decimal arithmetic can be computed with software (arithmetic with binary hardware units) [2] - [4] , hardware (dedicated hardware unit for decimal floating-point arithmetic) [5] - [8] , or combination of both [9] . Software solutions are flexible and no additional hardware cost is involved. Hardware solutions require high-performance dedicated decimal units with high hardware cost. Software-hardware codesign solutions can co-optimize flexibility, performance and hardware cost and give several Pareto points to development of embedded systems. In software-hardware co-design solutions, a part of solution requires some dedicated hardware while other part can be executed in standard processors supporting binary arithmetics. However, evaluation of co-design solutions requires special evaluation environments.\nIn [9] , four software-hardware co-design methods for decimal multiplication are proposed. part. A software part is evaluated by running it in several software platforms by replacing hardware part with dummy functions, while a hardware part is evaluated by designing hardware with computeraided-design tools. The environment can roughly evaluate the total performance as an execution time of software program with dummy functions.\nTo obtain more accurate evaluation, integrated environment with dedicated hardware design, software platform, and the interface between them is required. An open-source processor like UltraSparc T2 architecture [10] from Oracle/Sun (the first 64-bit microprocessors open-sourced) with standard SPARC instruction set architecture [11] can be used for such evaluation. However, it requires not only adding new decimal floating-point units and new instructions for them but also software tools to generate and simulate binary codes for the new architecture. SPARC V9 architecture provides IMPDEP1, 2 (Implementation-Dependent Instruction 1,2) and they can be used for new custom instructions.\nIn this work, we develop an evaluation framework for software-hardware co-design of decimal computation using RISC-V ecosystem [12] . RISC-V ecosystem is an opensource environment including RISC-V ISA, Rocket chip (one hardware implementation for RISC-V), RoCC (Rocket custom co-processor, Rocket chip interface to support accelerators), several languages for software and hardware, and several tools for verification and evaluation. In the proposed framework, a co-design solution is realized as a software that accepts new decimal-oriented instructions, and the new instructions are supported by a dedicated accelerator. Cycle-accurate analysis is given by emulating RISC-V binary on Rocket chip with the dedicated accelerator.",
        "Accurate estimation of object pose (translation and rotation) is crucial for autonomous robots to grasp and manipulate objects in an unstructured environment. Even small inaccuracies in the belief of the object pose can generate incorrect grasp configurations and lead to failures in manipulation tasks [1] . Strategies based on vision sensors are commonly used for estimating the pose of the object, but there is residual uncertainty in the estimated pose due to incorrect calibration of the sensors, environmental conditions (occlusions, presence of extreme light, and low visibility conditions), and object properties (transparent, specular, reflective). Tactile sensors in combination with robot proprioception provides high fidelity local measurements regarding object pose. However, mapping entire objects using tactile sensors is highly inefficient and time-consuming which necessitates the use of active data collection for object pose estimation. Furthermore, due to extremely low sparsity of the tactile data, novel techniques are required for performing pose estimation.\nTypical batch registration methods for pose estimation such as ICP or its variants [2] have low performance when sparse data is available that arrive sequentially as is the case with tactile measurements [3] . Hence filter-based approaches are generally preferred for sequential data [4] , [5] . Tactile measurements are inherently sparsely distributed and a probabilistic method was proposed in [4] to perform registration given sparse point cloud, surface normal measurements and the geometric model of the object. While tactile data can be collected in a randomised manner or driven by a human-teleoperator, active touch strategies which allows for autonomous data collection and reduction of redundant data collection are required [6] . Several works have used information gain metric based on the uncertainty of the object's pose to determine the next best touching action to localise the object [7] . While in literature, the next best action selection is based on expected information gain via metrics such as Shannon entropy [6] , Kullback-Leibler divergence [8] , mutual information [7] and so on, a number of other related information theoretic metrics remain to be explored in the robotic domain.\nContribution: In this article, we empirically evaluate various information theoretic criteria for selection the next best action in the context of tactile-based localisation. We use our novel probabilistic translation-invariant Quaternion filter (TIQF) for pose estimation [9] .",
        "Text-to-speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech for any given text [1] . TTS is an important research direction in artificial intelligence (AI) and received wide attention from academia and industry [2] . It has a wide range of applications, such as navigation, announcement, smart assistants, and other speech-enabled devices. With the development of deep learning technology, high-quality training data has become a necessary condition for training a reliable neural network model. Therefore, to build a robust TTS system, a high-quality speech dataset is required. For the mainstream languages such as Chinese and English, there are a lot of large-scale high-quality speech data, such as LJSpeech [3] , libriTTS [4] , AiShell [5] , etc. However, for some low-resource languages such as Mongolian, such data is scarce. In order to address this, we developed a open-source speech dataset for the Mongolian language. We named our dataset MnTTS, and it is primarily geared to build high-quality Mongolian TTS systems.\nMongolian language belongs to the Mongolian branch of the Mongolian language family of the Altai language family, which is the most famous and widely spoken language of the Mongolian language family. Mongolian is mainly used in Mongolian-inhabited areas of China, Mongolia and the Siberian Federal District of the Russian Federation. At the same time, Mongolian is also the main national language in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. In the world, the number of speakers is about 6 million [6] . Furthermore, there is a growing awareness of the importance of increasing the number of Mongolian speakers reflected in many language rescue initiatives2 launched by the government. Therefore, the study of speech synthesis technology for Mongolian is of great significance for education, transportation, communication and other fields in ethnic minority areas. Note that the Mongolian language used in Mongolia country is mainly spelled in Cyrillic scripts [7] because of the influence of the former Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s, while used in China is mainly spelled in traditional scripts [8] . This paper focus on the traditional scripts.\nCurrently, there is no Mongolian speech dataset of sufficient quality for building TTS systems, especially recently proposed end-to-end (E2E) neural architectures [9] - [16] , such as Tacotron [9] , Tacotron2 [13] models. Armed with WaveNetlike vocoders, the effect of synthetic speech has reached the level of human pronunciation. To further speed up the inference process, non-autoregressive TTS models and vocoders, like FastSpeech [14] , FastSpeech2 [15] , MelGAN [17] , Voc-GAN [18] , HiFi-GAN [19] etc., are proposed and achieved excellent performance. This work aims to fill the gap for Mongolian by introducing the MnTTS dataset.",

Jagabandhu Mishra (jagabandhu.mishra.18@iitdh.ac.in) and S.R.M. Prasanna (prasanna@iitdh.ac.in) are from the Department of Electrical Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dharwad, India. systems. The implicit systems model the language information directly from the speech signal. On the other hand, the explicit systems model the language information through intermediate modeling of phonemes, Senones and tokens, etc. Both approaches have their own pros and cons. The intermediate modeling of the explicit approach requires transcribed speech data and also complicates the system design [3] . In contrast, the use of an implicit approach poses a challenge for the modeling of language-specific long-term dynamics directly from speech signals [5] - [7] . However, the recently evolved deep learning frameworks like the recurrent neural network (RNN), time-delay neural network (TDNN), and transformer, etc. are able to show their success in the modeling of longterm dynamics [8] - [11] . Further, the perception study shown in [2] , shows humans can able to recognize the language, without knowing the grammatical details of the language. Therefore motivates this work to explore implicit approaches for performing LD tasks. Specific to LD, mostly the CS utterances are spoken by a single speaker [5] , [10] . In such a scenario, the phoneme production of secondary language may be biased toward the primary language and make language discrimination challenging at the acoustic-phonetic level. Fig. 1 (a) and (b) shows the time domain and spectrogram representation of a CS utterance (Hindi-English). From both the time domain and spectrogram representation it is difficult to discriminate between the languages. Further, Fig. 1(c), (d) , and (e) shows the languagespecific distribution of the two-dimensional t-SNE projection of 39 dimensional voiced Mel frequency cepstral coefficients along with their velocity and acceleration (MFCC+\u2206 + \u2206\u2206), posterior vectors extracted from wav2vec (W2V) finetuned Hindi and English model, and the TDNN based x-vector representations, respectively. The MFCC+\u2206 + \u2206\u2206 features are extracted from speech signal by considering 20 msec and 10 msec as framesize and frameshift, respectively. The grapheme posterior vectors are extracted from the available trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) English (32 dimension) and Hindi (67 dimension) and models at [12] and then concatenated to form 99 dimension vectors with framesize and frameshift of 25 and 20 msec, respectively. The x-vectors are extracted from the implicitly trained x-vector framework by considering framesize and frameshift as 2000 and 10 msec, respectively. The figure shows that the overlap between the languages is more in the MFCC feature space. This is due to the similarity in the phoneme production of both primary and secondary language, as the secondary language phonemes are mostly produced by adapting the phoneme production system of the primary language. The overlap between the languages reduced significantly in the language-specific posterior and x-vector space. Here the language-specific posterior and xvector represent the explicit and implicit system, respectively. Comparing Fig. 1(d ) and (e), it can be observed that the language discrimination using the implicit approach is at par with the explicit approach. This observation justifies the feasibility of the development of the implicit LD system.\nIn literature there exist few attempts to perform LD and related tasks. The related tasks refer to CS point detection (CSD), CS utterance detection (CSUD), sub-utterance level language identification (SLID), etc.",

        "A family C of subsets of a finite set X is a convexity on X if \u2205, X \u2208 C and C is closed under intersection (van de Vel (1993) ). Given a graph G and a family P of paths of G, the P-interval of a set S \u2286 V (G) is formed by S and all vertices of every path of P between vertices of S. The set S is P-convex if S is equal to its P-interval. The P-convex hull of S is the minimum P-convex set containing S. It is easy to see that the P-convex sets form a convexity on V (G). Indeed, the most studied graph convexities are defined in this way. For instance, the well-known geodetic convexity has P as the family of shortest paths (Pelayo (2013); Dourado et al. (2016) ), the P 3 convexity has P as the family of paths of order 3 (Campos et al. (2015) ; Centeno et al. (2011)) , and in the monophonic convexity, P is the family of all induced paths (Dourado et al. (2010) ; Duchet (1988) ).\nThe set S is said to be P-convexly independent if for every u \u2208 S, it holds that u does not belong to the P-convex hull of S -{u}.",
        "Machine learning (ML) systems are being developed and used for a broad range of tasks, from predicting medical diagnoses [29] to informing hiring decisions [3] . Many are intended to be part of a larger sociotechnical process involving human decision-makers. In these cases, in-domain accuracy is not enough to guarantee good outcomesthe people using a particular system must also understand the model's reliability (i.e., when its predictions should be trusted, in general and on a case-by-case basis) and modulate their trust appropriately [27, 57] . Model interpretability, which is broadly intended to give insight into how a particular ML model works, can play an important role here.\nMany existing approaches to model interpretability, however, require a non-trivial amount of ML expertise to understand, and thus are often only used in practice by ML developers [6] . While tools for developers are certainly needed, the people who will actually deal with model predictions during decision-making are often a distinctly different set of users. Even methods that are intended to be simpler and more understandable to such users, such as reporting feature weights or displaying more information about the model and dataset, have not improved decision-making in experimental studies [9, 28, 36, 52, 61] .\nHere, we introduce two visual analytics modules to facilitate more intuitive assessment of model reliability. First, we use k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to ground the model's output in examples familiar to the user [53] . Alongside the overall distribution of neighbors, a unit visualization depicts individual example, encoding their class and similarity to the original input according to the model. An interactive overlaid display provides a more raw visualization of the examples for more detailed comparison. Second, we introduce an interactive editor for probing the model. Users can apply transformations corresponding to semantically-meaningful perturbations of the data, and see how the model's output changes in response. Using these modules together, users can iteratively build their intuition about the model's strengths and limitations. By interactively examining individual neighbors, they can investigate questions like whether variation amongst the neighboring examples is expected for the domain, or if it indicates unreliability; whether the commonalities amongst neighbors align with domain knowledge; or whether these neighbors reveal limitations or biases in the data. Similarly, by interactively modifying the model's input, users can pose and test hypotheses about the model's reasoning, checking that its behavior aligns with domain expectations -for example, ensuring that the model is not overly sensitive to small input modifications that should be class-preserving.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of our interface modules through a medical case study of classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeats with different types of irregularities.",
        "Time series forecasting has remained an important area of research as it directly deals with problems such as demand prediction (Lu et al., 2021) , resource optimization (Xiang et al., 2021) , traffic flow predictions (Zheng et al., 2021) , predictive maintenance (Arena et al., 2022) , etc which are critical for businesses, governments, and industries. Having an accurate estimate of future trends can help mitigate losses, increase financial profits, and can allow for effective planning and resource utilization. As a result, it is not surprising that a great deal of emphasis has been laid on time series forecasting problems and improvements to forecasting methods are highly desirable.\nRecently, purely data driven Machine Learning(ML) methods like Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained huge success. DNNs are quite proficient in extracting useful features from the data and have achieved amazing performance in various domains that include time series forecasting problems (Cai et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2017) , image segmentation and classification (Yuan et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2021) , natural language processing (Du et al., 2021) , etc. However, more often than not these networks are huge, containing millions of trainable parameters whose optimization requires an equally large training dataset which in many real-world applications are not available. Arguably, dependency on a large amount of accurately labeled data is one of the biggest limitations of DNNs. Dependency on large datasets puts DNNs in quite a predicament for time series modeling problems since a long time series in temporal domain may still have very few data points for DNN to train upon. For example, a monthly time series spanning over 20 years will only have 240 historical observations for training. Consequently, complex deep networks are prone to overfitting on temporal forecasting problems and in many real-world forecasting problems their superiority, if at all, is not as profound as in other domains (Makridakis & Hibon, 2000; Makridakis et al., 2018) .\nOn the other hand, Knowledge Driven Systems(KDS) aim to rely on human knowledge to come up with predictions. They do not normally rely on historical data. KDS typically comprises of a knowledge base that consists of problemspecific facts and manually defined rules. These rules are specifically tailored towards capturing the knowledge of human experts and are followed in a predefined manner for inference in an attempt to mimic the decision making process of the experts. KDS systems are still widely used especially in risk critical domains such as health (Zhang et al., 2019; Fernandes et al., 2018) , collision avoidance sys-tems (Hagen et al., 2018) , etc. For time series forecasting, KDS can have knowledge in the form of If-Then conditioning statements or arithmetic functions drawn from the statistical corpus. Although these systems do not directly or marginally rely on data, however, formulating rules that generalize for every scenario is an arduous task. Needless to say, both knowledge and data driven domains have their distinct advantages that are complementary in nature. DNNs are dexterous in processing and extracting useful features from the data while KDS can model the underlying process very well which enables them to work well in data scarce scenarios. Hence relying on one domain to come up with a solution can be sub-optimal.\nA natural step forward is to combine DNNs and KDS. Hybrid schemes that combine additional information with DNNs are becoming increasingly common. However, most of these hybrid schemes for time series forecasting rely on ensemble methods, where separate systems are combined post predictions by using weighted ensemble (Kaushik et al., 2020; Choi & Lee, 2018; Smyl, 2020) , or by using statistical methods for preprocessing and feature extraction which are then given as inputs to DNNs (Tripathy & Acharya, 2018; Smyl, 2020) . Although these frameworks combine different domains, they are restricted by the information present in the data. Cases where data is limited severely hamper their performance. Moreover, we believe that in an ideal fusion scheme one domain should be aware of the weaknesses of the other and should try to supplement the missing information.",
        "Knowledge distillation (KD) [Bucilu\u01ce et al., 2006 , Hinton et al., 2015] is a popular method of compressing a large \"teacher\" model into a more compact \"student\" model. In its most basic form, this involves training the student to fit the teacher's predicted label distribution or soft labels for each sample. There is strong empirical evidence that distilled students usually perform better than students trained on raw dataset labels [Hinton et al., 2015 , Furlanello et al., 2018 , Stanton et al., 2021 , Gou et al., 2021] . Multiple works have devised novel KD procedures that further improve the student model performance (see Gou et al. [2021] and references therein). Simultaneously, several works have aimed to rigorously formalize why KD can improve the student model performance. Some prominent observations from this line of work are that (self-)distillation induces certain favorable optimization biases in the training objective [Phuong and Lampert, 2019, Ji and Zhu, 2020] , lowers variance of the objective [Menon et al., 2021 , Dao et al., 2021 , Ren et al., 2022] , increases regularization towards learning \"simpler\" functions [Mobahi et al., 2020] , transfers information from different data views [Allen-Zhu and Li, 2020] , and scales per-example gradients based on the teacher's confidence [Furlanello et al., 2018 , Tang et al., 2020] .\nDespite this remarkable progress, there are still many open problems and unexplained phenomena around knowledge distillation; to name a few:\n-Why do soft labels (sometimes) help? It is agreed that teacher's soft predictions carry information about class similarities [Hinton et al., 2015 , Furlanello et al., 2018] , and that this softness of predictions has a regularization effect similar to label smoothing [Yuan et al., 2020] . Nevertheless, KD also works in binary classification settings with limited class similarity information [M\u00fcller et al., 2020] . How exactly the softness of teacher predictions (controlled by a temperature parameter) affects the student learning remains far from well understood.\n-The role of capacity gap. There is evidence that when there is a significant capacity gap between the teacher and the student, the distilled model usually falls behind its teacher [Mirzadeh et al., 2020 , Cho and Hariharan, 2019 , Stanton et al., 2021] . It is unclear whether this is due to difficulties in optimization, or due to insufficient student capacity.\n-What makes a good teacher? Sometimes less accurate models are better teachers [Cho and Hariharan, 2019, Mirzadeh et al., 2020] . Moreover, early stopped or exponentially averaged models are often better teachers [Ren et al., 2022] . A comprehensive explanation of this remains elusive.\nThe aforementioned wide range of phenomena suggest that there is a complex interplay between teacher accuracy, softness of teacher-provided targets, and complexity of the distillation objective.\nThis paper provides a new theoretically grounded perspective on KD through the lens of supervision complexity. In a nutshell, this quantifies why certain targets (e.g., temperature-scaled teacher probabilities) may be \"easier\" for a student model to learn compared to others (e.g., raw one-hot labels), owing to better alignment with the student's neural tangent kernel (NTK) [Jacot et al., 2018 , Lee et al., 2019] . In particular, we provide a novel theoretical analysis ( \u00a72, Thm. 3 and 4) of the role of supervision complexity on kernel classifier generalization, and use this to derive a new generalization bound for distillation (Prop. 5). The latter highlights how student generalization is controlled by a balance of the teacher generalization, the student's margin with respect to the teacher predictions, and the complexity of the teacher's predictions.\nBased on the preceding analysis, we establish the conceptual and practical efficacy of a simple online distillation approach ( \u00a74), wherein the student is fit to progressively more complex targets, in the form of teacher predictions at various checkpoints during its training. This method can be seen as guiding the student in the function space (see Fig. 1 ), and leads to better generalization compared to offline distillation. We provide empirical results on a range of image classification benchmarks confirming the value of online distillation, particularly for students with weak inductive biases.\nBeyond practical benefits, the supervision complexity view yields new insights into distillation:\n-The role of temperature scaling and early-stopping. Temperature scaling and early-stopping of the teacher have proven effective for KD. We show that both of these techniques reduce the supervision complexity, at the expense of also lowering the classification margin. Online distillation manages to smoothly increase teacher complexity, without degrading the margin.\n-Teaching a weak student. We show that for students with weak inductive biases, and/or with much less capacity than the teacher, the final teacher predictions are often as complex as dataset labels, particularly during the early stages of training. In contrast, online distillation allows the supervision complexity to progressively increase, thus allowing even a weak student to learn.\n-NTK and relational transfer. We show that online distillation is highly effective at matching the teacher and student NTK matrices. This transfers relational knowledge in the form of example-pair similarity, as opposed to standard distillation which only transfers per-example knowledge.\nProblem setting. We focus on classification problems from input domain X to d classes. We are given a training set of n labeled examples {(x 1 , y 1 ), . . . , (x n , y n )}, with one-hot encoded labels y i \u2208 {0, 1} d . Typically, a model f \u03b8 : X \u2192 R d is trained with the softmax cross-entropy loss:\nEQUATION\nwhere \u03c3(\u2022) is the softmax function.",
        "Artificial intelligence (AI) is progressively becoming an integral part of our daily lives, emphasizing the need for transparent (Saxon et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2023) and responsible (Bergman and Diab, 2022 ) AI systems. An essential element in achieving transparency and building trust between such systems and users is the generation of natural language explanations (NLE) (Kumar and Talukdar, 2020) . The NLEs play a crucial role in clarifying the reasoning behind AI decisions. As the significance of NLEs continues to grow, it has become increasingly important to evaluate the quality of these explanations (Yao et al., 2023a) .\nTraditionally, evaluating NLEs has largely relied on gathering human judgments (Clinciu et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2023a) . Assessing text quality through human evaluation is a crucial yet intricate endeavor (van der Lee et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2023a) . This complexity arises from two key factors: the inherently subjective nature of human text quality assessments (Yao et al., 2023a) and fine-grained ratings on a Likert scale (van der Lee et al., 2019) . Furthermore, it is challenging to eliminate unintended biases in question wording (Schoch et al., 2020) or participant recruitment (Kwak et al., 2022) in collecting human responses. Consequently, human evaluation can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Developing models capable of autonomously assessing explanation quality could be a valuable complement to human evaluations, which is a critical step toward responsible AI systems (Chiang and Lee, 2023) .\nThe emergence of the new generation of large language models (LLMs), such as Instruct-GPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and ChatGPT (Ope-nAI, 2022) , has demonstrated remarkable ability in understanding natural language. These models have leveraged extensive knowledge accrued during training to outperform prior approaches in various tasks, including open-domain QA, document summarization, and mathematical reasoning (Qin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b; Bang et al., 2023) . ChatGPT has also exhibited human-level competency in generating informative and clear NLEs, especially in contexts like hate speech detection (Huang et al., 2023b) . This progress naturally leads to whether LLMs can evaluate the quality of explanations. As AI-driven systems play pivotal roles in applications where explaining their decisions is imperative, ensuring the accuracy and alignment of LLM's assessments with human judgments becomes increasingly essential. While numerous studies have investigated the potential of LLMs to replace or augment human annotations, the primary focus has been on classification tasks such as topic and stance detection (Yi Liaw et al., 2023; Gilardi et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023b) , with little attention given to their ability to assign ratings or distinguish among ordinal categories, a focus of our study.\nIn this study, we delve into the alignment between ChatGPT's evaluation of explanation quality and human assessments using three distinct datasets: e-SNLI for logical reasoning (Camburu et al., 2018) , LIAR-PLUS for misinformation justification (Alhindi et al., 2018) , and Latent Hatred for implicit hate speech explanation (ElSherief et al., 2021) .",
        "Discerning the relationships between somatic mutations in cancers is the foundation for targeted treatment and patient subtyping. Since somatic mutations in cancer genomes are often heterogeneous and sparse, where two patients with the same cancer may share only one mutation among thousands, models summarize the high-dimensional interactions into a simpler form. This requires a model that incorporates multiple confounding variables to determine relationships between somatic mutations. Based on current literature [1] , [2] mutually exclusive and co-occurring mutations are influenced by nonlinear relationships between gene mutation frequencies, biological processes, cancer (sub)types, total number of mutations in a tumor (TML), and positive selection for mutations. The combination of multiple confounding variables and the inherent sparsity of somatic mutation data poses a challenge to understand the underlying co-dependencies between mutations.\nStatistical and computational models that try to discover relationships between somatic mutations often decompose a patient's mutation profile into a set of higher-level structures that closely resemble known biological processes. This approach [3] , [4] generally follows a random walk on an existing biological interaction network. This networks can be modeled as a graph, G = (V, E), where each vertex, V is a gene, and the edge, E denotes the interaction among genes. The network is then modified into a weighted graph, with edge weights representing probability of interactions and vertex weights corresponding to the frequency of a mutation in a gene. A walk is then simulated by starting at a mutated gene and moving to another gene based on the probabilities of edge and vertex weights. The end result is a smaller subnetwork called a functional network that represents an altered biological process. While functional networks have been validated to discover some aberrant genes and pathways, they often result in false positives due to the inherent assumptions made.\nThe most common compendium of interaction networks widely used to generate functional networks is the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [5] . The KEGG interaction networks specify genetic pathways, which are complex graphical networks with directed and undirected edges connecting genes based on their physical and biochemical properties. The genetic pathways are then ascribed to specific biological processes. For example, the biological process of cell apoptosis (cell death) is controlled by two known genetic pathways compromising of a multitude of different genes. The networks within the KEGG database, however, are diverse and recapitulate a disease free patient. Functional networks therefore, assume the interaction networks are also cancerrelevant and disease-specific. As a result, functional networks are generalized to a common patient population and struggle to discriminate between different cancer types [6] .\nThe second assumption is how functional networks take advantage of mutual exclusivity in somatic mutations. The process of mutual exclusivity in somatic mutations describes how mutations do not occur together if they are in the same genetic pathway [7] . In functional networks, accounting for mutual exclusivity corresponds to the frequency of a mutation, which is the weight of a vertex V i in the graph. Theory, however suggests that there are multiple confounding factors that cause mutual exclusivity [1] .",
        "The large number of trainable parameters in deep neural networks imposes computational constraints on the information that can be made available to optimization algorithms. Standard machine learning libraries (Abadi et al., 2015; Paszke et al., 2019) mainly provide access to first-order information in the form of average mini-batch gradients. This is a limitation that complicates the development of novel methods that may outperform the state-of-the-art: They must use the same objects to remain easy to implement and use, and to rely on the highly optimized code of those libraries. There is evidence that this has led to stagnation in the performance of first-order optimizers (Schmidt et al., 2021) . Here, we thus study how to provide efficient access to richer information, namely higher-order derivatives and their distribution across the mini-batch.\nRecent advances in automatic differentiation (Bradbury et al., 2020; Dangel et al., 2020) have made such information more readily accessible through vectorization of algebraic structure in the differentiated loss. We leverage and extend this functionality to efficiently access curvature in form of the Hessian's generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) approximation. It offers practical advantages over the Hessian and is established for training (Martens, 2010; Martens & Grosse, 2015) , compressing (Singh & Alistarh, 2020) , or adding uncertainty to (Ritter et al., 2018b; a; Kristiadi et al., 2020) neural networks. It is also linked theoretically to the natural gradient method (Amari, 2000) via the Fisher information matrix (Martens, 2020, Section 9.2) .\nTraditional ways to access curvature fall into two categories. Firstly, repeated automatic differentiation allows for matrixfree exact multiplication with the Hessian (Pearlmutter, 1994) and GGN (Schraudolph, 2002) .",
        "Telemedicine is an emerging and booming treatment approach in the medical field because of its high efficiency, cost-effective strategy, and safety. Compared with traditional medical treatment, telemedicine improves treatment efficiency through timely feedback between doctors and patients. Also, it leverages technologies, such as computer-aided pose assessment, to provide accurate and objective patient conditions, during which the time of supervision and evaluation by therapists is reduced, and the number of face-to-face diagnosis sessions is also lessened, thus significantly minimizing the cost of rehabilitation. Meanwhile, telemedicine offers new probabilities for patients with reduced mobility or disabilities to be treated at home, effectively preventing infection caused by exposure to unsanitary conditions. In practice, delivering such a service remotely requires satisfying several constraints like exploiting limited computing power on personal computers, high precision, and real-time performance. Fig. 1 . An attention cube is introduced to wrap the target from the main view, and evenly distributed gray points stand for attention points on each surface. ACRNet calculates the point-wise weight on each surface to find the informative attention points for regressing the 3D position of joints. In the figure, the darker the point's color, the higher its weight.\nTelemedicine has been widely used in three medical application areas: prediction of movement disorders, diagnosis of movement disorders, and sports rehabilitation training [1] - [3] . One of the most significant technology for realizing them is utilizing human pose estimation (HPE) to reconstruct the 3D human body skeleton. Considering the actual implementation requirements in telemedicine, scientists proposed sensor-based and learning-based methods to estimate human pose for 3D reconstruction. However, sensor-based methods (e.g., wearable equipment) need to be attached to the body of patients, which affects patient movement, leading to inaccurate diagnoses. Moreover, appropriately adjusting devices on wearable equipment, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and gyroscopes, requires professional skills. Therefore, the drawbacks of sensor-based methods seriously hinder its further development in telemedicine.\nBenefiting from advances in deep learning and computer vision, learning-based HPE technology enables telemedicine to get rid of counting on sensor-based methods in a noncontact and easily calibrated way. Nevertheless, these methods still face low accuracy and high latency problems. As a result, to meet the multiple requirements in telemedicine, we propose a novel Attention Cube Regression Network (ACR-Net), a unified and effective network with fully differentiable end-to-end training ability to perform estimation work based on multi-view depth images.",
        "Interval methods represent a long-standing and prominent approach to time series classification. Most interval methods are strikingly similar, closely following a paradigm established by Rodr\u00edguez et al (2000) and Geurts (2001) , and involve computing various descriptive statistics and other miscellaneous features over multiple subseries of an input time series, and/or some transformation of an input time series (e.g., the first difference or discrete Fourier transform), and using those features to train a classifier, typically an ensemble of decision trees (e.g., Deng et al, 2013; Lines et al, 2018) . This represents an appealingly simple approach to time series classification (see Middlehurst and Bagnall, 2022; Henderson et al, 2023) . We observe that it is possible to achieve the same accuracy, on average, as the most accurate existing interval methods simply by sorting the values in each interval and using the sorted values as features or, in order to reduce the size of the feature space (and, accordingly, computational cost), to subsample these sorted values, i.e., to use the quantiles of the values in the intervals as features. We name this approach Quant.\nThe difference in mean accuracy and the pairwise win/draw/loss between Quant and several other prominent interval methods, namely, TSF (Deng et al, 2013) , STSF (Cabello et al, 2020) , rSTSF (Cabello et al, 2021) , CIF (Middlehurst et al, 2020) , and DrCIF (Middlehurst et al, 2021b) , for a subset of 112 datasets from the UCR archive (for which published results are available for all methods), are shown in the Multiple Comparison Matrix (MCM) in Figure 1 (see Ismail-Fawaz et al, 2023) . Results for the other methods are taken from Middlehurst et al (2023) . As shown in Figure 1 , Quant achieves higher accuracy on more datasets, and higher mean accuracy, than existing interval methods. Total compute time for Quant is significantly less than that of even the fastest of these methods (see further below).\nWhen using quantiles (or sorted values) as features, as we increase or decrease interval length, we move between two extremes: (a) a single interval where the quantiles (or sorted values) represent the distribution of the values over the whole time series (distributional information without location information); and (b) intervals of length one, together consisting of all of the values in the time series in their original order (location information without distributional information): see Figure 2 .\nQuantiles represent a superset of many of the features used in existing interval methods (min, max, median, etc.) . Using quantiles allows us to trivially increase or decrease the number of features, by increasing or decreasing the number of quantiles per interval which, in turn, allows us to balance accuracy and computational cost. We find that quantiles can be used with fixed (nonrandom) intervals, without any explicit interval or feature selection process, and with an 'off the shelf' classifier, in particular, extremely randomised trees (Geurts et al, 2006) , following Cabello et al (2021) .\nThe key advantages of distilling interval methods down to these essential components are simplicity and computational efficiency. Quant represents one of the fastest methods for time series classification.",
        "Automatic segmentation and classification of medical images play an important role in diagnostics, growth prediction, and treatment of brain tumors. An early tumor brain diagnosis implies a faster response in treatment, which helps to improve patients' survival rate. Location and classification of brain tumors in large medical images databases, taken in routine clinical tasks by manual procedures, have a high cost both in effort and time. An automatic detection, location, and classification procedure is desirable and worthwhile [1] .\nThere are several medical imaging techniques used to acquire information about tumors (tumor type, shape, size, location, etc.), which are needed for their diagnosis [2] . The most important techniques are Computed Tomography (CT), Single-Photon-Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). These techniques can be combined to obtain more detailed information about tumors. Anyhow, MRI is the most used technique due to its advantageous characteristics. In MRI acquisition, the scan provides hundreds of 2D image slices with high soft tissue contrast using no ionizing radiation [2] . There are four MRI modalities used in diagnosis: T1-weighted MRI (T1), T2-weighted MRI (T2), T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (T1-CE), and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). Each MRI modality produces images with different tissue contrasts; thus, some are more suited to search a specific kind of tissue than others. T1 modality is typically used to work with healthy tissues. T2 images are more appropriate to detect borders of edema regions. T1-CE images highlight tumor borders and FLAIR images favor the detection of edema regions in Cerebrospinal Fluid [3] . Provided that the goal of MRI image processing is to locate and classify brain tumors, T1-CE modality is adequate and, as it is shown in this paper, sufficient.\nIn the last decades, Brain Tumor Imaging (BTI) has grown at an exponential rate. More specifically, the number of works about brain tumor quantification based on MRI images has increased significantly [2] . Brain Tumor Segmentation (BTS) consists in differentiating tumor-infected tissues from healthy ones. In many BTS applications, the brain tumor image segmentation is achieved by classifying pixels, thus the segmentation problem turns into a classification [4] .\nThe aim of the work presented in this paper is to develop and test a Deep Learning approach for brain tumor classification and segmentation using a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network. To train and test the proposed neural model, a T1-CE MRI image dataset from 233 patients, including meningiomas, gliomas, and pituitary tumors in the common views (sagittal, coronal, and axial), has been used [5] . Figure 1 shows examples of these three types of tumors. Additional information on the dataset is included in Section 2.2. Our model is able to segment and predict the pathological type of the three kinds of brain tumors, outperforming previous studies using the same dataset. In the BTS field, two main tumor segmentation approaches can be found: generative and discriminative. Generative approaches use explicit anatomical models to obtain the segmentation, while discriminative methods learn image features and their relations using gold standard expert segmentations [2] . Published studies following the discriminative approach have evolved from using classical Machine Learning [6] [7] [8] [9] to more recent Deep Learning techniques [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .\nIn works using classical Machine Learning techniques, the segmentation pipeline includes a preprocessing stage designed for feature extraction. For example, in Sachdeva et al.",
        "In the field of robot vision, the performance of object detectors, including SSD [20] , YOLO [22] , RetinaNet [19] , Faster R-CNN [23] , and Mask R-CNN [14] , has been improved dramatically since convolutional neural network (CNN) [15] , [16] , [18] , [25] have been adopted for feature extraction of images. These well-known object detectors detect the objects based on a single image. When object detection is performed on video data that contains a sequence of image frames, the traditional approach is to perform detection for each image frame and to associate objects across frames in the subsequent object tracking stage. However, this approach does not exploit the temporal information in the image sequence, thereby limiting the detection performance. In addition, video images often suffer from degraded image quality due to motion blur, camera defocusing, anomalous poses, and object occlusion. Since this gives inconsistent detection results over time, and consequently burdens the object trackers, the object detectors should be designed to exploit temporal information to achieve the robust performance.\nRecently, object detectors, referred to as video object detectors (VoD), have been proposed, which use multiple consecutive video frames for object detection. Thus far, various VoD methods have been proposed in the literature [2] , [3] , [6] , [12] , [27] - [29] . In [2] , [12] , [28] , [29] , CNN feature maps were fused to produce an enhanced representation of objects for object detection. In particular, the methods in [3] , [6] , [27] associated the object proposals found in each video frame and fused the associated features to enhance the quality of the object features. In [8] and [26] , the motion of objects and the variation of camera position and angle were exploited to extract the representation of the moving objects.\nIn this paper, we present a novel VoD algorithm, referred to as temporal feature aggregation and motion-aware VoD (TM-VoD), which can construct robust and reliable features on objects using image sequences of finite length. We aim to design a VoD algorithm that achieves the following two objectives of VoD. First, the VoD algorithm should aggregate common, yet diverse representations of objects over multiple video frames. Since the location and the quality of object features change in time, the aggregation strategy should be adapted to such temporal variations. Next, the VoD algorithm should exploit the temporal motion patterns of objects to find rich and discriminative representations. Since objects of different classes exhibit distinctive motion patterns, the respective motions provide useful contextual cues for identifying the objects better.\nThe proposed TM-VoD method detects objects based on M past images, N future images, and present image as illustrated with the setup N = M = 2 in Fig. 1 . First, the TM-VoD fuses the visual feature maps obtained by the CNN backbone networks. To maximize the effect of feature aggregation, TM-VoD aligns and weights the feature maps to be aggregated in two stages. In the first stage, the pixel-level gated feature aggregation performs a weighted aggregation of the CNN feature maps based on their relevance to the detection task at hand. In the second stage, the box proposals obtained by the region proposal network (RPN) are aligned by temporal box offset calibration (TBOC) and weighted according to the cosine similarity between the present and adjacent frame features.",
        "In order to create safe and efficient mobile robots, introspective and reliability-aware capabilities are required to assess and recover from perception failures. Many perception tasks, including localization [1] , scene understanding and sensor calibration [2] , rely on point cloud registration. However, registration may provide incorrect estimates due to local minima of the registration cost function [3] , uncompensated motion distortion [4] , noise or when the registration problem is geometrically under-constrained [5] , [6] . Consequently, it is essential to measure alignment quality and to reject or re-estimate alignment when quality is low. In the past, an extensive number of methods have been proposed to assess the alignment quality of point cloud pairs [7] - [17] . These metrics can typically be used to measure a relative alignment error in the process of registration, but provide limited information on whether the point clouds are correctly aligned once registration has been carried out [18] . Until today, few studies have targeted the measurement of alignment correctness after registration [18] , [19] and previous works report that alignment correctness classification based on AdaBoost and NDT score function decrease when applied to point clouds acquired from new environments [19] .\nIn this paper, we propose \"CorAl\" (Correctly Aligned?): A method to introspectively measure and detect misalignment between previously registered point cloud pairs. CorAl specifically aims to bridge the gap in classification performance when applied to new unseen environments.\nOur method is well grounded in information theory and gives an intuitive alignment correctness measure. CorAl measures the difference between the average differential entropy in the joint and separate point clouds. For well-aligned point clouds, the joint and the separate point clouds have similar entropy. In contrast, misaligned point clouds tend to \"blur\" the scene which can be measured as an increase in joint entropy as depicted in fig. 3 . By using the separate point clouds to estimate the entropy inherent in the scene, our proposed method can assess quality in a range of different environments. The contribution of this paper is an intuitive and simple measure of alignment correctness between point cloud pairs. We demonstrate how to use this quality measure to train a simple model that detects small alignment errors between point clouds, large errors are not considered in this paper.",
        "Legged robots have increasingly become capable of robust locomotion and navigating over unstructured terrain. A major advantage of legged locomotion is an ability to traverse terrain which contains obstacles, gaps or other challenges intractable to wheeled or tracked platforms. For many realworld applications of legged platforms, it is a requirement that such terrain can be navigated with a high degree of autonomy. Path planning for legged robots requires reasoning about the platform's capabilities and can be difficult to deploy when combined with practical limitations such as sensor noise. While there has been significant work towards this goal, finding a robust and operational solution to humanoid path planning remains an open problem.\nThis paper presents a navigation path planner designed to enable humanoid locomotion over rough terrain and is intended to be used as a heuristic for a lower-level footstep planner. We build on the approach of many existing planners and perform a sample-based graph search which includes a traversability cost model [1] [2] [3] . The main contribution of our formulation is setting up the planner to use these traversability costs in a way that reflects the bipedal gait. Additionally, we include checks to prevent cutting corners, maintain a safe distance from obstacles and find reliable routes for ascending and descending terrain. Our approach first performs an A* search over a 2.5D height map by sampling terrain in the vicinity of each node to measure traversability. This initial path is then optimized using gradient descent in order to smooth the path while further improving its quality. We select A* for a few reasons, the first being that our cost functions are sample-based and preclude the use of a closed-form solver. The second is for the practical reason that the A* planning process lends itself to logging and visualization more than randomized or probabilistic graph-search approaches. The planner is tested extensively using real sensor data on a variety of terrains containing stairs, stepping stones, ramps, cinder blocks and large obstacles (Fig. 1 ). We also share results from testing on a DRC Atlas robot by integrating with an existing balance controller and footstep planner.",
        "Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) have proven to be an efficient framework for solving various problems in machine learning [4] , [5] . NODEs were inspired by the observation that a traditional residual neural network can be viewed as a discretized solution to an ordinary differential equation (ODE), where each \"layer\" corresponds to a single time step in the discretization, and the \"depth\" corresponds to the length of integration time. NODEs begin with this implied ODE model but treat the solution to this ODE as the hidden state. In this framework, a forward pass through the network is computed by calling an ODE solver, and backpropagation works by integrating an appropriate adjoint equation backward in time. NODEs are a time and memoryefficient model for various regression and classification tasks [4] , [5] .\nIn this work, we develop a novel continuous-time neural network approach based on delay differential equations (DDEs). The mathematical structure of delay differential equations differs substantially from that of ODEs [6] . As a result, phenomena modeled by DDEs are often poorly represented by ODE models. There has been recent progress in developing Neural DDEs (NDDEs), the DDE counterpart of NODEs [2] , [18] , [19] . For example, [18] and [19] show that NDDEs can learn models from time series data which cannot be learned by standard NODEs. ajr295@cornell.edu x x \u03b4x 0 p(0) Fig. 1 . Relation of adjoint to the variational equation. The black curve is the reference trajectory; red curve is a nearby perturbed trajectory. Orange represents the variation between the red curve and black curve. The blue arrows are the adjoint. Notice that the angle between the adjoint and the variation is constant.\nThey also show that NDDEs can perform classification tasks that standard NODEs cannot.\nOur work extends [2] , [18] and [19] in several ways. The authors of [18] assume the magnitude delay is known a priori, and their model cannot learn the delay as a parameter. By contrast, by performing a sensitivity analysis of our NDDE model, we derive an adjoint equation that allows our model to learn the delay from data. This difference makes our approach more applicable as a system identification tool, as the exact value of the delay is often unknown in practice.\nThere are myriad examples of dynamic processes whose evolution depends not only on the system's current state but also on the state at a previous time; such systems can be modeled by delay differential equations. Examples of such systems are wide-ranging: in computer networks, delays arise due to the transmission time of information packets [17] ; in gene expression dynamics, a delay occurs due to the time taken for the messenger RNA to copy genetic code and transport macromolecules from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [3] ; in population dynamics, delay enters due to the time taken for a species to reach reproductive maturity [11] .",
        "Recent advances in image generation have seen transformative developments, particularly with the emergence of text-to-image diffusion models trained on large datasets. Among these, Stable Diffusion, an open-source model referenced as [43] , stands out for democratizing image generation from textual prompts for a wide user base. Such progress significantly impacts various application domains, notably within the fashion industry, which commands a considerable market presence.\nIn the realm of fashion, virtual try-on is a classic task that aims to superimpose given garments onto specific user images [13, 20, 29, 41, 56, 62, 62] . The development of diffusion models offers new levels of photorealism in generated images that were previously unattainable with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. Diffusion-based models not only achieve levels of realism previously deemed unattainable, but also excel in restoring intricate details and ensuring the images retain a natural appearance.\nHowever, when extended beyond conventional virtual try-on tasks, existing methods face notable limitations. Garment merchants are in pursuit of creating varied product visuals, such as posters and display images, more cost-effectively. There is a dual demand: the ability for quick adjustments to models, poses, atmospheres, and backgrounds through textual prompts or reference conditions and the necessity for accurate depiction of textures and fabric dynamics. Stable diffusion's adaptability for swift modifications presents a promising avenue. Recent advances utilizing stable diffusion models in virtual try-on [29] signal the potential for generating garment images via stable diffusion. However, prior works have not fully exploited its capabilities in text-to-image and stylized image creation and have failed to preserve the complete patterns, e.g., stripes and texts.\nTherefore, merging the detailed representation of target garments with the adaptable nature of stable diffusion promises to benefit a broader spectrum of users, including merchants, consumers, and artists, by reducing the costs related to garment-related creativity and boosting commercial effectiveness. The question arises: How can we generate images from text prompts or control conditions while preserving the intricate details of specified garments? We address this question by introducing the concept of Garment-Centric (GC) Generation, which focuses on maintaining the fidelity of garment details while enabling flexibility in image creation.\nTo deal with this problem, we introduce StableGarment, a unified framework built upon Stable Diffusion. This framework is meticulously designed to release the full potential of Stable Diffusion. A garment encoder is devised to encode the details of the target garment. This encoder interfaces with the stable diffusion denoising UNet through an innovative additive self-attention(ASA) mechanism, enhancing the system's versatility in text prompting and model switching. This approach to self-attention facilitates model adaptability for creative try-on purposes. To empower the model with virtual try-on ability, a try-on controlnet is trained.",
        "CNNs have been designed to take advantage of implicit characteristics of natural images, specifically correlation in local neighborhood and feature equivariance. Standard CNNs rely on learned convolutional filters hence finetuned to the data available. However, it can be advantageous to revert to preset filter banks: for instance, with limited training data [1] , using a collection of preset filters can help in avoiding overfitting and in reducing the computational complexity of the system. Scattering networks are an example of such networks with preset (wavelet based) filters which have achieved state-of-the-art results in handwritten digit recognition and texture classification [2] .\nWe propose instead to replace the standard convolutional operations in CNNs by harmonic blocks that learn the weighted sums of responses to the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) filters, see Fig. 1 . DCT has been successfully used for JPEG encoding to trans-Figure 1 : Left: Design of the harmonic block.

Batch normalization (BN) block is optional. Right: Visualization of the harmonic block applied to an input layer.\nform image blocks into spectral representations to capture the most information with a small number of coefficients. Motivated by frequency separation and energy compaction properties of DCT, the proposed harmonic networks rely on combining responses of window-based DCT with a small receptive field. Our method learns how to optimally combine spectral coefficients at every layer to produce a fixed size representation defined as a weighted sum of responses to DCT filters. The use of DCT filters allows one to represent and regularize filter parameters directly in the DCT domain and easily address the task of model compression. Other works that propose convolutional filters decomposition to particular basis functions [3, 4] have predominantly focused on network compression. In our study we demonstrate that prior information coming from well chosen filter basis can not only be used to compress but also speeds up training convergence and improves performance.\nBased on our earlier works [5, 1] , this paper contributions are as follows. First we demonstrate that the theoretical computational overheads of the optimised formulation of a harmonic block are minimal (experimentally, within 3-7%) whereas the memory footprint requirements are comparable to those of the benchmark architecture based on standard convolutional blocks (and are lower if harmonic blocks undergo compression). Second, we substantially expand experimental validation to demonstrate a consistent increase in performance due to the use of harmonic blocks.",
        "Semantic segmentation of point clouds has become an increasingly attended task. Because of the success of 2D image recognition (Long, Shelhamer, and Darrell 2015; Chen et al. 2017) , many works tried to extend 2D convolution network to 3D space directly (Maturana and Scherer 2015; Zhou and Tuzel 2018) . However, this kind of methods is limited by drastic increment of computational complexity. On the other side, PointNet (Qi et al. 2017a ) utilized shared Multi-Layer Perceptrons to directly process point clouds and aggregates information through max-pooling, but it failed to exploit the relationship among points in a local region. Due to the unbalanced distribution of points and irregularity of representation, semantic segmentation of point clouds is still a challenging task.\nThe boundary plays an important role in the semantic segmentation of point clouds, because lots of misclassifications happen nearby boundary points. In the point cloud, the boundary refers to the transition area between two or more * Equal Contribution. \u2020 Corresponding Author. objects belonging to different categories. For example, the junction of the sofa and the ground can be considered as the boundary. Many works (Wang et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018; Wu, Qi, and Fuxin 2019) tackled the segmentation problem in point clouds without explicitly learning or using the boundary information, hence they extracted features from points with no differentiation between boundary and nonboundary points. It is noteworthy that extracted features on the boundary are usually ambiguous, because they mix features of points belonging to different categories on different sides of the boundary. As the network goes deeper, if other points incorporate features of the boundary points, these ambiguous features on the boundary will inevitably propagate to more other points hierarchically. So, the information of different objects will spread across the boundary, leading to a bad contour for final semantic segmentation.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose a Boundary Prediction Module (BPM) to predict boundary points in point clouds. In this module, we give a soft prediction for boundary and this module is skillfully supervised by the ground truth of boundary generated on the fly. It is noteworthy that, compared with semantic segmentation, boundary prediction is easier and likely to obtain better results. So, we introduce the light-weight BPM to predict the boundary. Then, we use the prediction as auxiliary information to boost the performance of segmentation. The BPM and segmentation network are trained jointly in end-to-end manner. Fig. 1 illustrates the predicted boundary in several scenes. Most of them are accurately located between different categories, which also visually reflects the effectiveness of our BPM.\nBased upon the BPM, we design a boundary-aware Geometric Encoding Module (GEM) to utilize the predicted boundary in feature extraction. When aggregating local features, we only allow information sharing within each object area by preventing the propagation of features across boundary. Because local features can provide more detail information, mixing local features of different categories will definitely destroy this detail information. Then, in the following layers of encoder where representative points are sampled and global features are encoded, information belonging to different categories can be transferred through boundary to obtain the global scene information.",
        "Automatic facial behavior analysis has a long history of studies in the intersection of computer vision, physiology and psychology and has applications spread across a variety of fields, such as medicine, health, or driver fatigue, monitoring, e-learning, marketing, entertainment, lie detection and law. However it is only recently, with the collection of large-scale datasets and powerful machine learning methods such as deep neural networks, that automatic facial behavior analysis started to thrive. When it comes to automatically recognising affect inthe-wild (i.e., in uncontrolled conditions and unconstrained environments), there exist three iconic tasks, which are: i) recognition of basic expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and the neutral state); ii) estimation of continuous affect (valence -how positive/negative a person is-and arousal -how active/passive a person is-); iii) detection of facial action units (coding of facial motion with respect to activation of facial muscles, e.g. upper/inner eyebrows, nose wrinkles).\nEkman [11] defined the six basic emotions, i.e., Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise and the Neutral State, based on a cross-culture study [11] , which indicated that humans perceive certain basic emotions in the same way regardless of culture. Nevertheless, advanced research on neuroscience and psychology argued that the model of six basic emotions are culture-specific and not universal. Additionally, the affect model based on basic emotions is limited in the ability to represent the complexity and subtlety of our daily affective displays. Despite these findings, the categorical model that describes emotions in terms of discrete basic emotions is still the most popular perspective for Expression Recognition, due to its pioneering investigations along with the direct and intuitive definition of facial expressions.\nThe dimensional model of affect, that is appropriate to represent not only extreme, but also subtle emotions appearing in everyday human-computer interactions, has also attracted significant attention over the last years. According to the dimensional approach [12, 65, 55] , affective behavior is described by a number of latent continuous dimensions. The most commonly used dimensions include valence (indicating how positive or negative an emotional state is) and arousal (measuring the power of emotion activation).\nDetection of Facial Action Units (AUs) has also attained large attention. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) [11, 2] provides a standardised taxonomy of facial muscles' movements and has been widely adopted as a common standard towards systematically categorising physical manifestation of complex facial expressions.",
        "\"Most of our misunderstandings of other people are not due to any inability to... understand their words... [but that] we so often fail to understand a speaker's intention.\"\n-George Armitage Miller (1974) Certain pragmatic inferences can only be interpreted by individuals with shared backgrounds.\n\u22c6 Equal contribution. For example, what researchers call fun may not be fun for kindergartners. Theories from sociolinguistics, pragmatics, and communication aim to explain how sociocultual background affects interpersonal interaction (Schramm, 1954) especially since variation occurs across several dimensions: class (Bernstein, 2003; Thomas, 1983) , age (Labov, 2011) , gender (Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2013) , race (Green, 2002) , and more. Rigorously modeling how culture affects pragmatic inference on all axes is understandably challenging. The board game Codenames Duet offers a more restricted setting of turn-based word reference between two players. In each round, THE CLUE GIVER provides a single-word clue; then THE GUESSER must interpret this clue to select the intended word references on the game board. Ideal inferences come from the players' common ground-the set of shared beliefs between them (Clark, 1996) . In practice, however, a player's behavior can be idiosyncratic. Each player has knowledge and experience that shape how they interpret clues and make guesses. When players' backgrounds differ, they may be more likely to misinterpret their partner, as seen in Figure 1 .\nInspired by the above, we model the role of sociocultural factors in pragmatic inference with a new task and a series of ablation experiments. First, we describe the CULTURAL CODES dataset of cross-cultural Codenames Duet gameplay, with relevant background information from the players' demographics, personalities, and political and moral values ( \u00a73). Then, we deconstruct each action in a game into a distinct modeling task, taking inspiration from work on cross-cultural pragmatics ( \u00a74). Finally, we model each task with/without sociocultural priors, and highlight how player background improves model performance ( \u00a76).

        "The global e-scooter market size was valued at 20.87 million USD in 2021, which is anticipated to continue to grow at a rapid speed [1] . The features of making short trips efficiently and having a comparatively low cost make e-scooters emerge and expand quickly in major cities all over the world. Some existing research investigated the interactions between vehicles and cyclists, which has similar characteristics to e-scooters in some aspects. However, due to the unique moving characteristics that e-scooters may share the road with mobile vehicles and have unpredicted moving intention, it was found that e-scooter crash characteristics do not fully overlap with those of bicycle crashes [2] . The presence of e-scooters could be risky if e-scooter riders do not behave normally under corresponding regulations. The safety research report published by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) indicated an increase in the use of e-scooters and e-bikes, as well as an increase in e-scooter and e-bike rider fatalities and injuries [3] . Shah et al. [2] found that about 10% of e-scooter-vehicle crashes lead to the injury or fatality of e-scooter riders. Therefore, the interactions between vehicles and e-scooters are critical for traffic safety analysis, which can also be extended to future connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] . Some reallife scenarios also show the potential collision between e- scooters and surrounding vehicles. Several circumstances make the vehicle-e-scooter interactions critical for safety analysis, as demonstrated in Fig. 1 . The real-life traffic data collected in [8] also contained these situations. In Fig. 1(a) , an e-scooter intends to cross the intersection by passing through two parked vehicles and reaching the destination on the other side. However, a moving vehicle might travel across the intersection at the same time. In Fig. 1(b) , an escooter plans to make the lane change to reach the destination where a moving vehicle is approaching from behind. Both scenarios are highly risky since the VEI might result in severe consequences.",
        "Highly constrained problems are at the core of a wide variety of different applications (e.g. scheduling [1] , hardware verification [2] , or robotic manipulation planning [3] ).\nTo robustly tackle such problems, they are represented as constrained optimization or satisfaction problems, and one aims to find a diverse set of feasible solutions.\nFocusing on problems in continuous domains, there are two main approaches to generate solutions: The first is to use a nonlinear solver to generate a joint assignment for all variables simultaneously. If the problem is highly nonlinear, however, joint optimization is sensitive to the initial guess, and is prone to converging to an infeasible point, or repeatedly to the same local optima. The second direction is to decompose the problem using sequential assignment of subsets of variables. However, this approach is often impossible due to joint constraints on variables. Defining dedicated constraint manifold sampling operations and a sampling order to address this issue requires in-depth knowledge of the problem domain. While defining good decompositions is feasible for simple or structured settings, in general, they are suboptimal for complex scenarios.\nWe demonstrate our work on problems arising in robotic sequential manipulation, which requires finding feasible solutions that satisfy the kinematic and dynamic constraints imposed by the robot and the environment, possibly arising from future actions and goals. Such problems implicitly encode discrete structures due to the stable interaction modes that describe the contact-or kinematic switches. These modeswitches are discrete snapshots of the configuration variables when the constraint activity changes, e.g., when the robot picks up an object (Fig. 1 ). Generating a diverse set of feasible mode-switches, and then optimizing the trajectories while considering the whole set can alleviate infeasibility and suboptimality issues that occur when only using one possible mode-switching sequence.\nAs example, consider the mode-switch configurations of a pick-and-place problem, defined with three sets of variables: the robot configurations (joint values) when picking and placing the object, and the relative transformation between the gripper and the object. Some possible sampling sequences to generate a full sample are: (i) optimize all variables jointly, (ii) sample the relative transformation first, and then compute the robot configurations, or (iii) compute the pick configuration and relative transformation first, and then the place configuration.\nIn this work, we present an algorithm to efficiently generate a diverse set of solutions for high-dimensional nonlinear programs containing many infeasible local optima by exploiting its factored structure.",
        "Is a model's understanding of syntax a precondition for its understanding of natural language? Recent work on large language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Tenney et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2021) has made this a popular hypothesis. Yet, models that consume only bag-of-words features but rival those that understand syntax have surprised researchers time and again (Iyyer et al., 2015; Joulin et al., 2017) . New concerns have emerged that natural language understanding benchmarks may not be challenging enough to make sentence structure relevant (McCoy et al., 2019; Niven and Kao, 2019) .\nSyntax is an essential aspect of language (Chomsky, 1965) . Sentence structure can be quite important: two sentences with very different meanings may use the same set of words (Fig. 1 ). But how much does syntax, as realized in word order, matter in typical English text? Given the words that make\nThe scared mouse chased the hungry cat.\nThe hungry cat chased the scared mouse.\nFigure 1 : Which word order is more likely? up a sentence, but not their order, is the order usually recoverable? If so, word order rarely encodes more information than is found in the bag of words.\nIn the past, linguists could not have answered this question empirically. Manually ordering words into sentences is too laborious, and when there are multiple orders that satisfy grammatical constraints, one needs a way to choose among them.\nWith the power of large language models, we can reduce this question to a computational one and resolve both issues: given the bag of words, find the word order that is most likely under a trained LM.\nTo make this search tractable, we develop inference by iterative shuffling (IBIS), a procedure inspired by techniques in combinatorial optimization, that is superior to existing approaches to this problem. Armed with IBIS, we answer the question above statistically and explore the implications.\nFirst, we measure how often sentences and phrases are permutable in text of various genres.\nNext, we analyze the effect of word order on the GLUE suite (Wang et al., 2018) and on the task of autoregressive language modeling. Randomly reordering input words drops the performance of models on nearly all tasks, but when we infer the order with the aid of a pretrained LM, this drop is small or absent. Thus, NLP pipelines can effectively consume bags of words as input, and order carries much less meaning than we might imagine.",
        "Hate speech, often taken to designate insults and attacks against individuals or groups based on their inherent traits, is an expression which is widely used but on whose definition there is no general consensus. Given the subjective and contextual nature of hate speech, it is left open to media platforms (Meta, 2022; Twitter, 2022; Youtube, 2022; Microsoft, 2022b) , research groups (Djuric et al., 2015; Saleem et al., 2017; Mondal et al., 2017; Salminen et al., 2018; Jaki and De Smedt, 2019; Pereira-Kohatsu et al., 2019; Rani et al., 2020; R\u00f6ttger et al., 2021) and individuals to decide what to include under this notion and whether to adjust its definition (Vengattil and Culliford, 2022) . Particularly difficult is drawing the line between hate speech, toxic speech and humour expressed through e.g. irony, sarcasm or euphemisms.\nThe challenges described in this paper show that configuring a stable and robust hate speech classifier is not a trivial task. While this applies to big tech companies who have the data and infrastructure to create, train and maintain their own classification systems, it is often prohibitive for smaller, mostly regional, companies and (online) media outlets. For them, no tailored off-the-shelf solution exists, they often do not have the in-house capacity to develop and maintain their own classification system and are bound by data protection rules tightly regulating which data can be shared with commercial services. The Swiss context presents a particularly challenging case given that many instances of hate speech are deeply ingrained in the multilingual, sociocultural and political contexts of Switzerland (cf. e.g.",

With the advent of digitization, Sanskrit manuscripts have become more accessible [Goyal et al., 2012a; Adiga et al., 2021] , but their utility is still limited due to various linguistic phenomena and the user's lack of language expertise.\nTo make these manuscripts more accessible, this research aims to develop neural-based Sanskrit Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems that can be accessed through a user-friendly web interface. However, the Sanskrit language poses several challenges for building deep learning solutions, including the sandhi phenomenon, rich morphology, frequent compounding, flexible word order, and limited resources. This research identifies 4 essential tasks for processing Sanskrit texts: word segmentation, dependency parsing, compound type identification, and analysis of the aesthetic beauty of Sanskrit poetry.\nThe conventional practice of Sanskrit word segmentation (SWS) is a crucial initial step in processing digitized manuscripts, as it enables accessibility and supports downstream tasks such as text classification [Sandhan et al., 2019; Krishna et al., 2016b] , morphological tagging [Gupta et al., 2020a; Krishna et al., 2018c] , dependency parsing [Sandhan et al., 2021b; Krishna et al., 2020b] , automatic speech recognition [Kumar et al., 2022] etc. Identifying Sanskrit word boundaries in word segmentation (SWS) is complicated due to the linguistic phenomenon of sandhi, which involves phonetic transformations at word boundaries. This can obscure word boundaries and modify characters through deletion, insertion, and substitution operations. For the dependency parsing task, several strategies such as data augmentation, sequential transfer learning, cross-lingual/mono-lingual pretraining, multi-task learning and selftraining are tailored to enhance performance in low-resource scenarios. While these are well-known to the community, it is not trivial to select the best-performing combination of these strategies for a low-resource language that we are interested in, and not much attention has been given to measuring the efficacy of these strategies. Assessing their utility for low-resource languages is essential before inventing novel ways to tackle data sparsity.\nThe Sanskrit compound type identification (SaCTI) task is challenging and often depends upon the context or world knowledge about the entities involved [Krishna et al., 2016b] .\nFor instance, as illustrated in Figure 1 .2, the semantic type of the compound r\u0101ma-\u012b\u015bvarah .\ncan be classified into one of the following semantic types depending on the context: Karmadh\u0101raya2 , Bahuvr\u012bhi and Tatpurus . a. Although the compound has the same components as well as the final form, the implicit relationship between the components can be decoded only with the help of available contextual information [Kulkarni and Kumar, 2013b; Krishna et al., 2016b] . Due to such instances, the downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications for Sanskrit such as question answering [Terdalkar and Bhattacharya, 2019] and machine translation [Aralikatte et al., 2021] , etc. show sub-optimal performance when they stumble on compounds. For example, while translating r\u0101ma-\u012b\u015bvarah .",
        "The availability of high-quality and diverse 3D assets is critical in many domains, including robotics, gaming, architecture, among others. Yet, creating these assets has been a tedious manual process, requiring expertise in difficult-to-use computer graphics tools.\nEmerging 3D generative models offer the ability to easily create diverse 3D assets from simple text prompts or single images [70] . Optimization-based 3D generative methods can produce high-quality assets, but they often require a long time-often hours-to produce a single 3D asset [50, 71, 93, 98, 101] . Recent feed-forward 3D generative methods have demonstrated excellent quality and diversity while offering significant speedups over optimization-based 3D generation approaches [2, 12, 30, 38, 46, 54, 78, 91, 106] .

Trained for fast sparse-view reconstruction (top, \u223c0.1s), GRM works in synergy with other tools (e.g., text-to-multiview generation [46] , image-to-multiview model [79] , and 2D segmentation [45] ) to enable text-to-3D (center top) and image-to-3D (center bottom) generation as well as real-world object reconstruction (bottom).\n(SOTA) models, however, typically build on the triplane representation [5] , which requires inefficient volume rendering. This inefficient rendering step not only hinders fast inference but it often also requires the models to operate at a reduced 3D resolution, limiting representational capacity.\nWe introduce the Gaussian Reconstruction Model (GRM) as a new feed-forward 3D generative model.",
        "For Bob to communicate securely with Alice via publickey encryption, he encrypts a message with Alice's public key (PK), which Alice decrypts with her secret (private) key (SK). Here, Bob (a data owner or DO) knows that it is Alice (a data user or DU) who he would like to communicate with. However, there are situations where a DO would like to share data securely with (multiple) DUs whose identities are not known. For instance, the President of a university may want to send encrypted data to all the Teacher or Research Assistants in the CIS Department, but does not know the identities of all these eligible students.\nIn 2005, Sahai and Waters [1] introduced Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) as the first one-to-many cryptosystem. There are two kinds of ABE: ciphertext policy attributebased encryption (CP-ABE) and key policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE). The first KP-ABE was proposed by Goyal et al. in 2006 [2] and the first CP-ABE by Bethencourt et al. in 2007 [3] .\nIn CP-ABE, a DU receives its SK based on the attributes it possesses. When the DO shares the data securely, the data is encrypted with an access policy. For instance, the University President could share data securely with the policy {\"CIS Department\" & (\"Teacher Assistant, \" || \"Research Assistant\")} so that students with either attribute {\"CIS Department\" & \"Teacher Assistant\"} or {\"CIS Department\" & \"Research Assistant\"} can decrypt the President's ciphertext. In KP-ABE, DUs' SKs are generated based on an specific access policy. Clearly, CP-ABE is more applicable to practical applications.\nThe original ABE systems employ a central authority (CA) which issues SKs to DUs. Such a centralized architecture suf-fers from several issues. Efforts [4] - [13] have been proposed to decentralize ABE to address issues such as key escrow [14] , ineligible DUs [15] , key exposure [16] , forging signatures [17] , privacy of DUs [18] , and flexibility [19] . The main idea of decentralization lies in dividing the responsibilities of the single CA among multiple authorities.\nIn both ABE and decentralized ABE (DABE), the CA/authorities are assumed to work honestly so that all the DOs and DUs are obligated to trust CA/authorities. However, since there is no supervision of CA/authorities, there are situations where DUs would not trust CA or authorities. Therefore, the existing DABE models are not capable of handling these situations.\nTo address the problem of unwillingness to trust CA/authorities, this paper proposes a new DABE scheme termed data user-based ABE (or DU-ABE for short), where the DUs are not obligated to trust CA/authorities. Instead, the DUs themselves take over the responsibilities of CA/authorities.",
        "This paper studies the problem of recovering a structured signal from a relatively small number of corrupted measurements\nEQUATION\nwhere \u03a6 \u2208 R m\u00d7n is the sensing matrix, x \u2208 R n denotes the structured signal to be estimated, v \u2208 R m stands for the structured corruption, and z \u2208 R m represents the unstructured observation noise. The objective is to estimate x and v from given knowledge of y and \u03a6. If v contains some useful information, then this model (1) can be regarded as the signal separation (or demixing) problem. In particular, if there is no corruption (v = 0), then the model (1) reduces to the standard compressed sensing problem. This problem arises in many practical applications of interest, such as face recognition [1] , subspace clustering [2] , sensor network [3] , latent variable modeling [4] , principle component analysis [5] , source separation [6] , and so on. The theoretical aspects of this problem have also been studied under different scenarios in the literature, important examples include sparse signal recovery from sparse corruption [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] , low-rank matrix recovery from sparse corruption [4] , [5] , [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] , and structured signal recovery from structured corruption [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] .\nSince this problem is ill-posed in general, tractable recovery is possible when both signal and corruption are suitably structured. Typical examples of structured signal (or corruption) include sparse vectors and low-rank matrices. Let f (\u2022) and g(\u2022) be suitable proper convex functions which promote structures for signal and corruption respectively. There are three popular convex optimization approaches to reconstruct signal and corruption when different kinds of prior information are available. Specifically, when we have access to the prior knowledge of either signal f (x ) or corruption g(v ) and the noise level \u03b4 (in terms of the 2 norm), it is natural to consider the following constrained convex recovery procedures\nEQUATION\nand\nEQUATION\nWhen only the noise level \u03b4 is known, it is convenient to employ the partially penalized convex recovery procedure\nEQUATION\nwhere \u03bb > 0 is a tradeoff parameter. When there is no prior knowledge available, it is practical to use the fully penalized convex recovery procedure\nEQUATION\nwhere \u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 > 0 are some tradeoff parameters.",
        "The typical dialog system development cycle consists of dialog design, pre-deployment testing, deployment, performance monitoring, model improvement and iteration. As in any production software system, effective and comprehensive testing at all stages is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, evaluating and troubleshooting production TOD systems is still a largely manual process requiring large amount of human conversations with Figure 1 : BotSIM overview including the generator, simulator, and remediator. The dotted (optional) paths from users can be used for bot performance monitoring: they can provide production chat logs or manually crafted utterances when creating evaluation goals.\nthe systems. This process is time-consuming, expensive, and inevitably fails to capture the breadth of language variation present in the real world (Tan et al., 2021) . The time-and labor-intensive nature of such an approach is further exacerbated when the developer significantly changes the dialog flows, since new sets of test dialogs will need to be created (Benvie et al., 2020) . Performing comprehensive end-to-end bot evaluation is highly challenging due to the need for additional annotation efforts. Finally, there is a lack of analytical tools for interpreting test results and troubleshooting underlying bot issues.\nTo address these limitations, we present BotSIM, a Bot SIMulation environment for data-efficient end-to-end commercial bot evaluation, remediation via multi-intent dialog generation and agendabased dialog user simulation (Schatzmann et al., 2007) . BotSIM consists of three major modules, namely Generator, Simulator, and Remediator (Figure 1 ). We use a pretrained sequence-to-sequence T5 model (Zhang et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020) in the Generator to simulate lexical and syntactic variations in user queries via paraphrasing. The Generator is also responsible to generate various templates needed by the Simulator. To make BotSIM more platform-and task-agnostic, we adopt dialogact level ABUS to simulate conversations with bots via APIs. The dialog acts are automatically inferred by the Generator via a unified interface to convert bot designs of different platforms to a universal graph representation. The graph has all dialogs as nodes and their transitions as edges. Through graph traversal, BotSIM offers a principled and scalable approach to generating and exploring multi-intent conversations. Not only can the conversation path generation greatly increase evaluation coverage for troubleshooting dialog errors caused by faulty designs (e.g., unexpected dialog loops), it is also valuable for bot design improvements. The Remediator summarizes bots' health status in a dashboard for easy comprehension. It also analyzes the simulated conversations to identify any issues and further provides actionable suggestions to remedy them.\nBotSIM's \"generation-simulation-remediation\" paradigm can significantly accelerate bot development and evaluation, reducing human efforts, cost and time-to-market.",
        "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a type of dementia that is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects cognitive function, including language processing. One of the most significant language-related changes that occur in individuals with AD is a decline in their lexicon, which refers to the vocabulary and words they use to communicate [1] . The loss of lexicon can be particularly challenging, as it can make it difficult for individuals with dementia to express themselves clearly and to understand others. Early detection of dementia is critical for ensuring timely and appropriate treatment, as well as for improving patient outcomes [2] . In recent years, there has been growing interest in using machine learning with different types of linguistic features as a means of detecting AD at an early stage. Such an approach has several advantages as it is less intrusive, has virtually no side effects, and is cheaper than traditional approaches [3] .\nOne promising approach is the use of lexical features, which are linguistic elements related to vocabulary and word usage. This study uses an automated analysis of transcribed speech as a screening tool for AD.\nAlthough there has been a plethora of works that used lexical features of different types to detect AD and dementia, lexicon wasn't covered with enough depth and width. While current studies have shown promising results in using lexical features for detecting AD, there are still several gaps in our understanding of the impact of AD on lexicon processing. One major limitation of existing studies is that they often rely on a small number of lexical features, limiting the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, there is a lack of consistency in the types of lexical features that are measured and analyzed, making it difficult to compare results across studies.\nTo overcome these limitations, this study covers 99 lexical features. Some of these features have been used in previous studies about dementia, such as Brunet index, and Type Token Ratio (TTR). Other features have been used in other areas but have not been applied to dementia, such as sentiment analysis, Text Focus, and knowledge depth.",
        "Neural classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, producing unexpected predictions when subject to purposefully constructed human-imperceptible input perturbations and hence manifesting severe safety risks (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018) . Existing methods for robust deep neural networks (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) often suffer from significant accuracy penalties on clean (unattacked) data (Tsipras et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Pang et al., 2022) . As deep models continue to form the core of numerous products, trading clean accuracy for robustness is understandably unattractive for real-life users and profit-driven service providers. As a result, despite the continuous development in adversarial robustness research, robust models are rarely deployed and practical services remain non-robust (Ilyas et al., 2018; Borkar & Chen, 2021) .\nTo bridge the gap between robustness research and applications, researchers have considered reconciling robustness and accuracy (Balaji et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Raghunathan et al., 2020; Rade & Moosavi-Dezfooli, 2021; Liu & Zhao, 2022; Pang et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2022) . Most works focused on improving robust training methods, and are thus expensive to implement. Moreover, training-based methods may be incompatible with each other, and can be hard to integrate into recent advancements in large-scale models pre-trained with large real or synthetic datasets. An alternative direction to relieve the accuracy-robustness tradeoff is through an ensemble of a standard (often non-robust) model and a robust model (Bai et al., 2023a; 2024) . This ensemble model is referred to as the mixed classifier, whereas base classifiers refers to its standard and robust components.\nWe observe that many robust base models share a benign confidence property: their correct predictions are much more confident than incorrect ones. Verifying such a property for numerous existing models trained via different methods (Peng et al., 2023; Pang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Debenedetti et al., 2022; Na, 2020; Gowal et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023) , we speculate that strengthening this property can improve the mixed classifiers' trade-off even without changing the base classifiers' predicted classes.\nBased on this intuition, we propose MixedNUTS (Mixed neUral classifiers with Nonlinear TranSformation), a training-free method that enlarges the robust base classifier confidence difference between correct and incorrect predictions and thereby optimizes the mixed classifier's accuracyrobustness trade-off. MixedNUTS applies nonlinear transformations to the accurate and robust base classifiers' logits before converting them into probabilities used for mixing. We parameterize the transformation with only three coefficients and design an efficient algorithm to optimize them for the best trade-off. Unlike (Bai et al., 2023a) , MixedNUTS does not modify base neural network weights or introduce additional components and is for the first time efficiently extendable to larger datasets such as ImageNet. Mixed-NUTS is compatible with various pre-trained standard and robust models and is agnostic to the base model details such as training method, defense norm (\u2113 \u221e , \u2113 2 , etc.), training data, and model architecture. Therefore, MixedNUTS can take advantage of recent developments in accurate or robust classifiers while being general, lightweight, and convenient.\nOur experiments leverage AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020) and strengthened adaptive attacks (details in Appendix B) to confirm the security of the mixed classifier and demonstrate the balanced accuracy and robustness on datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.",
        "Motivation. One important area of focus for zoos and sanctuaries is animal welfare [4] and associated research questions: e.g. does captivity prohibit animals from functioning in a beneficial capacity [2, 14] ; and how does captivity affect the ability of animals to be potentially reintroduced into the wild [8] ? Answering such questions via prolonged monitoring is particularly relevant for Great Apes where many gorilla species are critically endangered [22] . Manual monitoring by specialists [7] , however, is labour intensive.\nContribution. This paper provides a new annotated dataset for Great Ape facial ID and investigates how far YOLOv3 [17] can be used to simultaneously detect and identify individual zoo gorillas based on facial characteristics (see Fig. 1 ). Our contributions are: (1) Collection and annotation of 5,428 samples of 7 western lowland gorillas (see Fig. 2 ); (2) Training and evaluation of the YOLOv3 framework for single frame gorilla face localisation and classification, and (3) Implementation of an offline multi-frame video application that delivers robust IDs in a zoo environment.",
        "Speech separation aims to segregate individual speakers from a mixture signal, and it can be used in many applications, such as speaker diarization, speaker verification or multi-talker speech recognition. Deep learning has allowed an unprecedented separation accuracy compared with the traditional signal processing based methods, however, there are still challenges to address. For instance, in blind source separation, the order of the output speakers is arbitrary and unknown in advance, which forms a speaker label permutation problem during training. Clustering based methods [1] or, more recently, Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) technique [2] have been proposed to alleviate this issue. Although the PIT forces the frames belonging to the same speaker to be aligned with the same output stream, frames inside one utterance can still flip between different sources, leading to a poor separation performance. Alternatively, the initial PIT-based separation model can be further trained with a fixed label training strategy [3] , or a long term dependency can be imposed to the output streams by adding an additional speaker identity loss [4, 5] . Another issue in blind source separation is that the speaker order of the separated signals during inference is also unknown, and needs to be identified by a speaker recognition system.\nAn alternative solution to the label permutation problem is to perform target speaker extraction [6] [7] [8] . In this case, the separation model is biased with information about the identity of the target speaker to extract from the mixture. Typically, a speech extraction \u00a92021 IEEE. Accepted for ICASSP 2021. system consists of two networks, one to generate speaker embeddings, and another one to perform speech extraction. The speaker embedding network outputs a speaker representation from an enrollment signal uttered by the target. The speaker embedding network can be either jointly trained with the speech extraction model to minimise the enhancement loss or trained on a different task, i.e., a speaker recognition task, to access larger speaker variations [9] .",
        "With the introduction of hardware with dedicated triangle rasterization units, hand-crafting rasterization routines in software became largely obsolete. Such custom-built rasterizers have nevertheless remained an ongoing topic of research in order to develop and study new rasterization approaches. Some of them eventually managed to beat hardware rasterization in specific scenarios [LHLW10] , but in general, dedicated hardware remains the fastest approach. Nanite is the first framework that promises practical improvements for 3D games via hybrid software and hardware rasterization [KSW21] . They found that directly rasterizing the fragments of a small triangle with atomic min-max operations can be faster than pushing the triangle through the hardware rendering pipeline. Therefore, only larger triangles are rasterized via hardware.\nPoint-cloud models offer additional opportunities for efficient software rasterization, as the hardware rendering pipeline is largely dedicated to the rasterization of triangles and not points. In this paper, we consider point clouds as 3D models made of colored vertices, where each vertex is projected to exactly one pixel. Although this is a fairly strict limitation, it allows us to device algorithms that compete with graphics APIs that also only support one-pixel points, such as DirectX (POINTLIST primitive) and all backends that use it (WebGL, WebGPU, ANGLE, MS Windows games and applications, ...). We intent to support larger point-sprites in the future and use the evaluated performances of one-pixel points as a baseline for comparisons. Point clouds have no connectivity, so index buffers or vertex duplication are not required. The lack of a connected surface also makes uv-maps and textures irrelevant, which is why colors are typically directly stored on a per-vertex basis. Furthermore, point clouds acquired by laser scanners do not contain surface normals. Normals could be computed in a pre-processing step, but computed normals are not robust in sparsely sampled regions with high-frequency details such as vegetation, strings/cables/wires or even noise. We will therefore not consider normals in this paper, either.\nOur approach builds on [SKW21] to further optimize several aspects of software rasterization of points, which leads to an up to 3x higher brute-force performance. Specifically, our contributions to the state of the art of software rasterization of point clouds are:\n\u2022 Assigning larger workloads to batches to enable efficient batchlevel optimizations.",
        "In recent years, the aerial manipulator system [1] has garnered significant attention. Generally, this system comprises a robotic manipulator and a multi-rotor UAV, giving it the capability to actively interact with its surroundings by performing tasks like grasping and transportation. This is in contrast with traditional aerial automated systems that can only execute passive tasks like monitoring and surveillance. However, the strong coupling between the aerial vehicle and the robotic manipulator presents a significant challenge for precise control and manipulation. Specifically, the motion of the robot arm can lead to disturbances from the UAV perspective. Moreover, owing to the under-actuated nature of multi-rotor UAVs, it may be challenging for the UAV to correct the disturbance and achieve accurate tracking. From a control perspective, the aerial manipulation system can be treated as two controlled objects with two separate controllers designed for aerial vehicles and manipulators. The dynamic effect caused by the motion of the manipulator on multi-rotor UAV is difficult to model, and thus it can be treated as external forces and torques [2] , [3] . Therefore, most related works focused on UAV anti-disturbance control. A Variable Parameter Integral Back-stepping (VPIB) [4] UAV control approach taking the motion of the arm into account, which outperforms the results of traditional cascaded PID controller. Based on a novel disturbances estimator, impedance [2] and passivity-based [3] control methods are implemented for UAV to compensate for the estimated disturbances. In addition, a combination of disturbance observer (DoB) and robust control approach [5] is proposed to deal with the external forces and model uncertainties. According to the dynamic model of UAV, a disturbance compensation robust H \u221e controller combined with a disturbance estimator is designed to increase stability. At the same time, the aerial manipulator conducts hovering operation tasks.\nTerminal sliding mode control (TSMC) is increasingly popular due to its ability to handle system uncertainties and external disturbances. While TSMC has not yet been implemented on aerial manipulators, several sliding mode control methods have been developed for multi-rotor UAVs to enhance robustness and stability, as shown in Xu's work [6] .",
        "Over the past decade, there has been a notable acceleration in the progress of autonomous driving vehicle technology, mainly driven by significant advancements in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Autonomous driving requires the ability to make decisions in dynamic and unpredictable situations [1] . The decision-making technique in autonomous driving can be guided either by optimization-based rules such as lane-keeping control or by data-driven machine intelligence like reinforcement learning [2] . While rule-based approaches are often criticized for their limited generalizability in complex traffic situations [3, 2] , data-driven approaches like deep learning and reinforcement learning have shown better performance in certain intricate scenarios [4, 2] .\nFigure 1 : Workflow of hybrid reasoning of LLM in CARLA Despite the achievements of current autonomous driving methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL) has some challenges. One such challenge is the absence of formal guarantees regarding agent behavior, making it difficult to ensure consistently correct decisions, particularly in complex scenarios that require sophisticated reasoning. Additionally, RL may encounter difficulties in unfamiliar situations, resulting in a potential decline in performance. Given these challenges, we investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly their intricate reasoning capabilities can serve as a complementary assistance to improve decision-making in autonomous driving.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) employ an optimized transformer architecture in an auto-regressive manner [5] . These models are primarily trained on an extensive dataset containing trillions of tokens and incorporating billions of parameters. Subsequently, they undergo supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences, emphasizing both helpfulness and safety. Recent investigations have showcased LLMs' capacity to tackle intricate tasks such as arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning, is achieved through an approach termed Chain-of-thought prompting [6] .\nThis paper aims to assess and investigate hybrid reasoning, specifically in the context of arithmetic within commonsense reasoning for autonomous vehicle decision-making with LLM inside CARLA [7] as run-time evaluation under various meteorological conditions. To achieve this goal, we adopt a prompting approach anchored in object detection. Our decision-making reasoning workflow is depicted in Figure 1 . In hybrid reasoning, combining arithmetic and commonsense elements, we utilize the objects detected by YOLOv8, illustrated as part 1 in Figure 1 .",
        "Many techniques in modern computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) make the assumption that approaches that work well on English and other widely used European (and sometimes Asian) languages are \"language agnostic\" -that is that they will also work across the typologically diverse languages of the world. 1 In high-resource languages, especially those that are analytic rather than synthetic, a common approach is to treat morphologically-distinct variants of a common root (such as dog and dogs) as completely independent word types. Doing so relies on two main assumptions: that there exist a limited number of morphological inflections for any given root, and that most or all of those variants will appear in a large enough corpus (conditioned on assumptions about domain, etc.) so that the model can adequately learn statistics about each variant. Approaches like stemming, lemmatization, morphological analysis, subword segmentation, or other normalization techniques are frequently used when either of those assumptions are likely to be violated, particularly in the case of synthetic languages like Czech and Russian that have more inflectional morphology than English.\nWithin the NLP literature, agglutinative languages like Finnish and Turkish are commonly held up as extreme examples of morphological complexity that challenge common modelling assumptions. Yet, when considering all of the world's languages, Finnish and Turkish are closer to the average case in terms of synthesis. When we consider polysynthetic languages (those at the extreme of morphological complexity), approaches like stemming, lemmatization, or subword modelling may not suffice. These languages have very high numbers of hapax legomena (words appearing only once in a corpus), underscoring the need for appropriate morphological handling of words, without which there is no hope for a model to capture enough statistical information about those words. Moreover, many of these languages have only very small text corpora, substantially magnifying these challenges. The remainder of this work is structured as follows.\nIn Chapter 2 we briefly review the relevant background literature in finite-state morphology, language modelling, and machine translation. We review finite-state approaches to morphological analysis. We review the major approaches to language modelling, including n-gram language models, feed-forward language models, and recurrent neural language models.\nIn Chapter 3 we present a set of polysynthetic languages which we will consider throughout this work and detail the resources available for each. We have a particular focus on Inuit-Yupik, a highly challenging family of endangered polysynthetic languages that ranges geographically from Greenland through northern Canada and Alaska to far eastern Russia. The languages in this family are extraordinarily challenging from a computational perspective, with pervasive use of derivational morphemes in addition to rich sets of inflectional suffixes and phonological challenges at morpheme boundaries.\nIn Chapters 4-6 we examine the current state-of-the-art in language modelling, machine translation, and predictive text completion in the context of four polysynthetic languages: Guaran\u00ed, St. Lawrence Island Yupik, Central Alaskan Yup'ik, and Inuktitut. In Chapter 4 we present experiments and results on machine translation into, out of, and between polysynthetic languages; we carry out experiments between various Inuit-Yupik languages and English, as well as between Guaran\u00ed and Spanish, showing that multilingual approaches incorporating data from higher-resource members of the language family can effectively improve translation into lower-resource lan- 1 Emily Bender provides a thorough discussion of this problem in https://thegradient.pub/ the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/.\nFigure 1 .1: Overview of the tangible artefacts, models, and applications in this report. We start with all of the available resources for a given language, including (bi-)texts, grammars, and dictionaries. These are used to create finite-state morphological analyzers and MT systems ( \u00a74) directly. The finite-state morphological analyzers are then applied to corpora to create segmented or analyzed corpora ( \u00a72). These are used both to build language models ( \u00a75) and machine translation systems ( \u00a74) based on the segmented morphemes and to create interpretable morpheme-based language models using tensor product representations ( \u00a77).",
        "Regular languages admit a plethora of equivalent representations: finite automata, finite monoids, regular expressions, formulas of monadic second-order logic, and numerous others. In many cases, the most succinct representation is given by a nondeterministic finite automaton (nfa) . Therefore, the investigation of state-minimal nfas is of both computational and mathematical interest. However, this turns out to be surprisingly intricate; in fact, the task of minimizing an nfa, or even of deciding whether a given nfa is minimal, is known to be PSPACE-complete [ ]. One intuitive reason is that minimal nfas lack structure: a language may have many non-isomorphic minimal nondeterministic acceptors, and there are no clearly identified and easily verifiable mathematical properties distinguishing them from non-minimal ones. As a consequence, all known algorithms for nfa minimization (and related problems such as inclusion or universality testing) require some form of exhaustive search [ , , ] . This sharply contrasts the situation for minimal deterministic finite automata (dfa): they can be characterized by a universal property making them unique up to isomorphism, which immediately leads to efficient minimization.\nIn the present paper, we work towards the goal of bringing more structure into the theory of nondeterministic state-minimality. To this end, we propose a novel algebraic perspective on nfas resting on boolean representations of monoids, i.e. morphisms M \u2192 JSL(S, S) from a monoid M into the endomorphism monoid of a finite join-semilattice S.

SCHR / -free monoid \u03a3 * recognizing a given regular language L \u2286 \u03a3 * . The largest such monoid is \u03a3 * itself, while the smallest one is the syntactic monoid syn(L). For both of them, L induces a canonical boolean representation \u03a3 * \u2192 JSL(SLD(L), SLD(L) and syn(L) \u2192 JSL(SLD(L), SLD(L))\non the semilattice SLD(L) of all finite unions of left derivatives of L. The first representation gives rise to an algebraic characterization of minimal nfas:\nTheorem. The size of a state-minimal nfa for L equals the least degree of any extension of the canonical representation of \u03a3 * induced by L.\nHere, the degree of a representation refers to the number of join-irreducibles of the underlying semilattice. In the light of this result, it is natural to ask for an analogous automata-theoretic perspective on the canonical representation of syn(L) and its extensions. For this purpose, we introduce the class of subatomic nfas, a generalization of atomic nfas earlier introduced by Brzozowski and Tamm [ ]. In order to get a handle on them, we employ an algebraic framework that interprets nfas in terms of JSL-dfas, i.e. deterministic finite automata in the category of semilattices.",
        "S MART TVs present both privacy and security risks. Fea- tures such as Internet-based media playing and thirdparty app executing make modern TVs smarter and yet more vulnerable to security attacks and privacy intrusions. A variety of vulnerabilities have been exploited against smart TVs in recent years [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] . In general, security threats against smart TVs can be classified into two categories: threats from Internet, and threats from programs running on smart TV OSes (e.g., Android TV OS [9] ). In response, smart TV manufacturers and TV OS providers have deployed a variety of protection measures.\nWhile security researchers and TV manufacturers are making a concerted effort to strengthen smart TVs, we observed that they often ignore a new attack surfacemulti-channel remote control communication. Figure 1 depicts a typical application scenario: a smart TV simultaneously supports three types of remote controls using different signals, i.e., Consumer Infrared (IR) [10] , Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) [11] , and Wi-Fi. In addition to remote controls provided by specialized TV accessories, a smart phone can be used as a remote control when installing a companion app developed by the TV manufacturer. By sending BLE and Wi-Fi signals, users can interact with the TV. This companion app simulated remote control is generally more powerful than those classical remote controls since it can fully make use of the resources of the host smart phone.\nAlthough multi-channel remote control communication enhances easy-of-use and flexibility for smart TV users, it weakens security: a smart TV often treats its remote controls as benign accessories, and neither effectively authenticates their identities nor verifies data they send. Unfortunately, most remote controls lack necessary protection, and thus attackers could easily impersonate a remote control or tamper the wireless traffic. More seriously, to support enhanced features (e.g., playing video files from a companion app simulated remote control), smart TV OSes add remote control interfaces to handle sophisticated remote commands and execute privileged operations. If the access control mechanisms of those interfaces are not well designed, attackers could simply abuse them to hijack the TV (i.e., monitoring the screen, displaying contents, and controlling the user interface (UI) of the TV).\nEVILSCREEN Attack. In this paper, we present a new type of attack, EVILSCREEN, against multi-channel communication between a smart TV and its remote controls. Unlike existing attacks that need to install a malicious app on the TV or exploit the TV OS, EVILSCREEN only reuses communications of remote controls to hijack the victim TV, making it more difficult to detect and prevent the attack. We found that the root cause of this attack is a multi-channel remote control mimicry vulnerability (EVILSCREEN vulnerability for short). In general, an EVILSCREEN vulnerability is a smart TV access control bug which allows an attacker to combine three types of wireless communications together (i.e., IR, BLE, and Wi-Fi) to circumvent the authentication and isolation policies of each single remote control.",
        "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a popular solution for performing autonomous inspection of various structures, such as windturbines. The attractive aspect of this approach is the ability to perform non destructive testing (NDT) without putting people at risk. This has led to the development of UAV-based inspection techniques in a range of tasks. Traditionally, wind turbine inspection involved either the dangerous task of personnel climbing the windturbine or in some cases the expensive task of unmounting the rotor blades for inspection. In this work, a method is proposed for performing autonomous visual inspection of the rotor blades using a UAV while the turbine is rotating. Previous work on visual inspection of stationary wind turbines involves the need to halt normal wind turbine operation, making it inconvenient and expensive. Performing inspection on a rotating wind turbine, on the other hand, circumvents this problem.\nSeveral previous studies have explored the use of UAVs, mainly quadrotors, for the inspection of stationary wind turbines. For example, vision based inspection systems of wind turbines are presented in articles such as [1] - [4] .\nAuthors are with Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia (authors) at fer.hr\nIn [1] a vision based system for UAV wind turbine inspection is designed and the results presented both in simulation and Hardware-In-The-Loop testing. The system uses a LiDAR sensor and a camera for the vision pipeline integrating the YOLOv3 network and a customized Hough transform algorithm. Furthermore, in [2] a machine vision module for the navigation of an UAV during the inspection of stationary wind turbines is presented. It implements the estimation of the relative position and distance between the UAV and the wind turbine, and the position of the blades. The system utilized the Hough transform for detection and the Kalman filter for tracking. Experiments show the accuracy and robustness of the solution. Once again, [3] studies autonomous inspection flights at a wind turbine, focusing on the generation of an a-priori 3D map of the wind turbine, and path planning and collision avoidance algorithms. The system relies on a GPS and a 2D LiDAR sensor to collect point clouds which are used for the relative localization process. Moreover, in [4] the team on whose work this study is based on presents a semi-autonomous wind turbine blade inspection system with a LiDAR-equipped UAV. The process performs successful wind turbine blade inspections with minimal operator involvement and results in blade images and a wind turbine 3D model. The method is tested and validated in a real life setting. Lastly, in [5] a review of NDT techniques for wind turbines is given, giving more insight into the actual inspection techniques rather than the manner in which they are carried out (manually or automated).\nWhen talking about the use of UAVs for the inspection of rotating wind turbines, however, the research is very limited. This is a more challenging task due to the dynamic nature of the moving turbine and the need to maintain a safe distance of the UAV from the rotating blades at all times.",
        "Modern machine learning techniques have achieved unprecedented success over the past decades in numerous areas. However, one fundamental limitation of most existing techniques is that a model trained on one dataset cannot generalize well on another dataset if it is sampled from a different distribution. Domain generalization (DG) aims to alleviate the prediction gap between the observed source domains and an unseen target domain by leveraging the knowledge extracted from multiple source domains (Blanchard, Lee, and Scott 2011; Muandet, Balduzzi, and Sch\u00f6lkopf 2013; Arjovsky et al. 2019; Li et al. 2018a) .\nExisting DG methods can be roughly categorized into three groups: data augmentation / generation, disentangled / domain-invariant feature learning, and meta-learning (Wang et al. 2021) . In many real-world applications, the temporal dynamics across domains are common and can be leveraged to improve accuracy for the unseen target domain (Kumar, Ma, and Liang 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Wang, He, and Katabi 2020) . However, one intrinsic problem with these existing DG methods is that most of them treat all the domains equally and ignore the relationship between them, implicitly assuming that they are all sampled from a stationary environment. For example, it is common that source domains are constituted of images collected over the last few years and the target domain is the unseen future. For geological applications, the source samples can be collected along different altitudes, longitude, and latitude, while the target is to generalize to some regions where the data is absent due to inaccessibility. Medical data is also often collected with age or other indicators as intervals, and we hope the model can perform well on younger or elder age groups where the samples may be rare. As a more concrete example, Fig. 1 (a) shows several instances from the rotated MNIST (RMNIST) dataset, a widely used benchmark in the DG literature, where the digit images of each subsequent domain are rotated by 15 \u2022 . Fig. 1 (b) reports the generalization performances of several state-of-the-art DG algorithms on the data set, from which it can be clearly observed that the performances drop when deploying the models on outer domains (i.e., domains of 0 and 75 degrees). The results indicate that the algorithms ignore the evolving pattern between the domains. Consequently, they are good at \"interpolation\" but not at \"extrapolation\".\nIn this paper, we address this learning scenario as temporal domain generalization (TDG) (Zeng et al. 2023; Bai, Ling, and Zhao 2022; Nasery et al. 2021; Qin, Wang, and Li 2022) , which aims to capture and exploit the temporal dynamics in the environment. TDG aims to generalize to a target domain along a specific direction by extracting and leveraging the relations between source domains. Specifically, we develop a novel theoretical analysis that highlights the importance of modeling the relation between two consecutive domains to extract the evolving pattern of the environment. Koopman theory (Koopman 1931) states that any complex dynamics can be modeled by a linear Koopman operator acting on the space of measurement functions.",
        "Discovering causality from observations is a fundamental task in statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we follow Rubin (1974) to define a causal effect as the difference between the average outcomes resulting from two different actions, i.e., the average treatment effect (ATE). One of these actions corresponds to the treatment and the other corresponds to the control (Imbens & Rubin, 2015) . One naive method for estimating the ATE using scientific experiments is the randomized control trial (RCT). In an RCT, we randomly assign one of the two actions to each research subject (Kendall, 2003) to obtain an unbiased estimator of the ATE (Imbens & Rubin, 2015) . However, while an RCT is a reliable method for scientific experiments, it often requires a large sample size for estimating the ATE precisely enough. To mitigate this problem, adaptive experimental designs have garnered increasing attention in various fields such as medicine and social science (Chow SC, 2005; van der Laan, 2008; Komiyama et al., 2009; Hahn et al., 2011; Chow & Chang, 2011; Villar et al., 2015; FDA, 2019) . Compared to usual non-adaptive designs, adaptive designs often allow experimenters to detect the true causal effect while exposing fewer subjects to potentially harmful treatment. This motivates the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to recommend adaptive designs (FDA, 2019) . This paper proposes an adaptive experimental design that sequentially estimates a treatment assignment probability that minimizes the asymptotic variance of an estimator of the ATE and assigns a treatment according to the estimated probability. The proposed method is inspired by van der Laan (2008) and Hahn et al. (2011) . Hahn et al. (2011) considers a situation in which a researcher can separate research subjects into two groups. They proposed estimating an optimal assignment probability that minimizes the asymptotic variance of a semiparametric efficient estimator of the ATE with the first group and, then, assign treatments to the second group following the estimated probability.",
        "Data center providers need to maximize server utilization, in order to obtain the greatest possible benefit from their large capital investments [2, 3] . Many HPC applications, however, only achieve a fraction of the theoretical peak performance, even when they have been carefully optimized [4] . This can lead to a substantial waste of resources across the whole data center.\nIn HPC systems, resource efficiency is an important and growing concern to achieving exascale computing performance. To reach exascale using current technology, would require an unrealistic amount of energy. Even worse, the electricity bill to sustain these platforms considering their lifespan can be roughly equal to their hardware cost [5] . While energyproportional designs [6] could be a solution for HPC systems, this technology is still maturing. Thus, exascale systems are expected to be resource-constrained in the near future, which means the amount of provisioned power will severely limit the scalability to meet new user demands [7, 8] .\nUnder a resource-constrained server environment, minimizing resource usage while meeting performance requirements is key to keeping up with increased computational demands. Techniques like hardware over-provisioning can be applied as a solution for systems with strict power bounds. The idea behind over-provisioning is to use less power per node and thereby allowing more nodes in the system [7] . In real settings, overprovisioning can be implemented by enforcing socket-level power limits with Intel's RAPL technology [9] . RAPL relies on updating registers to manage power usage of the server components (processor, DRAM, GPUs, etc.). It works by monitoring low-level hardware events to estimate power consumption [10] , and it adapts the processor voltage and frequency to meet the desired power cap during a specified time interval.\nTechniques like DVFS also adapt the processor voltage and frequency to reduce processor power consumption. Lower frequencies require less power, potentially resulting in energy reduction in the system [11] . Although this can improve energy efficiency, it may negatively impact the processor performance. Either DVFS or RAPL alone is insufficient for running in an over-provisioned environment, since it only enforces power bound for individual components, such as the CPU. Then, the power bound across all components needs to be enforced by a global scheduler to avoid violating the system bound [12] . A promising way to increase overall system utilization and efficiency is to run multiple applications concurrently on a server node, an approach that is known as workload colocation [2, 3, 13, 14, 15, 1] . The biggest disadvantage of workload colocation is the potential degradation in application performance due to sharing of resources such as caches, memory controllers, data prefetchers, and I/O devices. Such degradation is hard to predict in real systems, and it is impractical to measure the degradation of all pairs of applications ahead of time.\nDue to the uncertain degradation effects, HPC systems usually do not support the sharing of resources in the same computing node among applications [16, 2] . Nevertheless, workload colocation does have a substantial potential to improve system throughput, especially when the colocated applications are bottlenecked on different resources [4, 1] . Note that this improvement in system utilization is made without any need to modify the application's source code.",
        "In a famous scene from the motion picture \"Titanic\", Rose makes a request of Jack: \"...draw me like one of your French girls\". Albeit simple, this request contains a wealth of information. It indicates that Jack should produce a drawing; It suggests that its style and composition should match those of a subset of Jack's prior work; Finally, through a single word, \"me\", Rose indicates that this drawing should portray a specific, unique subject: Rose herself. In making her request, Rose relies on Jack's ability to reason over these conceptsboth broad and specific -and bring them to life in a new creation.\nRecently, large-scale text-to-image models (Rombach et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2021 Ramesh et al., , 2022;; Nichol et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022) have demonstrated an unprecedented capability to reason over natural language descriptions. They allow users to synthesize novel scenes with unseen compositions and produce vivid pictures in a myriad of styles. These tools have been used for artistic creation, as sources of inspiration, and even to design new, physical products (Yacoubian, 2022) . Their use, however, is constrained by the user's ability to describe the desired target through text. Turning back to Rose, one could then ask: How might she frame her request if she were to approach one of these models? How could we, as users, ask text-to-image models to craft a novel scene containing a cherished childhood toy? Or to pull our child's drawing from its place on the fridge, and turn it into an artistic showpiece?\nIntroducing new concepts into large scale models is often difficult. Re-training a model with an expanded dataset for each new concept is prohibitively expensive, and fine-tuning on few examples typically leads to catastrophic forgetting (Ding et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022) . More measured approaches freeze the model and train transformation modules to adapt its output when faced with new concepts (Zhou et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021; Skantze & Willemsen, 2022) . However, these approaches are still prone to forgetting prior knowledge, or face difficulties in accessing it concurrently with newly learned concepts (Kumar et al., 2022; Cohen et al., 2022) .\nWe propose to overcome these challenges by finding new words in the textual embedding space of pre-trained text-to-image models. We consider the first stage of the text encoding process (Figure 2 ). Here, an input string is first converted to a set of tokens. Each token is then replaced with its own embedding vector, and these vectors are fed through the downstream model. Our goal is to find new embedding vectors that represent new, specific concepts.\nWe represent a new embedding vector with a new pseudo-word (Rathvon, 2004) which we denote by S * .",
        "G RAPH neural networks (GNNs) have achieved un- precedented success in graph-based machine learning. Compared with traditional algorithms, GNNs achieve superior performance for a wide variety of applications [1] , such as recommendation systems, social media [2] , etc. Low-latency GNN inference is needed in many real-world applications. Examples include real-time traffic prediction [3] , and GNN-based scientific simulation [4] .\nAccelerating GNN inference is challenging because GNN inference [5] , [6] , [7] requires both sparse and dense computation kernels. While the sparse computation kernels result in poor data reuse and irregular memory access patterns, the dense computation kernels can be executed with regular memory access patterns. General purpose processors (e.g., CPU, GPGPU) are inefficient for GNN inference due to (1) complex cache hierarchy that results in ineffective on-chip memory utilization due to the poor spatial and temporal locality, (2) the general microarchitecture designs are inefficient for various computation kernels in GNNs (i.e., GEMM, SpDMM, and SDDMM). For GPUs, the stateof-the-art GNN frameworks (e.g., Pytorch Geometric (PyG) [8] , Deep Graph Library (DGL) [9] ) have large inference latency due to (1) large GPU kernel launch time, and (2) suboptimal execution paradigm for sparse computation leading to large memory traffic. For example, due to the large GPU global memory footprint for storing the intermediate results, programs written with PyG spend 55%-99% [5] time executing the sparse computations of GNN inference. Many GNN accelerators [5] , [6] , [7] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] have been proposed to overcome the inefficiency of CPUs and GPUs. Previous works either directly design accelerators for specific GNN models [10] , [11] or develop design automation frameworks [6] , [12] , [13] to generate FPGA accelerators for a specific GNN model and an input graph.",
        "In this paper, we introduce several algorithmic developments and refinements of FeTrIL, as introduced in Petit et al. (2023) [12] . We delve deeper into the capabilities of this recently proposed Enhanced Feature Consistency Incremental Learning (EFCIL) method through comprehensive experimentation. FeTrIL uniquely combines a frozen feature extractor with a pseudo-feature generator, leveraging geometric translation to maintain a robust representation of both new and past classes within the feature space. To further validate and refine our approach, we have embarked on a series of experiments to explore the impacts of oversampling and optimization techniques on incremental learning performance.\nOur analysis reveals that the utility of oversampling is contingent on the feature density across classes. Specifically, in scenarios where the feature count per image is relatively low, oversampling can significantly boost accuracy. Conversely, when the feature count is inherently high, oversampling may lead to diminished returns. This effect is pronounced across different datasets such as CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet, each comprising 500 images, versus ImageNet-Subset with 1500 images. These findings underscore the nuanced relationship between feature availability and incremental learning efficacy, as documented in Table II .\nFurther experimentation with a dynamic recalibration technique demonstrates marked benefits for large and diverse datasets. By more accurately mirroring the shifting data distribution across learning states, this method ensures the pseudo-features remain closely aligned with actual feature distributions, a crucial factor for sustaining accuracy amidst the addition of new classes. Comparatively, optimization methods, applied to the initial pseudo-features generated from the geometric translation, which draw features from an expanded pool including multiple new classes, exhibit performance enhancements by enriching the pseudo-feature composition.\nA nuanced observation from our study involves the potential drawbacks of optimization methods that apply feature replacements where the feature pool lacks sufficient diversity, leading to a repetition of features in the optimized set. Our exploration of various optimization strategies, ranging from single-feature selection in to the diverse feature pooling and dynamic recalibration, illuminates the critical balance between feature diversity and optimization efficacy in enhancing model performance.\nThis expanded investigation not only reaffirms the robustness of the FeTrIL framework but also illuminates the intricate dynamics at play in feature-based incremental learning. By integrating these nuanced findings, we are poised to further refine FeTrIL's architecture and optimization techniques, driving forward the frontier of EFCIL research.",
        "Visualizing categorical data in statistical graphics such as bar charts, line charts, or scatterplots is most commonly realized by encoding each category (or class) with a unique color. One major task during visual analysis is then to discriminate between the different classes. While it is well-known that class discriminability is strongly influenced by the assigned colors [9, 17] , finding an appropriate set of colors for the different classes in a specific visualization is still a complex and time-consuming endeavor, even for experts.\nThe most common way to obtain an appropriate color mapping is to find a good color palette first and then assign the colors to classes in the best possible way. To ease this procedure, a few color palette tools have been provided, such as ColorBrewer [11] or Colorgorical [10] , which allow users to select highly discriminable and preferable palettes. Since the creation of such palettes ignores the specific data of a visualiza-tion, a good palette might still not be optimal to visually discriminate classes in different forms of visualization. Hence, users often need to try different palettes and color assignment schemes until the desired result is achieved. Recently, Wang et al. [36] proposed a method that automatically assigns colors of a given palette to classes of multi-class scatterplots by maximizing their discriminability. This technique enables users to bypass the second stage of the standard color assignment process, but it is limited to scatterplots and still requires the author to select a good palette. In contrast, Chen et al. [6] proposed an automatic color selection approach for multi-class scatterplots by searching discriminative colors in the a* and b* channel of the CIELAB space. However, leaving out L* channel often does not allow to find colors with high enough discriminability, especially when the number of classes is large. Since such an approach directly colorizes multi-class scatterpots without any input palette, we refer to it as Colorization in this paper.\nTo fill this gap, we propose Palettailor, a data-aware color palette generation framework, that automatically generates categorical palettes with maximized discriminability for different visualization types.",
        "Multi-agent systems have recently seen tremendous progress in teams of purely artificial agents, especially in computer games (Vinyals et al. 2019; Guss et al. 2019; OpenAI et al. 2019) . However, many real-world scenarios like autonomous driving (Sadigh et al. 2018; Fisac et al. 2019) , assisted robots (Agrawal and Williams 2017; Li et al. 2019) , and Unmanned Aerial System (McNeese et al. 2018; Demir, McNeese, and Cooke 2017) do not guarantee teams of homogeneous robots with shared information -more often, it involves interaction with different kinds of humans who may have varying and unknown intents and beliefs. Understanding these intents and beliefs is crucial for robots to interact with humans effectively in this scenario. Human-agent teaming (HAT) (Scholtz 2003; Chen and Barnes 2014) , an emerging form of human-agent systems, requires teamwork to be a set of interrelated reasoning, actions and behaviors of team members that combine to fulfill team objectives (Morgan Jr et al. 1986; Salas, Sims, and Burke 2005; Salas, Cooke, and Rosen 2008) . In this paper, we focus on the setting of two-player human-agent teaming in a computer game, where the agent should cooperate with the human in real-time to achieve a common goal on one task. The human playing that role may be any person with any policy at any time, and potentially not be an expert in the task at hand.\nOne of the fundamental challenges for an artificial agent to work with a human, instead of simply another artificial agent, is that humans may have complex or unpredictable behavioral patterns and intent (Chen and Barnes 2012; Green and Bavelier 2006) . In particular, they may misuse or disuse the multi-agent system based on their perception, attitude and trust towards the system (Parasuraman and Riley 1997) . This difference becomes very critical in scenarios where an agent interacts with a diverse population of human players, each of which might have different intents, beliefs, and skills (ranging from novices to experts) (Kurin et al. 2017) . To succeed, cooperative agents must be able to infer human intent or policy to inform their action accordingly.\nCapabilities of adapting to humans are essential for a human-agent team to safely deploy and collaborate in a real-time environment (Bradshaw, Feltovich, and Johnson 2011) . Real-time adaptation is critical in practical deployments where robots are not operating unilaterally in a controlled environment, such as urban driving environments for autonomous vehicles (Fisac et al. 2019) .",
        "The field of social dynamics studies behaviors that result from groups of interacting individuals that self-organize in particular ways. It is also one of the pillars of complexity science, and has ramifications in sociology, psychology, economics, animal behavior, and numerous fields. One of the most data-rich areas for the study of such social phenomena can be found in online communities, in particular on collaborative platforms such as wikis, Q&A websites, and social media. This project focuses on Reddit, an online discussion platform that also hosted a collaborative social experiment on April Fools' Day of 2017, called Place (or r/place, the sub-community created for the occasion). The experiment involved an online canvas, which registered users could edit by changing the color of a single pixel from a 16-color palette. After each pixel was placed, a timer prevented the user from placing any pixels for a period of time between 5 and 20 minutes (Simpson et al., 2017) .\nIn just 72 hours, over a million registered Reddit users placed 16.5 million pixels to transform a simple, blank, 1000\u00d71000-pixel canvas into a surprisingly beautiful clash of communities, nations, and ideologies. Because each user could only place one pixel every 5-20 minutes, any single individual would have struggled to create a meaningful image on their own. However, through community collaboration, users quickly produced complex creations, surpassing all of our expectations about how this project would turn out once the 72 hours were up. Reddit released pixel-bypixel placement data and additional community efforts were spurred to produce additional canvas analysis.",
        "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) implements all-day, allweather observation of the earth using the synthetic aperture principle to achieve high-resolution microwave imaging. It is vital to accurately and quickly classify the ships in SAR images in performing some sea surface missions. However, SAR ship classification using data-driven deep learning faces a more significant overfitting challenge compared to optical images, mainly due to the few-shot SAR ship and noisy data.\nWith the rapid progress of deep learning in image processing, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained increasing popularity in the field of SAR ship classification [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, the complex CNN model may introduce redundant features that will further amplify the risk of overfitting. The knowledge distillation (KD) [5] that transfer knowledge from a cumbersome pre-trained teacher model to a lightweight student model has benn widely utilized in various SAR tasks [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . All of the works inherit the idea of knowledge transfer from the traditional KD. Recently, [14] attributed the success of KD to the regularization effect of soft labels provided by teacher model from the LSR perspective, revealing the great potential of applying KD in the field of regularization.\nTo improve the generalization of SAR ship classification, this paper introduce a double reverse regularization network which incorporates both online and offline distillation.",
        "With the increasing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), more and more tasks that were traditionally solved using human experts and statistical models are now aided by LLMs. Understanding how a model produces its output is an essential factor in the human acceptance of machine learning systems (Shin, 2021) . However, understanding the connection between input and output in LLMs is not easily possible (Adadi and Berrada, 2018) .\nRecent advances in LLMs generating longer coherent text have popularised self-rationalising models, which produce a natural language explanation (NLE) alongside their output (Hase et al., 2020; Marasovic et al., 2021) . NLEs have numerous benefits over other, non-textual explanations: NLEs are valued more highly by human users (Forrest et al., 2018) , they can be applied to a broad range of problems and they can combine external knowledge with the model input. However, even though the NLEs can give insights into how plausible the predictions made by LLMs are, the faithfulness of the explanations to the prediction process remains at best uncertain (Wiegreffe et al., 2021; Atanasova et al., 2023; Turpin et al., 2023) .\nIn this work, we propose exploring the patterns behind generated NLEs using a hypothesis-driven framework, with the ultimate goal of deriving a surrogate model. Our framework is centred around a hypothetical global explanation (HGE): A hypothesis about how the LLM solves a specific task on a global, structural level. While we start off with an obviously oversimplified hypothesis to introduce and test the framework, we envision that it can be incrementally adapted to more refined hypotheses in the future. The patterns captured by each refinement step can then serve to measure their coverage, or e-recall (Goldberg, 2023) , in the LLM.\nThe core component of our framework is a statistical surrogate model (SSM) that reflects the HGE.",
        "Breast cancer has been reported as one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Although, digital mammography is an effective modality in breast cancer detection, it has limitations in detecting dense lesions which are similar to dense tissues [1] , and further uses ionizing radiation. Therefore, ultrasound (US) imaging as a safe and versatile screening and diagnostic modality plays an important role in this regard. However, due to contamination of the US images with speckle noise, US images have low resolution and poor contrast between the target tissue and background; thus, their segmentation is currently a challenging task [2] . Researchers have utilized recent state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in order to overcome limitations in manual segmentation. Despite the success of deep learning techniques in computer vision tasks, their performance depends on the size of input data which is limited specially in medical US images. The collection and annotation of US images require considerable effort and time which attain the need to a deep learning-based strategy that can be trained on as few annotated data as possible.\nThe U-Net architecture [3] , as one of the most well-known networks for segmentation purposes, is built upon fully convolutional network. It involves several convolutional, maxpooling, and up-sampling layers. To cope with limited input data for training U-Net, researches have proposed various strategies based on data augmentation and transfer learning [2, 4, 5] .",
        "Studying the distribution of data is a foundational task in data mining and data science. Given observations from a large domain, we will often want to track the cumulative frequency distribution, to understand the behavior, or to identify anomalies. This cumulative distribution function (CDF) is also known variously as the order statistics, generalizing the median, and the quantiles. When we have a very large number of input observations, an exact characterization is excessively large, and we can be satisfied with an approximate representation, i.e., a compact function whose distance from the true CDF is bounded. Recent work has argued that, rather than a uniform error bound, it is more important to capture the detail of the tail of the input distribution.\nFaced with the problem of processing large volumes of distribution data, there have been many proposals of approximate quantile algorithms to extract the desired compact summary. These are designed to handle the input when seen as a stream of updates, or as distributed observations. Even though these various algorithms all draw on the same set of motivations, the emphasis can vary widely.",
        "When a machine learning system is used in high-risk environments, such as medicine and autonomous driving, a well-calibrated estimate of the uncertainty is necessary. A model is said to be calibrated [1] if the confidence of its predictions reflects its true probability of being correct. However, deep neural networks tend to be overconfident in their predictions [1] leading to multiple recent approaches attempting to improve their calibration [2, 3] . Furthermore, models need to be robust to shifts in the data domain, which can for example arise in the data shift between the training and deployment domains.\nTo this day, Deep Ensembles [4] outperform most other approaches. A common explanation for the improved performance is the high diversity of solutions in the ensemble [5, 6, 7] , which is mostly generated by training from different parameter initializations. While this approach works well empirically, distance in parameter space generated through training from different starting positions does not guarantee diversity in the solution space, which we refer to as functional diversity [8] . However, ensuring a diverse set of solutions in an ensemble is critical to it's performance [6, 8] .\nFollowing recent interest in the topic of diversity in neural network ensembles [6] , many publications try to implicitly generate diversity by training with different architectures [9, 10] , different data augmentations [11] and different hyperparameters [12] . However, this approach to generate diversity is sub-optimal, as it does not guarantee diversity. Additionally, choosing the right architectures and hyperparameters requires a lot of design decisions and is thereby timeconsuming. On the other side, functional diversity can be regularized explicitly [7] , an idea recently used to improve adversarial robustness in ensembles [13, 14] . Although these explicit approaches guarantee diversity of predictions, they rely on diversity measures on the original training data, which can lead to a degradation in accuracy.\nAdditionally, these approaches do not perform well in tasks of out-of-distribution detection and the naive implementation requires the simultaneous training of multiple ensemble members, which is expensive and can be prohibitive in some tasks.\nIn our experiments, we put a special focus on ensembles that share parameters between the members. While these architectures require much less computational time, the lower ratio of independent parameters per member leads to a reduction of diverse predictions [15] , which naturally lends itself to using explicit diversity maximization. For this, we use ensemble architectures with an increasing ratio of shared parameters between members and show that the effect of diversity regularization on robustness and calibration increases with a higher ratio of shared parameters.",
        "Prompt-tuning has become one of the most promising methods to adapting a pre-trained language model (PLM) to processing new downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly with only few input samples (Gu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2022) . By freezing the PLM and training with a limited set of input samples, well-optimized few-shot prompttuning achieves a comparable performance to fullmodel fine-tuning, spanning a wide spectrum of PLM sizes and NLP tasks (Gu et al., 2022; Lester et al., 2021) . The success of prompt-tuning motivates adversaries to design prompt-based Trojan (a.k.a backdoor) attacks (Xu et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2024) . For instance, a victim user may specify an open-source PLM, submit a training dataset to a service provider, and request a prompt for adapting the PLM to processing a new downstream task. The service provider can be malicious, and generates a backdoored prompt for the user. After receiving the backdoored prompt, the user may apply it to the PLM. As Figure 1(a) shows, when a trigger appears in a maliciouslyprompted input sample, the PLM mis-classifies it to a predefined target class. Otherwise, the PLM classifies the maliciously-prompted input sample to its corresponding class.\nUnfortunately, prior prompt-based backdoors (Xu et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023) cannot be implemented by few-shot prompt-tuning. Prior prompt-based backdoors require either a full-model fine-tuning (Xu et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2022) or a large training dataset (Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022) . In order to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR), BToP (Xu et al., 2022) , Notable (Mei et al., 2023) , and BadPrompt (Cai et al., 2022) have to modify a nontrivial number of PLM parameters, making their backdoor designs less stealthy and vulnerable to existing backdoor detection techniques (Feng et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023b) . Although the other prompt-based backdoor designs including PPT (Du et al., 2022) and PromptAttack (Shi et al., 2022) keep the PLM clean, and tune only a small number of prompt parameters, they require hundreds of input samples to produce a backdoored prompt that can obtain a high ASR. DecodingTrust (Wang et al., 2023) evaluates the effectiveness of attacks using hand-crafted, engineered prompts on GPT models. However, it does not address scenarios involving prompt-tuning.",
        "Formal verification is increasingly being adopted to support the development of high-quality, provably correct software. High-stakes domains, such as security-sensitive systems, cryptographic libraries, aerospace systems, and embedded software in medical devices, look to formal verification for correctness guarantees.\nFor instance, CompCert C [CompCert 2023] is a formally verified C compiler that won the ACM Software Systems award in 2021;1 in a comprehensive study [Yang et al. 2011] , researchers found no bugs in the CompCert C compiler compared to GCC [GCC 2023 ] and LLVM [LLVM 2023] toolchains. This study motivated Airbus to adopt CompCert C to help ensure safety and enhance aircraft performance [Fran\u00e7a et al. 2011 ]. The seL4 project [Klein et al. 2009 ], awarded the ACM Software System Award in 2022, resulted in a formally verified high-assurance, high-performance operating system microkernel employed to protect an autonomous helicopter against cyber-attacks [seL4 Project 2023] . In order to secure communication, both Chrome and Android use formally verified cryptographic code [Erbsen et al. 2020] . Similarly, Mozilla incorporated its verified cryptographic library for Firefox performance improvement [Jacobs and 2020 2023] .\nFormal code verification consists of two parts that go hand-in-hand: formal specification of software properties, and automated, or semi-automated, verification of those properties. Over the past 50 years, verification has had a couple of major breakthroughs, first with the development of interactive theorem provers in the 1960s [Nederpelt et al. 1994] , and then, at the turn of the millennium, with the development of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers [Barrett et al. 2021] . Unfortunately writing program properties and proofs is still a creative, manual process that requires significant effort, experience, and expertise. Formal specification languages are closer to mathematics than to regular programming languages, and necessarily incorporate subtle concepts based on classical or constructive logics. For example, writing the proofs for the seL4 microkernel was an eleven person-year effort of a group of experts [Murray et al. 2013] . Another example: the verification code of the CompCert C compiler is more than three times the size of the original compiler code itself; it took three person-years to write the complete verification code, which is approximately two lines of code in a day [Leroy 2009 ]. The fact that these systems have received important awards is a testament to how exceptional these efforts are.\nIn the universe of languages and systems for formal code verification, Dafny [Microsoft 2023a ] stands out as having made a significant effort towards usability by programmers, rather than mathematicians. Dafny is a strongly typed imperative programming language with functional and object-oriented features that supports code verification via Hoare Logic [Hoare 1969 ] assertions, preconditions, postconditions, and invariants (aka design by contract). Although algorithmic code in Dafny is similar to many other programming languages, writing the formal specifications and auxiliary verification assertions is still difficult [Faria and Abreu 2023; Noble et al. 2022] .\nOver the past year, stochastic Large Language Models (LLMs) have been revolutionizing both the software industry and research in software engineering. LLM-assisted tools such as GitHub-Copilot [Copilot 2023 ] and Amazon CodeWhisper [CodeWhisperer 2023] have been accelerating several tasks of software development such as code generation, transformation, summarization, documentation, code review, program repair and synthesis.",
        "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), is one of the most studied problems in combinatorial optimization [9] [10] . In its classic form, a salesman wants to visit each of a set of cities exactly once and return home while minimizing travel costs. Costs of traveling between cities are stored in a matrix where entry c ij indicates the cost of traveling from city i to city j. Units may be distance, time, money, etc.\nIf the underlying graph for the TSP is sparse, a complete cost matrix can still be constructed by setting c ij equal to the shortest path between city i and city j for each pair of cities. However, this has the disadvantage of turning a sparse graph G = (V, E) where the edge set E could be of size O(|V |) into a complete graph G = (V, E ), where the edge set E is O(|V | 2 ).\nRatliff and Rosenthal were the first to consider a case where the edge set is not expanded to a complete graph, but left sparse, [17] , while soon after, Fleischmann [8] and Cornu\u00e9jols, Fonlupt, and Naddef [5] examined this in a more general case, the latter giving this its name: the Graphical Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP). As a consequence, a city may be visited more than once, since there is no guarantee the underlying graph will be Hamiltonian.",
        "Quantum machine learning aims to use quantum computers to enhance the power of machine learning [1, 2] . One possible route to quantum advantage in machine learning is the use of quantum embedding kernels [3] [4] [5] [6] , where quantum computers are used to encode data in ways that are difficult for classical machine learning methods [7] [8] [9] . Noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [10, 11] may be capable of solving tasks difficult for classical computers [12, 13] and have shown promise in running proof-of-principle quantum machine learning applications [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, currently available quantum computers are at least 6 orders of magnitude orders slower than classical computers. Furthermore, running quantum computers is comparatively expensive, necessitating methods to reduce quantum resources above all else. Thus, it is important to develop better methods to run and benchmark noisy quantum computers. Here, several bottlenecks limit quantum hardware for machine learning in practice. First, the quantum cost of measuring quantum kernels with conventional methods scales quadratically with the size of the training dataset [5] . This quadratic scaling is a severe restriction, as commonly machine learning relies on large amounts of data. Second, the data has to be encoded into the quantum computer in an efficient manner and generate a useful quantum kernel.",
        "Inherent system randomness in human-driving behavior [1] creates instability in the traffic system. Shockwaves and stop-and-go have become a primary safety concern and the main cause of traffic jams [2] . Meanwhile, human drivers also want to maximize travel efficiency, such as improving average speed and minimizing headway [3] . As a result, a critical question for building an intelligent car following system is how to encourage the vehicle to travel as fast as possible while maintaining safe efficient headway to the leading vehicle and reducing shockwaves.\nAutonomous driving technology has been studied for years and started to come to reality with the development of sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The autonomous driving vehicle could potentially learn to outperform human driving in safety and comfort [3] [5] . One major benefit of Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) is that the randomness in driving behavior can be significantly reduced; thus, the whole system can be better managed by control algorithms with minimum reaction time.\nCar-following is a critical driving task. Many models have been developed to mimic human driving behavior [7] [8] . In traffic flow theory, classic Car-Following Models (CFMs) are based on physical knowledge and human behaviors, etc. 1 Tianyu Shi, Omar ElSamadisy, Baher Abdulhai are with the Department of Civil & Mineral Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. ty.shi@mail.utoronto.ca, omar.elsamadisy@mail.utoronto.ca, baher.abdulhai@utoronto.ca 2 Yifei Ai is with the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. yifei.ai@mail.utoronto.ca For example, Gipps model considers both free-flow mode (without leading vehicle) and car-following mode (with the leading vehicle) and takes the minimum velocity of them to decide whether to apply acceleration or deceleration. The following vehicle's speed is also limited by safety constraints [7] . Another well-known model is the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), which models the output acceleration based on the desired velocity, headway, relative velocity, and distance to the leading vehicle [8] .\nIn recent years, some studies proposed data driven method to train CFMs. He et al. [9] used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find the most likely behavior of vehicles in the car-following mode. Some studies also apply supervised learning. Chong et al. [10] used Neural Networks (NN) to model driver behavior regarding to longitudinal and lateral actions. Zhou et al. [11] focused on capturing and predicting traffic oscillation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [12] .\nAlthough supervised learning methods have shown very good results, it requires hand-collected microscopic carfollowing data which are rare and expensive to collect. Usually, collected data is from human drivers. Some learning methodologies such as Imitation Learning might also lead the trained models to learn some irrational behavior, such as very aggressive or very conservative behaviors from humans. Applications of RL have rapidly matured in recent research [21] . RL has successfully addressed problems such as Go [13] and Atari games [14] . In such framework, RL agents interact with the environment and observe the state and the corresponding reward. They are expected to find the optimal policies that maximize accumulated reward after training.",
        "Major financial exchanges such as NASDAQ, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and London Stock Exchange (LSE) have recently expressed interest in migrating their workloads to the cloud aiming to significantly reduce their capital expenditure, improve scalability and reduce operational burden. Major market participants of such exchanges would also benefit from such migration as they are also maintaining an expensive onpremise infrastructure for data analysis, and regression modelling to formulate their trading strategies. For cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, this is a big business opportunity. Migrating financial exchanges to the cloud is a mutually beneficial undertaking for all parties involved.\nTo this end, cloud providers and financial exchanges have announced long-term partnerships to facilitate such a move [18, 19] . Both parties perceive that this migration will be quite challenging, especially when considering all different workloads (businesses) that are currently accommodated in the exchanges' on-premise infrastructure. In this paper, we focus on \"speed race\" [9, 17] trading which is an important and highly profitable business for both the financial exchanges and the market traders. Briefly, 'speed race' trading is a form of systematic electronic trading where market participants (\"MPs\") use high-performance computers to execute strategies that aim to rapidly react and exploit new opportunities presented in the market (e.g., due to volatility, price discrepancies etc). Speed race traders, also known as High-Frequency Traders invest large amounts of money for hardware, systems and algorithmic development to achieve impressively low reaction times (\u00b5s-or even ns-scale). This trading business is only viable if market participants can compete in a fair playground guaranteed by the Central Exchange Server (CES) operators. Equality of opportunity -fairness -in such case means that all market participants must get provably simultaneous access to market data, as well as their subsequent trades must be executed in the exact order they were generated (i.e. placed in the wire).\nWith on-premise deployments financial exchanges guarantee fairness for speed race trading by guaranteeing equal bi-directional latency to the relevant market participants. Exchanges go to a great extent to ensure fairness for their colocated MP customers; it is not uncommon, for example, to use layer-1 fan-out switches for market data stream replication and equal-length cables to all co-located MPs. On the contrary, public cloud datacenter networks do not provide such guarantees as they were originally designed for a heterogeneous, multi-tenant environment, aiming to accommodate diverse workloads. Even if the MPs are located within the same cloud region as the CES, it is hard to guarantee that the latency between CES and various MPs will be the same. Copper and fiber optics cables are not necessarily of equal length, network traffic is not evenly balanced among the different paths, multiple vendors' network elements have different performance characteristics, network oversubscription is still common, and network quality of service mechanisms for concurrent workloads are only best effort.\nThis problem has recently received significant attention from the academic community. Proposed solutions aim to achieve fairness by attempting to provide equal (yet inflated) bi-directional latencies in the cloud relying on tight clock synchronization and buffering for market data delivery ( [11] ). As we explain later, such approaches are fragile because latencies in datacenter networks are not only variable, but also unbounded.",
        "Two problems that have gained considerable attention from the perspective of Parameterized Approximation [12] are the classical MaxSAT with cardinality constraint (CC-MaxSat) problem and its monotone version, the Maximum Coverage problem. In the CC-MaxSat problem, we are given a CNF-formula \u03a6 over m clauses and n variables, and a positive integer k, and that fully cover the whole universe. This negative result sets the contour for possible positive results. In particular, if we hope for an FPT algorithm that improves over a factor (1 -1 e ) then we must assume some additional structure on the input families. This automatically leads to the families wherein each set has bounded size, or each element appears in bounded sets which was considered earlier.\nSkowron and Faliszewski [27] showed that, if we are working on set families, such that each element in U appears in at most p sets, then there exists an algorithm, that given an \u03f5 > 0, runs in time ( p \u03f5 ) O(k) n O (1) and returns a subfamily F \u2032 of size k that is a (1 -\u03f5)-approximation. These kind of FPT-approximation algorithms are called FPT-approximation Schemes (FPT-ASes). For p = 2, Manurangsi [22] independently obtained a similar result. Jain et al. [18] generalized these two settings by looking at K d,d -free set systems (i.e., no d sets share d elements). They also considered K d,d -free formulas (that is, the clause-variable incidence bipartite graph of the formula excludes K d,d as an induced subgraph). They showed that for every \u03f5 > 0, there exists an algorithm for K d,d -free formulas with approximation ratio (1 -\u03f5) and running in time 2 O(( dk \u03f5 ) d ) (n + m) O (1) . For, Maximum Coverage on K d,d -free set families, they obtain an FPT-AS with running time ( dk \u03f5 ) O(dk) n O (1) . Using these results together with Theorem 1.1 we get the following.\nCorollary 1.2. Let \u03f5 > 0.",
        "The algebraic theory of block codes is remarkably elaborated and has produced sophisticated algebraic classes of codes with associated decoding algorithms. On the contrary, there exist very few algebraic general constructions of convolutional codes and most of the existing convolutional codes that have good designed distance have been found by computer search.\nSince there is no easy algebraic approach to construct a generator matrix of convolutional codes with good distance properties, several authors have extended well-known classes of block codes to the convolutional context. This idea was initiated by Massey, Costello and Justesen, who used cyclic or quasi-cyclic block codes [19, 20, 27] . Later, the same idea was further developed by many authors; see [9, 22, 32, 14] . The idea of this approach is to establish a link between the generator polynomials of the quasi-cyclic block codes and the generator matrix of convolutional codes. The most important property of this connection is that it allows to lower bound the free distance of the convolutional code by the minimum distance of the associated cyclic or quasi-cyclic block code. Within this setting, many constructions of convolutional codes with designed free distance were provided based on different classes of block codes, such as Reed-Solomon or Reed-Muller codes. Moreover, in [31] , the authors adjusted the parameters of these constructions to present the first Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) convolutional code, i.e., a convolutional code whose free distance achieves the generalized Singleton bound presented in [30] , provided that the field size is congruent to 1 modulo the length of the code. Later, other examples of MDS convolutional codes, also for restricted set of parameters, were presented; see [12, 29] . It is worth to mention also the use of circulant Cauchy matrices for the construction of MDS 2D convolutional codes in [7, 8] , that was later adapted for MDS 1D convolutional codes in [24] . All these codes are designed in such a way that they have large free distance.\nIn the context of convolutional codes, one aims to build codes that can correct as many errors as possible in different time intervals. This property is measured by the notion of column distances. Despite the fact that this notion is arguably the most fundamental distance measure for convolutional codes (see [18, pag. 162] ), very little is known on how to build convolutional codes with large column distances. Moreover, having large free distance does not guarantee to have the largest possible column distances. Codes with maximum column distances are called Maximum Distance Profile (MDP) and they were introduced in [16] and further investigated in [13] .",
        "The era of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics have been coming into play, marking a new revolution, widely referred as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0) [1] . On one hand, the physical world have been progressively evolving towards digitization thanks to the convergence of several technological advances including notably sensor technologies and ubiquitous access to the Internet. Such digital transformation therefore heralds for an always-connected world in which the digital shadow of the physical world has been practically created. On the other hand, the introduction of novel and bandwidth-hungry services such as tele-presence holography and tactile control of robotics have been accelerating in an unprecedented manner. Such two driving forces have been push-pulling the scale of challenges posed by global consumption of data and the explosive growth of Internet traffic [2] . According to the recently released report from Cisco [3] , annual global IP traffic will reach 4.8 ZB per year by 2022, exhibiting a three-fold increase over a span of 5-year and such multiplicative growth has shown no signs of stopping. In this context, optical core networks forming the backbone of Internet infrastructure have been under the critical pressure for a radical re-consideration across different phases ranging from designing, and planning to operation and management to achieve greater capital and operational efficiency. Indeed, the ultimate goal is to transfer more information at a lower cost on less spectrum resources and doing so helps to produce low-latency and high-throughput backbone networks, enabling the so-called global connectivity at scale.\nIn facing with the unprecedented traffic growth, optical transport networks have been advancing accordingly. On one hand, from the architectural perspective, core optical networks have been evolving from the opaque mode to translucent and eventually fully transparent operation. Thanks to the enormous advancements in optical components, transmission technologies and photonic switching, the vision of all-optical/transparent core networks have been experimentally and practically realized, bringing in significant savings of cost, footprint, and power by eliminating unnecessary O-E-O regenerations [4, 5, 6] . On the other hand, driven by the fact that the spectrum is limited and therefore, the capacity limit of conventional fiber might soon be reached (i.e., fiber capacity crunch), elastic optical networks technologies have been proposed and developed with the objective of using fiber capacity more efficiently. In particular, thanks to significant progress in optical transmission technologies, rate-adaptive optics has been emerging as promising solution to meet ever growing bandwidth demands and simultaneously reduce network cost. In EONs, the spectrum is divided into slices, breaking the traditional rigid frequency grid in WDM networks and hence, paving the way for adaptive spectrum provisioning tailoring to specific demand including its bandwidth requirement and transmission quality [7, 8, 9] .",
        "I MAGE classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision and machine learning, it is used to classify images into predefined class of objects. In sequential image classification tasks, images are processed as long sequences, one pixel at a time. It is different from other image classification problems because there complete image is available for processing. Deep learning techniques have been well developed and extensively used to classify images: there are several types of architecture for deep learning, such as recurrent neural network (RNN), convolution neural network (CNN) and deep neural network (DNN). Development of recurrent neural network is contributed to the authors [1] , [2] and [3] , It is widely believed that for sequential data RNNs perform better than CNN and DNN.\nIn this study, first we review the state-of-the-art network architecture for sequential image classification and in the second part we introduce a new method to construct features with the aim of reducing training time and increasing testing and training accuracy.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II contains the basics of recurrent neural network and also describe deep independent RNN and temporal convolution network.

        "AlphaZero [11] [12] [13] is a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that has achieved impressive results in two-player, zerosum games, reaching superhuman play in chess, shogi, and Go. AlphaZero simulates self-play matches with a perfect model of its environment (the rules of the game) to train a neural network that learns a value function and action selection priors over states. Each turn, the value function and priors guide a lookahead search that returns an improved policy. AlphaZero trains its neural network on the self-play matches produced under the improved policies, enabling it to improve its play via policy iteration.\nDespite its success, AlphaZero's training suffers from sample inefficiency. In 19x19 Go, AlphaZero requires hundreds of millions of training samples to attain superhuman play ( [12] , Figure 1c ). AlphaZero's sample efficiency depends upon the distribution of states visited and trained upon. Although AlphaZero has a perfect model of its environment, it cannot feasibly visit and learn the optimal value for each state. Instead, AlphaZero trains upon the states that it visits on-policy in simulated self-play matches beginning from the initial state of the game. As in other RL algorithms [14] , AlphaZero takes exploratory actions during its self-play matches so that it can train upon a variety of states, enabling it to make more informed action selections in the future. AlphaZero employs simplistic exploration mechanisms during self-play training: randomly perturbing the learned priors guiding search and stochastically selecting actions near the start of self-play matches. As a result, AlphaZero's training procedure exhibits the following limitations:\n(1) Since AlphaZero begins its self-play matches from the initial state of a game, it often transitions into a terminal state before reaching and exploring states deeper in the game tree.\nIn addition, AlphaZero only samples actions over the first few moves of a self-play match, further limiting exploration deeper in the game tree. (2) AlphaZero's exploration mechanisms cause it to train under weaker, exploratory policies, slowing policy iteration. (3) AlphaZero only produces a single, noisy value target from a full self-play match, slowing value training. We hypothesized that AlphaZero could address these limitations, and learn with greater sample efficiency, with a more effective search control strategy. Sutton and Barto define search control as \"the process that selects the starting states and actions for the simulated experiences generated by the model\" [14] . In AlphaZero, this would amount to strategically choosing the starting state of its simulated trajectories.",
        "The selectivity of a selection query on a set of objects in a database is the probability of a random object in the database satisfying the query predicate. A key step in query optimization, selectivity estimation is used by databases for estimating costs of alternative query processing plans and picking the best one. Consequently, selectivity estimation has been studied extensively in the last few decades [30, 35, 42, 43, 45] . Historically, selectivity estimation has been data-driven. These approaches construct, or dynamically maintain, a small-size synopsis of the data distribution using histograms or random samples that minimize estimation error. While these methods work well in low dimensions, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. As a result, interest in learning-based methods for selectivity estimation has been growing over the years [23, 31, 32, 33, 37, 39] . Many different methods have been proposed that work with the data distribution, observed selectivities from query workloads, or a combination of both. At a high-level, many of these techniques build a model of the underlying data distribution and use it to answer queries. While they work very well in practice, often outperforming their traditional counterparts, a theoretical understanding of this line of work is missing. This leads to the natural question, whether selectivity can be learned efficiently from a small sample of query selectivities alone, without access to the data distribution. Hu et al. [26] formalize the learnability of the selectivity estimation problem in this setting. They use the agnostic-learning framework [24] , an extension of the classical PAC learning framework for real-valued functions, where one is given a set of sample queries from a fixed query distribution and their respective selectivities (the training set), and the goal is to efficiently construct a data distribution so that the selectivity of a new query from the same query distribution can be answered with high accuracy. They show that for a wide class of range queries, the selectivity query can be learned within error \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1) with probability at least 1 -\u03b4 using a training set of size \u03b5 -O(1) log \u03b4 -1 , where the exponent of \u03b5 depends on the query type; see [26] for a precise statement of their results. Informally, learnability implies that performance of a model on the training set generalizes to unseen queries from the same distribution. This reduces the task of learning to finding a (model of the) data distribution that best fits the training data i.e. Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Although Hu et al. [26] prove a sharp bound on the sample complexity, their algorithm for ERM takes prohibitively long and produces a data distribution of large size. They also present fast heuristics to construct small-size data distributions, but they do not provide any guarantee on the performance with respect to the best data distribution fitting the training set. This raises the question of how to develop a provably efficient and effective algorithm for constructing the best data distribution (in a given family) from a training set.\nNote that the size of the distribution computed by [26] , can further be reduced to O(\u03b5 -2 ) by choosing an \u03b5-approximation, with an increase of \u03b5 in the error; see [22] and Section 3 below.",
        "With emerging delay-sensitive applications, the timely update of the packet-based information is becoming increasingly more important. For instance, in status update systems such as in family care, security alert and environment monitoring scenarios, keeping system information fresh is extremely critical and essential [1] . Age of information (AoI) has been proposed to measure the freshness of the status information in [2] . Specifically, AoI is defined as the time that has elapsed since the generation of last successfully received system information.\nRecently, AoI has attracted much interest from the academia [3]- [13] . For instance, general update policies such as zerowait policy have been studied in [3] , where an efficient optimal update mechanism has been designed. Under the assumption of using \"generate-at-will\" model, by employing the queueing theory, how the packets should be managed in the buffer aided scheme has been addressed in [4] . The authors mainly concentrated on the system performance under M/M/1 and M/M/1/2 queuing systems with first-come-first-served (FCFS) policies. Poisson arrival processes with last-generated-firstserved (LGFS) strategy have been considered in [5] , as an extension from the last-come-first-served (LCFS) system. The limited nature of the transmission power or the total energy in communication systems has necessitated the age minimization problems to be addressed under energy constraints. For in-stance, considering energy harvesting devices and batteries, the authors have proposed an energy-aware adaptive status update policy for the information refresh mechanism in [6] . The authors in [7] have considered an optimal sensing scheduling policy for energy harvesting sensing system and discussed the system performance with finite and infinite battery sizes separately. Also, the performance of the proposed policy was shown to match the theoretical bounds. The integer battery policies were generalized in [8] , and the threshold polices have been characterized.",
        "In recent years deep learning has made major advances in computer vision areas such as image recognition, video object detection and tracking. A deep neural network needs a large amount of labeled data to fit its parameters whereas it is laborious to label so many examples by human annotators. Thus the problem of learning with few labeled samples called few-shot learning has been paid more and more attention. Fewshot learning is described as a classification task set in N -way and k -shot, which means to distinguish N categories, each of which has k (quite small) labeled samples. The model predict classes for new examples only depending on k labeled data. The annotated data is called the support set, and the new data belonging to the N categories is called query set.\nPeople have proposed varieties of few-shot methods, all of which rely on meta-training assisted with base classes. The universal approach is to use the base classes to construct fake few-shot tasks for training the network first, with the purpose of enabling the network an ability to accomplish real fewshot tasks through simulating the process of carrying out the fake tasks. This is called the meta-training stage with tasks as samples. Next, use the trained network to complete real few-shot tasks of novel classes, and calculate the classification accuracy on the query set in the tasks to evaluate the algorithm, which is usually called the meta-testing. The whole procedure is shown in Fig. 1 .\nFew-shot learning algorithms could be classified into three categories. The first [1] - [4] is based on metric learning, which consists of three steps of feature extraction, distance measure, Fig. 1 . The universal method used in supervised few-shot learning, which consists of meta-training and meta-testing. In the meta-training, the training sample is actually a mimic few-shot task comprised of some labeled data chosen from base classes. And in the meta-testing the model will solve a real task with few labeled data and an unlabeled query set chosen from novel classes. We show a model trained for solving 3-way 1-shot tasks in this figure . and prediction, relying on effective metric design and reducing the cross entropy loss in meta training to improve classification accuracy. The second are the teacher-student network based methods including [5] - [8] .",
        "The construction industry is still a laborintensive industry, with most management and interventions of on-site activities relying on manual judgments [1] , which makes construction site management difficult and inefficient. Although the emergence of high-resolution monitoring cameras makes remote and dynamic monitoring of the construction site possible, it still requires a lot of manual intervention [2] . The rapid development of computer vision technology makes it possible to automate tasks that cannot be completed by the human vision system, effectively improving safety and production efficiency [3] . The importance of cameras in the field of construction management has become increasingly prominent, and practitioners have begun to embrace changes brought by automated applications powered by computer vision [4] . For example, video surveillance can identify workers' unsafe behaviors and risks of construction [5] , where computer vision technology is used to identify workers who do not wear personal protective equipment [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The use of computer vision technology in construction automation has thus attracted wide attention from academia and industry.\nIn recent years, deep learning object detection algorithm has developed rapidly, and many object detection algorithms have emerged. The detection speed and accuracy have been greatly improved. Under the appropriate application scenarios, the recognition accuracy can reach 98% or even higher. At the same time, the detection accuracy of the computer vision technology based on deep learning has great advantages over the traditional image processing and recognition methods [12] , and it is far superior to the traditional image processing methods in terms of detection speed, algorithm robustness and feature extraction without manual design. Therefore, the introduction of the deep learning method into object detection in construction site management will be a new direction [13] . However, deep learning algorithms are data-hungry, which means the application of deep learning object detection on construction site requires a specific image dataset in the construction field. Construction is a highly professional process with unique processes that brings challenges to both the collection and annotation of the images, which is the reason that well-annotated image sets for the construction industry are hardly seen in popular image sets such as the ImageNet.\nIn order to promote the research of object detection in the construction industry, it is necessary to build a large-scale image dataset containing specific objects from the construction site (i.e., workers, materials, machines, layouts). The existing construction site image dataset is relatively small and has fewer categories, concentrating on people, personal protective equipment (PPE), and some machines. This is because: (1) The image of the construction site is more challenging to obtain than that of ordinary objects. Due to security concerns, the construction site is generally not open to the public. Moreover, the available online resources of construction site images are less common than daily objects and have high repeatability. (2) It is difficult to obtain data from different perspectives of objects on construction sites by using the conventional monocular camera installed on-site, which is easy to cause overfitting of object detection model. (3) The environment of the site is usually disorderly and numerous, and the difficulty and cost of annotation are high.",
        "Recent advances in Language Models (LMs) [10, 45, 48, 56] and tool use [1, 42, 61] have led to the development of agents such as WebGPT [42] , AutoGPT [57] and ChatGPT Plugins [46] that operate semi-autonomously in the real-world. While these approaches have the potential to unlock more powerful capabilities for LMs, transitioning from LMs that interact with humans through text, to agents that act in the real world using tools accentuates the risks accompanying their broader deployment.\nThe failure of LM agents to follow instructions can lead to a new and diverse array of serious risks, ranging from financial loss, such as when conducting transactions with banking tools, to substantial property damage or even life-threatening dangers, when operating robots that interact with the physical environment. Given the potentially severe real-world consequences of such failures, it is essential to identify even low-probability risks associated with LM agents prior to deployment. However, identifying the risks associated with LM agents is challenging due to the long-tail, open-ended nature of these risks and the substantial engineering effort required for testing. Typically, human experts implement specific tools, set up a sandbox tailored for designated test cases, and examine agent executions for potential failures. Such a labor-intensive procedure constrains the test space, making it difficult to scale up the risk assessment to a wide range of tools and scenarios and to identify long-tail risks.\nTo tackle these obstacles, we take inspiration from the extensive use of simulator-based testing in highstakes domains such as autonomous driving [17] , and introduce ToolEmu (Fig. 1 ), an LM-based tool emulation framework designed to examine LM agents across a diverse set of tools, identify realistic failures in long-tail scenarios, and facilitate the development of safer agents with an automatic evaluator.\nThe core of our framework is the use of an LM to emulate the tools and their execution sandboxes. In contrast to typical emulated environments that are programmatically and statically established, we \u2714 Figure 1 : Overview of ToolEmu. Our framework assists in rapidly identifying realistic failures of LM agents across various scenarios within an LM-emulated environment and facilitates the development of safer LM agents with LM-automated evaluations. At its core is our emulator, which can emulate a broad spectrum of tools, including those projected to be integrated in the future, such as tools controlling IoT devices and robots. Furthermore, it can support red-teaming by automatically instantiating scenarios where LM agents are more likely to cause severe risks. For enhanced emulation and evaluation, the emulator and evaluator utilize information from designated test cases, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . utilize recent advances in LMs (e.g., GPT-4 [45] ) that enable us to emulate tool execution using only tool specifications and tool inputs, rather than requiring a specific implementation of each tool and its execution environment.",
        "The deployment of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) within the US National Airspace has seen dramatic growth with applications such as remote sensing, package delivery, and emergency response [4, 27, 58] . These operations are conducted in airspace shared with other sUASs' and constrained by no-fly zones such as airports, national parks, and schools. The rapid escalation in sUAS numbers has been accompanied by a corresponding surge in reported incidents, often attributed to issues such as hardware or software malfunctions, human errors, including reckless disregard for rules and regulations, or external factors such as radio interference and adverse weather conditions [4, 28] . Consequently, sUAS operators must seek permission to fly in all controlled airspace. For example, in the USA, Remote Pilots In Command (RPICs) must currently request flight permission through the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC), which grants access to airspace below 400 feet AGL (above ground level), provides awareness for where RPICs can and cannot fly, and provides visibility to air traffic controllers into where sUAS are currently operating [3] . The current system does not take into consideration specific flight details, environmental factors, drone characteristics, or pilot competencies.\nTo this end, a unified ecosystem called the UAS Traffic Management System (UTM) is being developed by the FAA, with research support from NASA, to coordinate large numbers of sUAS in shared low-altitude airspace [52] . The UTM system relies on the digital exchange of planned flight information for each RPIC. An sUAS's capability to successfully and safely execute a mission is influenced by factors such as its inherent features (e.g., aircraft weight, size, and onboard sensors, etc.), its suitability for flight, operating environment (weather conditions, population density, the complexity of airspace, etc.) the planned flight characteristics, and the human operator (track record, license, certification per FAA regulation -referred to as Part 107 in the USA, and skills, etc.) [5, 6] . While currently still under development, the UTM would mandate that operators submit a Performance Authorization Request (PAR) detailing how the sUAS's ground assets, services, personnel, and maintenance protocols will ensure safe operation for the flight duration. The software system to be developed for the UTM is safety-critical in that its decisions can contribute to the safety of an airspace or can compromise its safety [38] . Moreover, some sUAS operations undertaken in an airspace are themselves safety-critical, such as rescue operations, and could be jeopardized or delayed by an injudicious or unintended decision by the software.\nEvaluating the PAR is currently a manual, labor-intensive process and, therefore, lacks scalability and is prone to human error.",
        "Semantic layout manipulation refers to the task of editing an image by modifying its semantic label map, i.e., changing the semantic layout or inserting/erasing objects as illustrated in Fig. 1 . It has many practical image editing applications such as photoediting [1] , image retargeting [2] , restoration [3] , composition [4] and image melding [5] , but is relatively under-explored due to the challenges of predicting complex, non-rigid spatial deformations and the domain gap between the input image and the target semantic layout. Essentially, developing an effective method to transfer visual patterns from the input image to the target semantic layout is the key to solving the problem.\nEarly works [2] , [6] , [7] , [8] on image synthesis allow users to mark semantic regions for guided image manipulation. These methods utilize non-parametric modeling of patches [6] , [8] or patch-based copy-pasting strategies [2] , [5] , [7] , [9] , [10] to generate new images. They work well for generating stationary textures or repeating structures, but cannot hallucinate new semantic structures.\nRecently, with the development of deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), structureguided image manipulation has made remarkable progresses. In particular, Champandard et al. [12] design a semantic-aware loss on a pretrained classifier [13] for semantic-guided artwork generation. Zhu et al. [14] optimize the latent code of generative model for layout-constrained image generation. More recently, guided inpainting methods [15] , [16] , [17] are proposed to manipulate nature images. Specifically, guided inpainting approaches mask out some regions from images and hallucinate new pixels to Fig. 1 . Semantic layout manipulation. Given an input image (1st column) and a semantic label map (3rd column) manipulated from an existing semantic map (2nd column), our network generates manipulated images (last column) that conform to the semantic layout guidance. The images are generated at resolution 512 \u00d7 512. It is worth noting that rather than relying on the ground-truth layout for manipulation, our model utilizes a semantic parser [11] to generate layouts from input images.\nencourage the inpainting results to follow the edge scribbles provided by users. To achieve semantic layout manipulation, a recent work [3] extends inpainting networks by including semantic label maps in the missing region as inputs. Despite showing promising results, [3] is inherently limited in that 1) it discards pixels inside the mask region which may contain important visual details useful for manipulation tasks, and 2) it lacks the spatial alignment mechanism to handle drastic layout change.\nOn the other hand, methods utilizing attention-based warp-ing [18] , [19] have shown promising results for global referencebased layout editing. Specifically, Zhang et al. [18] introduce a cross-domain correspondence network to warp input images to desired layouts. Zheng et al. [19] propose a spatial-channel attention method to align multi-scale visual features to a new layout. Due to explicit warping, they can handle dramatic layout changes.",
        "More recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and their variants have successfully extended convolution and pooling operation to graphs and achieved good performance in many fields such as computer vision, recommendation systems and natural language processing [1] . Currently, spatial-based GCNs, such as GCN [2] , GraphSAGE [3] and GraphSAINT [4] , have gradually replaced spectralbased GCNs in practice due to their efficiency and flexibility. In order to solve the scalability problem of GCNs, researchers have proposed two kinds of minibatch training algorithms: sampling-based [3, 4, 5] and clustering-based [6] , to extend GCNs to large-scale graphs. Tasks in graph representation learning can be divided into three categories: node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. The node classification task has become one of the most popular benchmarks in GCNs due to its intuitiveness and simplicity.\nMuch of the work has aimed at the practice of GCNs, e.g., Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) [7] , which has greatly promoted the development of GCNs.\nBefore the release of OGB datasets and its leaderboard, GCNs have not had a unified and universally-followed experimental protocol. Different studies have used different dataset splitters and evaluators, which have a negative impact on the fairness of different experiments [8, 9] . Moreover, small graph datasets used in the early days, such as Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed, are far away from the real-world graphs, making it difficult to transfer some tricks to large-scale and real-world graphs. The above factors have led to the tricks of GCNs not receiving enough attention in the early research. Some tricks are either simply mentioned in the literature or only visible in the source code. Fortunately, since the release of OGB datasets and its leaderboard, the importance of tricks has gradually emerged under relatively fair evaluation standards and real-world graphs. Besides, the gains brought by tricks have sometimes exceeded the gains brought by model architecture improvement. However, no one has summarized the tricks of GCNs, which are also not complete so far. The inner relationships between these tricks are not clear, which bring difficulties to the application and further development.\nPresent work. Firstly, we review the mini-batch training process and the existing effective tricks of GCNs which can often make training faster and better for node classification tasks. Based on this, we propose two noval tricks for node classification tasks: GCN res Framework and Embedding Usage.",
        "Satellite communication has drawn significant attention in the past decade in both academia and industries owing to its ability to provide ubiquitous wireless coverage and continuous service, especially in areas where the terrestrial coverage of cellular network is not available [1] . In terms of orbital height, satellites can be broadly classified into three categories, geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites, medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites, and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Although supporting smaller coverage compared to GEO and MEO satellites, LEO satellites bring appealing advantages for boosting communication performance, such as reduced over-the-air delay and path loss resulting from the shorter link distance, and lower deployment cost. Therefore, megaconstellation LEO satellite system has emerged as a promising technology in achieving seamless communication service across the globe with fertile business opportunities.\nTo capitalize the growing opportunities, there has been an upsurge of proposals put forward by different companies about deploying LEO satellite mega-constellations, e.g., OneWeb, Kuiper and Starlink, to provide global broadband access. Besides, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) has joint forces to devote standardization efforts to support the operation of fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) in non-terrestrial network (NTN) using satellite access. In Release 15, deployment scenarios, channel models and key impacted areas in NR were identified [2] . Further features and modifications for adapting NR in NTN were studied in Release 16 [3] . In Releases 17 and 18, 3GPP continues the standardization effort to address challenges in the operation of NR-based protocols with NTN, and further investigates the NTN-specific techniques for performance enhancement.\nOn the other hand, beam hopping is envisioned as a flexible technique in satellite communication to meet the time-varying traffic demands of user equipment (UEs) on the ground with reduced payload weight and financial cost. It offers a new design degree of freedom for communication performance improvement via intelligently illuminating a portion of the satellite coverage area at each snapshot [4] . Specifically, in addition to dynamically adjusting satellite resources, beam hopping can alleviate the inter-beam interference via scheduling beams such that a full bandwidth reuse becomes possible with a higher capacity. Therefore, significant endeavors have been devoted to exploiting and evaluating the benefits brought by beam hopping in satellite communication. In [5] , DVB-S2X standard defined three frame structures with variable frame length and dummy frame, e.g., Format 5-7, to support beam hopping. In [6] , the potential of beam hopping was illustrated on top of a system-level simulator, where a GEO satellite is employed to illuminate 14 beams. A cooperative multiagent deep reinforcement learning framework was proposed in [7] for the joint optimization of beam hopping pattern and bandwidth allocation to match the time-varying traffic demand.",
        "It is well known that LCH equation is one of the phase field models, and the history of the phase field model can be traced back to a century ago which has been applied in many fields [3, 4, 9, 12, 15, 25, 32, 36, 37] . The Cahn-Hilliard-type models are effective numerical tools for simulating interface motions between various materials [8, 10, 11, 24, 26, 27, 31, 34, 41] . The LCH is the result of the variation of the energy functional in Sobolev space H -1 . Furthermore, the LCH equation can be regarded as an approximation of the NCH model in which the nonlocal convolution potential is replaced by the differential term [17, 18] . For the nonlocal models, much has been done in mathematical analysis. Bates and Han [6, 7] analyzed the well-posedness of equations with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Guan et al. pointed out in [21] that the existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions of equations can be proved by a similar technique. In order to develop a general framework for nonlocal equations, Du et al. [13] analyzed a class of nonlocal spread problems with volumetric constraint boundary conditions.\nAs the NCH equation gets more and more attention and is applied in many fields from physics, material science to finance and image processing [2, 11, 16, 33, 43] , so it is necessary to construct some effective methods for solving the NCH equation. Due to the functional variation approach used in the modeling process, the exact solution of the phase field follows the energy dissipation law, which demonstrates the thermodynamic consistency in physics and well-posedness in mathematics. Therefore, the main challenge of numerical simulation for the NCH equation is to design appropriate method to discrete nonlinear and nonlocal terms while maintaining the energy stability at the discrete level. In addition, if the numerical energy stability has no restriction with respect to the time step, it is usually called unconditional energy stability [10] . The significance of energy stability is not only important for long time accurate numerical simulation of phase field models, but also provides flexibility for dealing with stiffness problems. This property provides a lot of theoretical and practical support for efficient numerical analysis and reliable computer simulation, and is widely used in various numerical schemes of classical phase field models, such as convex splitting schemes [20, 21] , stabilized schemes [39, 42] , the invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) [43] , the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) methods [29] , the various variants of SAV [22, 28, 30] and so on. It is also worth studying whether these various effective numerical approaches can be applied to nonlocal phase field model due to the lack of high-order diffusion term [14, 20] .\nMoreover, there is no doubt that, under certain precision requirements, if the expected time step is as large as possible, the high-order scheme in time is better than the lower-order scheme. This fact prompted us to develop high-order schemes, there are some existing woks, such as the high-order SAV-RK (Runge-Kutta) [1, 19] , SAV-GL (general linear time discretization) [40] , implicit-explicit BDFk SAV [23] . All of these methods can be used to construct high-order schemes for numerical simulation of phase field models.\nThe purpose of this paper is to establish the high-order linear schemes (in time) for the NCH equation and prove the unconditional energy stability of the semi-discrete level, which can be naturally extended to the fully discrete setting. We adopt the exponential semi-implicit scalar auxiliary variable (ESI-SAV) approach [30] , which is a novel method and has been successfully applied to solve some gradient flow and non-gradient but dissipative system.",
        "The toll of the drug overdose epidemic in the United States is staggering; more than one hundred thousand people lost their life from a drug overdose in 2021 alone [1] . Opioids have been a major driver of the epidemic, and opioid overdose mortality in the U.S. has grown exponentially since 1979 [2] . Furthermore, the rate of nonfatal drug overdose Emergency Medical Services (EMS) encounters involving opioids nearly doubled from January 2018 to March 2022 [3] . Evidence suggests that state-level efforts have been moderately successful in reducing misuse of prescription opioids [4] , but such policies may have unintentionally increased opioid mortality by indirectly incentivizing illicit usage [5] . For every fatal drug overdose there are many more nonfatal overdoses, and EMS data uniquely provide information on where nonfatal overdoses occur, as well as details on patient residence. This information can be used for understanding how far from a person's place of residence they experienced an overdose, hereafter called a journey to overdose.\nNetwork analysis has been proven to be useful for studying multiple types of public health questions, including disease transmission, diffusion of health-related behavior and information, and social support networks, which are relevant to opioid overdose [6, 7, 8] . In the context of the opioid overdose crisis, social network analysis of Appalachians found that over half the individuals in their data set had a first-degree relationship with someone who experienced an opioid overdose, and this proportion was higher near city centers [9] . It was also found that measures of network centrality and prominence can elucidate illicit opioid-seeking behavior [10, 11] .\nTo the best of our knowledge, Oser et al. applied the concept of geographical discordance to drug overdoses for the first time [12] . They found that people who use drugs who traveled to counties other than those of their residences for substance abuse treatment are more likely to relapse with prescription opioids. They also found that geographically discordant treatment efforts (i.e., when those in treatment obtain it in a county other than that of their residence) are more common among rural populations than suburban or urban ones.

        "In recent years, the ability of machines to solve increasingly more complex tasks has grown exponentially (Sejnowski, 2018) . The availability of learning algorithms that deal with tasks such as facial and voice recognition, automatic driving, and fraud detection makes the various applications of machine learning a hot topic not just in the specialised literature but also in the media outlets. Since many decades, computer scientists have been using algorithms that automatically update their course of action to better their performance. Already in the 1950's, Arthur Samuel developed a program to play checkers that improved its performance by learning from its previous moves. The term \"machine learning\" (ML) is often said to have originated in that context. Since then, major technological advances in data storage, data transfer, and data processing have paved the way for learning algorithms to start playing a crucial role in our everyday life.\nNowadays, the usage of ML has become a valuable tool for enterprises' management to predict key performance indicators and thus to support corporate decisionmaking across the value chain including the appointment of directors (Erel et al., 2018) , the prediction of product sales (Bajari et al., 2019) , and employees' turnover (Ajit, 2016; Saradhi and Palshikar, 2011) . Using data which emerges as a byproduct of economic activity has a positive impact on firms' growth (Farboodi et al., 2019) and strong data analytic capabilities leverage corporate performance (Mikalef et al., 2019) . Simultaneously, publicly accessible data sources that cover information across firms, industries and countries, open the door for analysts and policy makers to study firm dynamics on a broader scale such as the fate of start-ups (Guerzoni et al., 2019) , product success (Munos et al., 2020) , firm growth (Weinblat, 2018) , and bankruptcy (Bargagli-Stoffi et al., 2020c) .\nMost ML methods can be divided in two main branches: (i) unsupervised learning (UL) and (ii) supervised learning (SL) models. UL refers to those techniques used to draw inferences from data sets consisting of input data without labelled responses. These algorithms are used to perform tasks such as clustering and pattern mining.",
        "Highly detailed maps of the road infrastructure are considered a crucial enabler for autonomous vehicles and most autonomous driving systems make extensive use of maps to aid navigation and action planning. Detailed semantic maps offer a dramatically improved understanding of the vehicle environment by augmenting the available onboard sensor data with information about road area, traffic signs, road markings, obstacles and more. This is particularly valuable in challenging situations such as dense urban traffic, heavily occluded scenes as well as at large distances, where sensor performance typically degrades. Commercial mapping providers are developing increasingly detailed 3D highdefinition maps for autonomous vehicles with rich semantic information that are highly abstracted from underlying sensor data, which allow for lightweight storage, easy interpretation and sharing across different vendors.\nTo exploit the map knowledge, a precise localization within the map is of tremendous importance and should work reliably in any condition including GPS-denied areas or difficult urban regions. Localization is a fundamental problem in robotics and has been addressed with visual localization methods in the past, which typically rely on specific handcrafted or learned features as localization landmarks. In many real-world applications including autonomous vehicles however, the maps do not contain landmarks designed for the task of localization, because they have been created with different methods or sensors, or are provided by third parties. A promising way to overcome the lack of specific localization landmarks is to directly use the semantic and geometric information, which are provided for higher-level tasks, also for localization purposes. In addition to enable localization in various existing and future map formats, using semantic information as localization landmarks yields many other appealing properties. Semantic information can easily be obtained from sensor data, since segmentation networks are available for different sensor modalities and are often readily available in the system pipeline as they are used for other perception tasks. Furthermore, semantics is largely invariant to different environmental conditions, such as weather or season, and across different sensor modalities.\nOur localization approach is inspired by the success of direct image alignment methods for odometry estimation [1] and map-relative tracking [2] . The fundamental idea driving our method is to recover a precise vehicle pose with respect to the map by aligning camera frames to virtual map views rendered from the semantic map. Starting from an initial pose estimate obtained from e.g. GPS or place recognition, our system directly optimizes for the vehicle pose, which enables localization in real-time.",
        "Quasi-Direct Drive Actuators (QDDs) have enabled high-speed and robust locomotion in legged robots by combining a powerful motor with a low-ratio transmission to minimize output mechanical impedance (OMI) and mass while meeting torque and power requirements. Designers must carefully balance competing performance properties when selecting motors to make successful QDDs for legged locomotion.\nLegged robotic systems apply large ground reaction forces (GRFs) to execute demanding actions, such as high-speed galloping, rapid direction changes, and jumps. These actions impose large torque requirements for actuators. Because actuators make up a significant portion of total robot mass, they should be as",
        "Over the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in efforts to develop efficient uncertainty quantification approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with random inputs. Typically, these random inputs arise from a lack of precise measurements or a limited understanding of realistic model parameters, such as permeability coefficients in diffusion problems and refraction coefficients in acoustic problems [38, 11, 12] .\nDesigning a surrogate model or calculating statistics (such as mean and variance of the solution) for partial differential equations (PDEs) with random inputs is of great interest, especially when the inputs are high-dimensional. To achieve this, extensive efforts have been made. The Monte Carlo method (MCM) and its variants are among the direct methods for computing the mean and variance [5, 13] . In MCM, numerous sample points of the random inputs are generated based on their probability density functions. For each sample point, the corresponding deterministic problem can be solved using existing numerical methods. The statistics of the stochastic solution can then be estimated by aggregating the results of these deterministic solutions. While MCM is easy to implement, it converges slowly and typically requires a large number of sample points. Additionally, it does not provide a surrogate model directly, which limits its applications.\nTo enhance efficiency, the stochastic collocation method (SCM) and the stochastic Galerkin method (SGM) have been developed. Both the SCM and the SGM are typically more efficient than the MCM for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with moderate dimensional random inputs [37, 38, 39, 40, 32, 41] . To further accelerate the SCM and the SGM, various of methods such as the reduced basis collocation method [10] , the dynamically orthogonal approximation [6, 7, 24] , the reduced basis solver based on low-rank approximation [27] and the preconditioned low-rank projection methods [19, 20] are actively studied.",

Pour pallier \u00e0 cette faiblesse, le domaine de la planification dans l'incertain [2] s'est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9, proposant d'int\u00e9grer des actions \u00e0 effet probabiliste puis des fonctions d'utilit\u00e9 additives sur les buts, conduisant \u00e0 une famille d'approches pour la planification bas\u00e9es sur la th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9cision [3] et utilisant des langages de repr\u00e9sentation traditionnellement connus en intelligence artificielle: logique, contraintes ou r\u00e9seaux bay\u00e9siens. L'utilisation de ces langages de repr\u00e9sentation a fait exploser une grande complexit\u00e9 dans les algorithmes de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration des plans dont la r\u00e9solution est devenue un d\u00e9fi pour la communaut\u00e9 de l'intelligence artificielle. C'est ainsi que l'id\u00e9e de l'utilisation des syst\u00e8mes multi agents a germ\u00e9 chez les chercheurs.\nEn effet, l'extension de la planification dans le cadre des syst\u00e8mes multi-agent a aboutit \u00e0 la planification distribu\u00e9e [4] , [11] dans laquelle le domaine de planification est r\u00e9parti sur un ensemble d'agents. Ces agents peuvent \u00eatre coop\u00e9ratifs dans le sens o\u00f9 ils ont un objectif global commun et des capacit\u00e9s compl\u00e9mentaires pour le r\u00e9aliser ou individualistes dans le sens o\u00f9 ils ont des objectifs individuels dont ils sont capables d'assurer la r\u00e9alisation sans aide externe. Dans les deux cas les agents doivent \u00eatre capables de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des plans qui permettent la r\u00e9alisation soit des sous-objectifs n\u00e9cessaires pour un objectif global soit des objectifs individuels. Dans la litt\u00e9rature, il existe quelques travaux sur planification distribu\u00e9e. Nous citons, entre autres [177] , [178] , [179] , [180] .\nLe paradigme agent rev\u00eat de plus en plus d'importance pour sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 aborder les syst\u00e8mes complexes caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s par l'ind\u00e9terminisme, l'\u00e9mergence et l'\u00e9volution impr\u00e9dictible. Il est tr\u00e8s efficace pour g\u00e9rer la nature h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8ne des composantes d'un syst\u00e8me, pour mod\u00e9liser les interactions entre les composantes de ce dernier et pour tenter de comprendre les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes \u00e9mergents qui en d\u00e9coulent. Ceci est li\u00e9 au fait que l'agent poss\u00e8de un comportement, caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 principalement par quatre propri\u00e9t\u00e9s [5] :\n-Autonomie ou proactivit\u00e9 : capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 agir sans intervention ext\u00e9rieure, prise d'initiative.\n-Sensibilit\u00e9 : capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 percevoir l'environnement ou les autres agents.\n-Localit\u00e9 : limitation de la perception et des actions.\n-Flexibilit\u00e9 : r\u00e9action aux changements per\u00e7us.\nEn effet, l'agent ne se limite pas seulement \u00e0 r\u00e9agir aux invocations de m\u00e9thodes sp\u00e9cifiques, comme il est souvent le cas dans le paradigme objet, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 tout autre changement observable dans son environnement. La prise en compte de ces changements se traduit automatiquement par un ensemble d'actions nouvelles que l'agent doit ex\u00e9cuter. La d\u00e9termination de ces actions d\u00e9pend de la nature de l'agent [6] . En effet si, par exemple, l'agent est rationnel, les actions \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer ne doivent pas \u00eatre en opposition avec la fonction d'utilit\u00e9 de l'agent, si l'agent est avec but, ces actions ne doivent pas \u00eatre en opposition avec le but de l'agent, si l'agent est r\u00e9actif avec mod\u00e8le, ces actions sont pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par un ensemble de r\u00e8gles, etc.\nLe comportement de l'agent est ainsi source d'avantages mais les actions nouvelles \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter par l'agent, afin de prendre en consid\u00e9ration les changements impr\u00e9dictibles qui caract\u00e9risent son environnement, peuvent cr\u00e9er un probl\u00e8me lors de la planification distribu\u00e9e. En effet dans la planification classique, l'ensemble des actions \u00e0 planifier est d\u00e9fini auparavant et ne subit aucun changement assurant ainsi, une fiabilit\u00e9 du plan g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de son ex\u00e9cution. Par contre dans la planification distribu\u00e9e, chaque agent peut avoir des changements dans son ensemble d'actions \u00e0 planifier, suite aux changements impr\u00e9dictibles de son environnement. En effet \u00e0 cause des changements survenus sur l'ensemble des actions, le plan que l'agent \u00e9tait entrain d'ex\u00e9cuter devient obsol\u00e8te car il ne prend pas en consid\u00e9ration les nouvelles actions \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter par l'agent, afin de prendre en consid\u00e9ration les changements impr\u00e9dictibles de son environnement. L'agent se trouve par cons\u00e9quent, contraint de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un nouveau plan. De ce fait, la r\u00e9flexion vers une approche de planification dynamique permet de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer, \u00e0 tout moment et au fur et \u00e0 mesure des changements, de nouveaux plans pour prendre en consid\u00e9ration les nouvelles actions s'impose d'elle-m\u00eame.",
        "Neural network classifiers are vulnerable to designed training samples added in the training set or the testing data (Biggio, Nelson, and Laskov 2012; Szegedy et al. 2014 ). Manipulating 1% of the dataset can cause the target image to be misclassified at a 90% success rate (Huang et al. 2020) . Inserting less than 5% poisoned training samples can make the classifier's feature selection almost randomly (Xiao et al. 2015) . There exists many kinds of data poisoning attacks (Chen et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2018; Turner, Tsipras, and Madry 2018; Zhao et al. 2020; Turner, Tsipras, and Madry 2019; Ji, Zhang, and Wang 2017; Yao et al. 2019b; Zhang et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2019a ). Therefore, it is urgent to develop defenses against data poisoning attacks. Many heuristic defenses have been proposed (Wang et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019; Gao et al. 2019; Tran, Li, and Madry 2018; Liu et al. 2019; Qiao, Yang, and Li 2019; Steinhardt, Koh, and Liang 2017) against data poisoning attacks, but the security level of those defenses is hard to measure. To achieve certified robustness, various certified defenses have been proposed, including randomized smoothing based defenses (Wang et al. 2020; Rosenfeld et al. 2020; Jia, Cao, and Gong 2020) , loss based defenses (Steinhardt, Koh, and Liang 2017) and differential privacy based defenses (Ma, Zhu, and Hsu 2019) .",
        "While the reliability of autonomous vehicles continues to improve, operating in rain and snow remains a challenge. Most autonomous driving systems rely primarily on a combination of cameras and lidar for perception, with radar sensors taking a back-seat role [13] . Cen and Newman [15] presented a successful application of a scanning radar sensor to largescale outdoor ego-motion estimation. Their work has inspired a resurgence of research into radar-based perception and navigation systems. Compared to lidar, radar is more robust to precipitation due to its longer wavelength. For this reason, radar may be a key to enabling self-driving vehicles to operate in adverse weather. The ultimate goal of this research is to approach the performance of lidar-based algorithms in ideal conditions and surpass them in adverse conditions.\nPrevious works in this area have made significant progress towards radar-based odometry [2-4, 9, 11, 14-16, 26, 34, 39] and place recognition [20, 22, 31, 43, 46] .",
        "Domain generalized semantic segmentation aims to better predict pixel-level semantic labels on multiple unseen target domains while learning only on the source domain. Unfortunately, the domain shift between the source and target domains makes a segmentation model trained on the given source data behave stupidly on the unseen target data, as shown in Fig. 1b . In domain generalization (DG), the low generalization performance for unseen domains is obviously due to overfitting to the source domain. Since the Figure 1 . Semantic segmentation results on (a) an unseen domain image. The models are trained on GTAV [46] train set and validated on Cityscapes [10] validation set. (b) Baseline model overfits the source domain and performs poorly with mIoU 35.16% on the unseen target domain. (c) RobustNet [7] , a state-of-the-art method, improved mIoU to 36.58% by whitening the style, but still has low generalization capability. (d) Our WildNet achieves superior generalization performance with mIoU 44.62% by learning various styles and contents from the wild. More qualitative results on other datasets are available in the supplementary material. model cannot see any information about the target domains in the learning process and even unlabeled target images are not provided unlike domain adaptation (DA), it over-learns the statistical distribution of the given source data.\nRecently, some studies [7, 29, 41, 42] have proposed learning the domain-generalized content feature by 'removing' domain-specific style information from the data to prevent overfitting to the source domain. Based on the correlation between the feature's covariance matrix and style [13, 14] , they assumed that only content features would remain if elements of features considered the domain-specific style were whitened [23, 30, 50, 53] . However, since the content and style are not orthogonal, whitening the style may cause a loss of semantic content, which is indispensable for semantic category prediction. As a result, they predict semantic categories from incomplete content features and have difficulty making accurate predictions, as shown in Fig. 1c .\nIn this paper, we propose a new domain generalized semantic segmentation network called WildNet, which learns the domain-generalized semantic feature by 'extending' both content and style to the wild. Although some previous works [22, 45, 62] utilized various styles from the wild, e.g., ImageNet [11] for real styles and Painter by Numbers [38] for unreal styles, they overlooked that the high generalization ability comes from learning not only various styles but also various contents. In contrast to previous studies, our main idea is to naturally learn domain-generalized semantic information by leveraging a variety of contents and styles from the wild, without forcing whitening on domainspecific styles.\nTo extend both content and style to the wild, we present four effective learning methods. (i) Based on the relevance of style and feature statistics, feature stylization diversifies the style of the source feature by transferring the statistics of the wild feature to the source feature over several layers. (ii) To prevent overfitting to the source contents, we propose content extension learning to increase the intra-class content variability in the latent embedding space.",
        "The advancements in information technology have led to a substantial proliferation of complex data, e.g., non-Euclidean graphs and multi-view data. Data originating from a variety of sources, each of which exhibits different characteristics, are often referred to as multi-view data. As a special type of multi-view data, multi-relational graphs contain two or more relations over a vertex set (Qu et al. 2017) . For instance, in the case of social networks, users and their profiles are considered as nodes and attributes, where each user interacts with others through multiple types of relationships such as friendship, colleague, and co-following.\nClustering is a practical technique to handle rich multirelational graphs by finding a unique cluster pattern of nodes. One principle underlying multi-relational clustering is to leverage consistency and complementarity among multiple views to achieve good performance. For example, SwMC (Nie et al. 2017 ) learns a shared graph from multiple graphs by using a weighting strategy; O2MAC (Fan et al. 2020 ) extracts shared representations across multiple views from the most informative graph; MCGC (Pan and Kang 2021) utilizes a set of adaptive weights to learn a highquality graph from the original multi-relational graphs. A key component of these methods is graph filtering, which fuses the topology structure and attribute information. They show that impressive performance can be achieved even without using neural networks (Lin et al. 2023; Pan and Kang 2023b) . This provides a smart way for traditional machine learning methods to benefit from representation learning techniques. Nevertheless, they simply use a low-pass filter without fully considering the correlation between different views. Moreover, these filters are empirically designed and fixed, which is not flexible to suit different data.\nHow to explore the correlation among multiple graphs is a critical problem in multi-view learning. Lyu et al (Lyu et al. 2022) theoretically illustrate that the correlation-based objective functions are effective in extracting shared and private information in multi-view data under some assumptions. Among them, Barlow Twins (Zbontar et al. 2021 ) is particularly popular. It consists of two parts: the invariance term maximizes the correlation between the same feature across different views, while the redundancy term decorrelates different features across various views. The feature decorrelation operation not only exploits the correlation of multiple views but also effectively alleviates the problem of representation collapse in self-supervised learning. This idea has been applied to graph clustering, such as MVGC (Xia et al. 2022) and MGDCR (Mo et al. 2023 ). However, existing methods simply use Barlow Twins, without any special operations catering to multi-relational graphs. Consequently, they still suffer from collapse. To show this, we visualize the feature distributions of several representative methods in ACM data: contrastive learning-based method MGCCN (Liu et al. 2022b ), Barlow Twins-based method MGDCR (Mo et al. 2023) , and our proposed method Barlow Twins Guided Filter (BTGF). Comparing Figs. 1(a ) and 1(b), we can observe the advantage of Barlow Twins. From Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), a more evident enhancement in BTGF can be found.\nIn this work, we reveal that an input with a negative semidefinite inner product will lead to a lower bound for Barlow Twins loss, while an input with a positive semi-definite inner product has an upper bound.",
        "One of the core problems of system identification, machine learning and statistics is regression, i.e., how to construct models from a sample of noisy input-output data. The main task of regression is typically to estimate, based on a finite number of observations, the regression function, which for a given input encodes the conditional expectation of the corresponding output (Cucker and Zhou, 2007) .\nThere are a number of well-known approaches to solve regression problems, such as least squares (linear regression), prediction error and instrumental variable methods, neural networks, and kernel machines (Gy\u00f6rfi et al., 2002) .\nStandard approaches to regression often provide point estimates, while region estimates, which are vital for robust approaches and risk management, are typically constructed using the asymptotic distribution of the (scaled) estimation errors. On the other hand, from a practical point a view, methods with nonasymptotic and distribution-free guarantees are preferable. There are various types of region estimates that we can consider, which include confidence regions in the parameter space (Cs\u00e1ji et al., 2014) , confidence or credible bands for the expected outputs at given query points (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) , and prediction regions for the next (noisy) observations (Vovk et al., 2005; Garatti et al., 2019) . This paper focuses on building simultaneous confidence bands for the regression function. In a parametric setting such regions are simply induced by confidence regions in the parameter space, however, in a nonparametric setting these indirect approaches are typically not suitable.\nWhen the data are Gaussian, an impressive framework is offered by Gaussian process regression (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) , which can provide prediction regions for the outputs, and credible regions for the expected outputs. However, in practical situations the Gaussianity assumption is sometimes too strong, which motivates alternative approaches with weaker statistical assumptions.\nIn a recent paper a novel nonasymptotic method was suggested to build data-driven confidence bands for bounded, band-limited (regression) functions based on the theory of Paley-Wiener kernels (Cs\u00e1ji and Horv\u00e1th, 2022) . It is distribution-free in the sense that only mild statistical assumptions are required about the noise on the observations, such as they are symmetric, independent from the inputs, and that the sample contains independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input-output pairs. On the other hand, the distribution of the inputs is assumed to be known, in particular, uniformly distributed.",
        "The current COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic is rapidly spreading and significantly impacts healthcare systems. Stay-at-home and social distancing orders enforced in many countries are supporting the control of the disease's spread, while causing turmoil in the economic balance and in social structures [BBD + 20]. Rapid detection of cases and contacts is an essential component in controlling the spread of the pandemic. In the US, the current estimation is that at least 500,000 Covid-19 tests will need to be performed daily in order to successfully reopen the economy [LVLM20] Unfortunately, as humanity attempts to limit the global COVID-19 infection, prophylactic actions are grandly slowed-down by the severe shortages of COVID-19 testing kits [BEF20] .\nThere are currently two types of tests for COVID-19:\n-Molecular diagnostic tests that detect the presence of SARS-COV-2 nucleic acids in human samples. A positive result of these tests indicates the presence of the virus in the body. -Serological diagnostic tests that identify antibodies (e.g., IgM, IgG) to SARS-COV-2 in clinical specimens [WKLT20] . Serological tests, also known as antibody tests, can be helpful in identifying not only those who are ill, but also those who have been infected, as antibodies are still present in their blood. This identification may be important for several reasons. First, this test can differentiate those who are immune to the virus and those who are still at risk. Secondly, identifying populations who have antibodies can facilitate research on the use of convalescent plasma in the development of a cure for COVID-19 [FA20] .\nWork done when the author was with \u00c9NS and Ingenico Laboratories.\nAs mentioned, both tests are in very short supply.",
        "Two-layer neural networks (also referred to as neural networks with one hidden layer) are functions f : R d \u2192 R of the following form\nEQUATION\nwhere {b i } n i=1 \u2282 R d and {a i } n i=1 \u2282 R are referred to as weights, {c i } n i=1 \u2282 R as biases, and \u03c3 : R \u2192 R as the activation function. The brackets \u2022, \u2022 denote the scalar product in R d . Individual summands {\u03c3( x, b i + c i )} n i=1 are referred to as neurons and collectively they are referred to as the hidden layer of the network.\nThe famous universal approximation theorem [1] [2] [3] states that if \u03c3 is not a polynomial then any continuous function on a compact set in R d can be approximated arbitrary well (in the supremum norm) with functions of the type (1.1). However, quantitative estimates (such as the number of neurons required to achieve a certain accuracy) that can be obtained in general depend on the dimension of the input space d, with the approximation error scaling as O(n -d ). For high-dimensional inputs (d 1) this is not satisfactory, an effect which is known as the curse of dimensionality. Barron [4] showed that for L 1 functions whose Fourier transform satisfies a certain integrability condition dimension-independent Monte-Carlo rates O(1/ \u221a n) can be obtained for the approximation error in L 2 . The condition introduced by Barron is, however, too conservative, and fails for many functions that can be approximated by (1.1) with dimension-independent rates. More general spaces, termed variation norm spaces, were studied in, e.g., [5] [6] [7] [8] . Roughly speaking, these spaces consist of functions whose expansion coefficients in a certain basis or frame are absolutely summable. This approach was further extended in [9] who replaced the basis/frame expansion with an integral over a compact latent space against a finite Radon measure. This work was continued in [10] , where it was shown that these spaces are in some sense optimal: they contain all weak-* limits of (1.1) as n \u2192 \u221e if (1.1) . We postpone the details to Section 3.1. These spaces were called variation norm (or F 1 ) spaces in [9] and Barron spaces in [10, 11] , not to be confused with the spaces introduced by Barron in [4] . We will use the notation F 1 for these spaces.\nSimilar results can be arrived at from the mean-field perspective [12] [13] [14] [15] , where a 1 n scaling is assumed in (1.1)\nEQUATION\nand individual neurons are interpreted as interacting particles moving in a potential determined by the loss function. Since the optimal (trained) coefficients {a i } n i=1 depend on n (cf. Remark 3.23), the formulations (1.1) and (1.2) are, in fact, equivalent.\nA related concept is that of random feature models [16] in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, which have the same form (1.1) but differ from F 1 functions in the way the parameters {a i } n i=1 and {b i , c i } n i=1 are trained. While in the case of F 1 functions all parameters are trainable (which is sometimes referred to as active training), in random feature models the parameters {b i , c i } n i=1 are fixed (sampled from a given distribution over the latent space) and only the coefficients {a i } n i=1 are trained (this is sometimes referred to as lazy training). Features can have a more general form than in (1.1) .",
        "P OINT set registration is a fundamental but challenging methodology, which is widely used in the fields of computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics, for 3D model reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), cultural heritage management, etc. With the development of 3D scanning devices, it has become easy to obtain point cloud representations of real-world models or scenes. However, a non-negligible fact is that due to the occlusion of scenes or objects and the limited scanning field of view, most scanning devices only capture partial point clouds at one time. Thus, in order to accurately recover the whole model or scene from a sequence of scans captured from different viewpoints, point set registration problem arises. It aims at determining the rigid transformations of these scans between a given centered-frame Yugeng Huang, Haitao Liu and Tian Huang are with the School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, P.R. China (e-main: liuht@tju.edu.cn; huangyugeng@tju.edu.cn). so as to align multi-view scans into an entire model or scene. Depending on the amount of input point clouds, point set registration can be divided into two problems, namely, pairwise registration and multi-view registration [1] .\nIn the past few decades, several methods have been proposed to solve the pair-wise registration problem and these methods can be classified into two categories, i.e., coarse registration methods and fine registration methods [1] . For the former, the feature-based methods are the most popular and have been extensively studied, which usually contain three significant steps: extracting geometric features composed of keypoints and corresponding descriptors, matching features to obtain the correspondences, and estimating the rigid transformation based on the correspondences. Usually, the performance of the feature-based methods is affected by point density, outliers, and overlapping percentage [2] . The deep learning-based methods, widely studied in recent years, are likely to overcome these drawbacks [1] . Compared to coarse registration, fine registration can achieve more accurate results for pair-wise registration.",
        "In knowledge distillation (KD), information is transferred from the teacher to student model, improving the performance of the student model (Hinton et al., 2015) . In general, a student model is a small neural network with a lower learning capacity compared to that of the teacher model. Many attempts have been made to reduce the size of large models using KD (Liu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; West et al., 2021) . This is because the huge size of large pretrained models such as CLIP and GPT-3 results in increased resource consumption and inference costs, limiting their usage in downstream applications (Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2021) .\nSeveral recent studies have elucidated why KD improves model performance (Yuan et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021) . However, few studies have researched the other advantages of KD besides its improving model performance. Through this study, we demonstrated that KD could improve not only the generalization performance of models but also the interpretability, which indicates the reliability of models.\nResearchers have attempted to understand the internal decision-making processes of neural networks, which essentially seem to be black boxes (Singla et al., 2019; Sundararajan et al., 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2016) . For large models such as CLIP and GPT-3 to be applied to various studies, it is necessary to secure explainability (Gerlings et al., 2021; van der Velden et al., 2022) . Many studies consider the interpretability of a model high if the activation is objectcentric (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Dabkowski & Gal, 2017; Zintgraf et al., 2017) . In this study, we found that KD promoted the object-centricity of the activation map of student models and thereby enhanced their interpretability.\nFigure 1 summarizes the main arguments of this study. First, to compare the interpretability of the models, we adopted the number of concept detectors introduced in network dissection (Bau et al., 2017) as a measure of interpretability. The number of concept detectors represents the degree of the object-centricity of activation maps and is directly proportional to the model interpretability. According to the defined terms of interpretability, we compared the interpretability of models trained from scratch (f scratch ) and trained using KD (f KD ), as shown in Figures 1 (a ) and (b). Comparing the activation maps shown in Figures 1 (a ) and (b), the activation map of f KD is more object-centric than that of f scratch .\nWe attributed this improvement in interpretability to the class-similarity information transferred from the teacher to student models. The distribution of a teacher model had a high similarity between the semantically similar classes. For example, when the input image was a Border Collie, the student model was trained to minimize the distance from the distribution of the teacher model z t , which had a high probability of classes belonging to \"dog.\" Thus, whenever \"dog\" samples were used as input, the student model could learn the typical characteristics of a \"dog,\" which supported the object-centricity of the learned representation of the student model.\nTo demonstrate that class-similarity information enhances the interpretability of student models, we measured the entropy of semantically similar classes to confirm the transfer of class-similarity information from the teacher to student model via logit distillation. Then, we compared the interpretability between the model trained by label smoothing (f LS ), which did not contain (rather negatively affected) class-similarity information, and f KD . As shown in Figures 1 (b) and (c), f LS learns other features than objects, such as the background, which reduces the model interpretability. Referring to the previous example, for f LS , the probability of an irrelevant class (e.g., valley) increases because the model reduces the distance to a uniform distribution u, causing the map of f LS to become less objectcentric.",
        "Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become a popular tool for deriving constrained control laws that are safe, easy to implement, and achieve good performance [1] - [4] . Despite their success, the widespread use of CBFs is limited by the absence of a systematic method to synthesize them for general classes of systems given arbitrary state and input constraints.\nIn [5] , the authors study the relationship between the CBFcondition, input constraints, and the CBF decay rate to guarantee pointwise feasibility. However, their approach does not guarantee recursive feasibility. In [6] , the authors design CBFs for Euler-Lagrange systems. While the results are promising and the class of systems is relevant, the approach is limited to box constraints. In [7] , the authors use a backup control policy to enlarge a small (but easy to find) control invariant set. The enlarged control invariant set is then used to derive a \"backup\" CBF. These backup CBFs rarely have closed form, which makes them difficult to implement. In [8] , the authors use maximal output admissible sets (MOASs) to design discretetime CBFs for arbitrary state and input constraints. While the approach works well for linear systems, finding the MOAS for nonlinear systems remains an open question.\nThis work expands the underlying theme of [7] , [8] , where CBFs are obtained starting from a prestabilizing (or backup) controller. To do this, we adopt the notion of dynamic safety margin (DSM) from the explicit reference governor (ERG) framework [9] . In particular, we show that DSMs are CBFs for the augmented system that includes the reference of the prestabilizing controller as a state. To address multiple constraints, we also show that DSMs have the control-sharing property [10] if they share the same prestabilizing controller. The main advantage of this analysis is that it enables the synthesis of CBFs using established tools from the ERG framework [9] , [11] - [13] .",
        "Teaching the theory of evolution via natural selection has become a controversial issue in the United States educational system in recent decades (Sinatra et al., 2008) . Even after setting aside the political and religious motivations for resistance, there remains a central challenge that evolution via natural selection is counter-intuitive partially because it occurs at spatial or temporal scales that are difficult or impossible for humans to observe, let alone understand. There are many efforts underway to improve this problem of observable evolutionary dynamics, and one of them is to incorporate evolution into games. This approach enables people to observe evolution in a context that can be nonconfrontational and on temporal and spatial scales that they can grasp.\nThere have been a number of games that attempt to incorporate evolution as a central or secondary game mechanic, however they run into several recurring issues. One such issue is that evolution via natural selection is an inherently directionless process and there is a great temptation by game developers to add direction to it to make a game more fun. This change, however, reinforces a common misconception of evolution via natural selection, namely that of some being (either a deity or the organisms themselves) directing the process towards a goal (e.g. Spore (Bean et al., 2010) ). Some educational games have a primary aim of demonstrating evolution by natural selection correctly, but end up being games that are not particularly fun to play. Even when a developer succeeds at creating a game that is both scientifically accurate and fun, they face an uphill battle to gain a large fanbase and achieve the goal of demonstrating evolution via natural selection to a large audience. Finally, if a game markets itself as being a game about evolution via natural selection, those who are resistant to accepting the idea of evolution are unlikely to even try the game. Therefore, if the goal is to use games to improve evolution understanding and acceptance, a game would have to 1) correctly implement evolution via natural selection, 2) be fun, 3) amass a large fanbase, and 4) not be overtly about evolution via natural selection.\nCreating a new game that will achieve those four criteria is a difficult problem, however we suggest an alternative. Some games support community modifications of the game code, called mods, that allow programmers to tack on extra features to an existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) game.",
        "M OTION planning is essential for autonomy of a robot in completing a task. In practice, robotic systems are subject to unmodeled dynamics or environment, which is often compensated by introducing random processes, i.e. noise, to the system model. The noise needs to be explicitly considered in the motion planning in order to complete a task reliably. In this work, we refer to such motion planning problems as stochastic motion planning. More specifically, we consider the problem of navigating a car-like robot with a range sensor.\nA principled way to solve stochastic motion planning is to model the problem as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [1] . Methods following this approach are often known as belief space planning in the robotics community. van den Berg et al. [2] extend iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) [3] to belief dynamics, and propose (belief space) iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG), which solves a local optimal control policy for a continuous POMDP. Superior performance is shown in [2] for light-dark domain problems, where measurements have small or large noise in light or dark regions respectively. However, few work has reported successful applications of iLQG for more common sensors, such as range sensors considered in this work.\nWe summarize the reasons for the lack of applications of iLQG to range sensors as follows. First, iLQG requires the underlying system to have differentiable motion and measurement models. However, because of the discontinuity in the environment, the range sensor model is often nondifferentiable. Second, informative measurements, i.e. measurements that are effective in reducing localization uncertainty, from range sensors are sparse. To elaborate, informative measurements can only be obtained if obstacles are within the maximum sensing range of the beams. If the robot is sufficiently far from the obstacles with all measurements saturated at the maximum range, it cannot be known where to move to collect informative measurements by just locally perturbing the robot state. In terms of optimization, it means a majority of states are saddle points, providing trivial gradient information and preventing iLQG from converging to a local minimum.",
        "Projected stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a fundamental approach to solving large-scale constrained single-level machine learning problems. Specifically, to minimize E \u03be [L(x; \u03be)] over a given convex set X , it generates the sequence x k+1 = Proj X (x k -\u03b1\u2207L(x k ; \u03be k )), where \u03b1 > 0 is the stepsize and \u2207L(x k ; \u03be k ) is a stochastic gradient estimate of E \u03be L(x k ; \u03be) . If E \u03be [L(x; \u03be)] is nonconvex, projected SGD requires a sample complexity of O( -2 ) with O(1/ ) batch size [25] . The requirement of O(1/ ) batch size has been later relaxed [14] using the Moreau envelope technique, and its convergence rate matches that of vanilla SGD.\nHowever, recent machine learning applications often go beyond the single-level structure, including hyperparameter optimization [19, 47] , meta-learning, [18] reinforcement learning, [56] and neural architecture search [40] . While the nonasymptotic analysis of the alternating implicit SGD for unconstrained bilevel optimization with strongly convex and smooth lower-level problems was wellunderstood [8, 24, 29, 32, 37] , to the best of our knowledge, the finite-time guarantee of alternating implicit projected SGD on bilevel problems with both upper-level (UL) and lower-level (LL) constraints have not been investigated yet. In this context, a natural but important question is Can we establish the \u00d5( -2 ) sample complexity of alternating implicit projected SGD for a family of bilevel problems with both UL and LL constraints?\nWe give an affirmative answer to this question for the following stochastic bilevel optimization problems with both UL and LL constraints, given by \nEQUATION\nwhere \u03be and \u03c6 are random variables, X = {x | Bx = e} \u2282 R dx and Y(x) = {y | Ay + h(x) = c} \u2282 R dy are closed convex set; A \u2208 R my\u00d7dy , B \u2208 R mx\u00d7dx , c \u2208 R my , e \u2208 R mx , h : R dx \u2192 R my ; A and B are not necessarily full row or column rank and the coupling function h can be nonlinear. In (1) , the UL optimization problem depends on the solution of the LL optimization over y, and both the LL function and constraint set depend on the UL variable x. The equality-constrained bilevel problem (1) covers a wider class of applications than unconstrained bilevel optimization, such as distributed bilevel optimization [57, 63] , hyperparameter optimization for optimal transport [27, 46] , and the design of transportation networks [1, 48] . When A = 0, B = 0, h = 0, c = 0, e = 0, the problem (1) reduces to the unconstrained stochastic bilevel problem [8, 9, 24, 29, 32, 35, 37] .",
        "Recently, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted communication has emerged as a promising approach to satisfy the escalating demand for high spectral and energy efficiency in future wireless systems. Specifically, comprising cost-effective passive and programmable elements, IRSs possess the capability to intelligently establish favorable wireless propagation environments such that the signal paths between various communication nodes can be tailored [1] - [6] . By leveraging this appealing property, one can concentrate the energy of the transmitted signal in desired directions via beamforming, which facilitates power savings in wireless systems. Moreover, typically fabricated as thin rectangular planes, IRSs can be conveniently attached to building facades, indoor ceilings, and vehicles, thereby enabling seamless integration of IRSs into existing wireless systems [6] , [7] . Driven by these advanced features, numerous works have explored the application of IRSs in wireless systems, aiming to enhance, e.g., multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission [8] , physical layer security [9] , and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [10] .\nTo fully exploit the vast potential of IRSs, both the phase shift configuration of the IRS and the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) have to be delicately designed [4] , [6] , [10] , [11] . In light of this, several works have developed joint BS beamforming and IRS reflection coefficient design policies for the minimization of the total transmit power while guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) of the communication users. Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge, transmit power minimization problems were investigated for different IRS-assisted wireless systems, including multiuser MIMO systems [2] , secure wireless systems [11] , and SWIPT systems [10] . However, the significant power savings shown in [2] , [10] , and [11] rely on the assumption of continuous IRS phase shifts, which may not be applicable in practical IRS systems. In practice, due to various challenges, such as high energy consumption, high integration complexity, and intractable component coupling, the phase shifts generated by each IRS element are generally confined to discrete values and low resolution. In fact, practical largescale IRSs typically utilize 1-bit on-off phase shifters or 2-bit quadruple-level phase shifters [4] , [6] , [12] .\nTo account for this limitation, several early studies have investigated the resource allocation design for discrete IRS phase shifts. For example, in [12] , a suboptimal alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm was developed to promote user fairness in IRS-assisted multiuser systems with discrete IRS phase shifts.\nHowever, as shown in [8] , [11] , for the considered non-convex optimization problems, iterative AO-based algorithms unavoidably compromise the optimality of the solution. In particular, it is well-known that these algorithms may get trapped in a locally optimal solution [8] , [11] , [13] , and their performance depends heavily on the choice of the initial points, which may lead to an unsatisfactory system performance. To investigate the optimal performance of IRS-assisted systems, in [4] , the authors considered a single-user scenario and determined the optimal BS beamformer and the optimal discrete IRS phase shifts using an enumeration-based algorithm. However, this scheme cannot be directly extended to multiuser systems, as finding closed-form optimal beamforming vectors seems intractable for multiuser scenarios. Moreover, assuming perfect CSI, in the conference version [1] of this paper, a novel algorithm based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) framework was developed for attaining the globally jointly optimum BS beamformer and discrete IRS phase shift matrix for a simplified multiuser system model without direct link between the BS and the users. However, the optimal design for IRS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with direct link and imperfect CSI is still an open problem.\nThe authors of [1] , [4] assume the perfect CSI of the IRS-assisted wireless system can be acquired.\nUnfortunately, due to the passive nature of IRSs, it is challenging to estimate the IRS-assisted links with conventional channel estimation schemes. As such, channel estimation errors are generally inevitable, leading to availability of imperfect CSI only [7] , [9] . Furthermore, when considering the IRS-assisted links, i.e., the BS-IRS and IRS-user channels, they are typically cascaded into one effective channel for end-to-end channel estimation. Therefore, the CSI of the BS-IRS and IRS-user channels, along with the corresponding estimation errors should be considered jointly [7] , [14] .",
        "To meet the demands of privacy regulation, federated learning (FL) [31] is boosting to model decentralized data in both academia and industry. This is because FL enables the collaboration of clients with decentralized data, aiming to develop a high-performing global model without the need for data transfer. However, conventional FL work mostly assumes that client data is well-labeled, which is less practical in real-world applications. In this work, we consider the * Chaochao Chen is the corresponding author.\nproblem of federated unsupervised learning (FUSL) with non-IID data [14, 43] , i.e., modeling unified representation among imbalanced, unlabeled, and decentralized data.\nUtilizing existing centralized unsupervised methods cannot adapt to FUSL which has non-IID data [44] . To mitigate it, one of the popular categories is to train self-supervised learning models, e.g., BYOL [8] , SimCLR [3] , and Simsiam [5] , in clients, and aggregate models via accounting extremely divergent model [44, 45] , knowledge distillation [9] , and combining with clustering [30] . However, two coupling challenges of FUSL, i.e., CH1: Mitigating representation collapse entanglement, and CH2: Obtaining unified representation spaces, are not well considered.\nThe first challenge is that representation collapse [13] in the client subsequently exacerbates the representation of global and other local models. Motivated by regularizing Frobenius norm of representation in centralized selfsupervised models [15, 21] , FedDecorr [36] tackles representation collapse with the global supervision signals in federated supervised learning. But directly applying these methods to FUSL has three aspects of limitations. Firstly, it relies on large data batch size [30] to capture reliable distribution statistics, e.g., representation variance. Besides, regularizing the norm of high-dimensional representations inevitably causes inactivated neurons and suppresses meaningful features [18] . Moreover, clients cannot eliminate representation collapse entanglement by decorrelating representations for FUSL problem, once clients represent data in different representation spaces.",
        "Osteoporotic fractures are common in older adults and resulted in more than two million Disability Adjusted Life Years in Europe [10] . The presence of vertebrae fractures dramatically increases the probability of subsequent fractures [13] ; thus can be used as an early marker of osteoporosis. Medical imaging, such as Computed Tomography (CT), is a useful tool to identify fractures [14] . However, radiologists frequently miss fractures, especially if they are not specializing in musculoskeletal imaging; with the average error rate being higher than 50% Step 2: c) identifying key-points and the corresponding heights; d-e) a closer look at some vertebrae (colors denote the fracture severity). Finally: f) the original image with estimated fracture severities. [18] . At the same time, rapidly evolving low dose CT programs, e.g., for lung cancer, provide a solid basis for opportunistic screening of vertebral fractures.\nThe medical image computing community thoroughly investigated fractures detection and/or classification on vertebrae-level [24, 27, 5, 1] , whole study-level [26, 2] , or jointly on both levels [19] , see Section 2 for more details. Many of these approaches require prior vertebrae detection [1, 27, 19] , or spine segmentation [5, 24, 2] . Though both problems are active areas of research with prominent results, fractured vertebrae are the most complex cases for these algorithms [25] , and even good average detection/segmentation accuracy may not be sufficient for accurate fracture estimation. As a result, researchers had to exclude some studies from the subsequent fracture classification due to errors in prior segmentation [27] , or due to scoliosis [26] .\nThe second important issue is the mismatch between computer science problem statements and the radiological way to define fractures. The Genant scale [7] is a widely used medical criterion recommended by the International Osteoporosis Foundation [6] .",
        "A new strain of game theory -Compositional Game Theory (CGT) -was introduced recently [9] . At its core, CGT involves a completely new representation of games -open games -with operators for constructing larger and more complex games from smaller, simpler (and hence easier to reason about) ones. Despite recent substantial interest and further development [13, 10, 7, 6, 4, 11, 14] , open games remain complex structures, e.g. the simplest form of an open game is an 8-tuple consisting of 4 ports, a set of strategies, play and coplay functions and an equilibrium predicate. More advanced versions [4] require sophisticated structures such as coends. This causes problems: (i) complex definitions lead to complex and even error prone proofs; (ii) proofs are programs and overly complex proofs turn into overly complex programs; (iii) even worse, this complexity deters experimentation and innovation, for instance the authors of [10] were deterred from trying alternative definitions as the work became prohibitive; and (iv) worse still, this complexity suggests we do not fully understand the mathematical structure of open games.\nCategory theorists have an answer to such complexity: trade complex definitions in a simple category for simpler definitions in a more complex category. This simplified open games by factoring their definition via the category of lenses, and this more abstract perspective led directly to the discovery of Bayesian Open Games [4] where one naturally swaps out lenses in favour of optics when one starts with a monoidal category. Swapping out a subcomponent for another is a hallmark of compositionality, but, because the definition of open games is not compositional, one has to redevelop all the structure of open games built over optics from scratch. The same thing happens with open games with mixed strategies [10] where a small change -here to the type of the equilibrium predicate -leads to the need to redevelop the full theory of these open games. The same story is true if we want to (i) replace equilibria with best-response; or (ii) add type dependency; or (iii) allow the covariant play function and contravariant co-play function to live in different categories; or (iv) build open games over monadic effects; or (v) consider a host of other variations of open games. Every single time we must show from scratch that a given variant of open game forms a monoidal category -a highly non-trivial task.\nWe present a compositional approach to CGT which allows us exactly to make small modifications to the definition of an open game, check these modifications have suitable local properties, and conclude the resulting open games do indeed form a monoidal category. As with compositionality in general, we start with a semantic structure and define operators to build more complex examples from smaller ones. The semantic structure we use is a presentation of monoidal categories using profunctors and Arrows [17] . This simplifies the treatment of the monoidal structure to that of a strength, and also allows us to work in a purely functorial setting.",
        "Neurostimulation technologies have shown promising, initial success over the last 20 years in treating neurological disorders such as drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), Parkinson's disease (PD), and psychological conditions such as depression (Lin and Wang, 2017; Ben-Menachem, 2012; Marangell et al., 2007) . Stimulation of the brain is also being increasingly used as a means to map the functional properties of various regions of the brain (Mandonnet et al., 2010) and is also seen as a mode to enhance sensory-motor activity (Jones et al., 2015; Toth et al., 2021) . While the potency of external electromagnetic stimulation has been established in the literature and neuromodulation under varying input conditions has been studied, clinical delivery of stimulation has largely been applied in an open-loop expert-driven manner where constant stimulation is provided for large periods of time (sometimes months). Such open-loop stimulation has been associated with inconsistent responses and sub-optimal modulation which can be linked to the high sensitivity of the brain to stimulation parameters (Deeb et al., 2016) . Although closed-loop control of stimulation can potentially help address these issues (e.g., the RNS \u00ae system from NeuroPace, Inc (Skarpaas et al., 2019) ), a large majority of works have focused on ON-OFF control that relies on medically-derived biomarkers such as signal line length, signal power in certain frequency bands, or tremor onset as opposed to predictive evaluation of the brain's response to stimulation. These factors, together with the low efficacy of state-of-the-art controllers (e.g., complete seizure abatement in the case of the RNS \u00ae system was reported in only 20% of individuals) and the demand for more energy-efficient systems (Ramirez-Zamora et al., 2018) make stimulation tuning via fully closed loop control a necessity. A major hurdle in the development of fully-closed-loop controllers is the mechanistic complexity of the brain and modeling its response to various forms of stimulation. Despite the rising relevance of neurostimulation and the rapid advancement in brain activity monitoring systems (e.g., fMRI, iEEG), the exact mechanism through which neurostimulation inputs interact with the brain connectome is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present a focused review of methods employed in the literature towards understanding the response of the brain to five of the most commonly used neurostimulation techniques, namely, deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), direct electric stimulation (DES), transcranial electric stimulation (tES), and optogenetic stimulation. Existing reviews on different neurostimulation methods have largely focused on the efficacy of each method towards treating conditions such as PD, depression, or epilepsy and have had little emphasis on the brain modeling approaches that have been employed for each method (De Raedt et al., 2015; Kassiri et al., 2017; Magis and Schoenen, 2012; Starnes et al., 2019; Schoenen et al., 2016) . A few works have provided focused reviews of specific stimulation mechanisms (Montagni et al., 2019; Chervyakov et al., 2015) based on the underlying neuroscience and usage of different biomarkers towards adaptive stimulation (Bouthour et al., 2019) . In Lozano et al. (2019) and Herrington et al. (2016) , the authors have compiled various neural mechanisms (the inhibition of thalamic neurons, e.g.) explaining the DBS response to a range of disorders. To the best of our knowledge, existing reviews lack compiled collections of works on the modeling of the brain's response to various neurostimulation techniques, hence motivating the present review. Broadly, the computational modeling studies of the aforementioned neurostimulation methods can be categorized into three types of approaches :\n1. Works that use electric field equations and/or neuron models to build biophysically-derived models of the interaction between the stimulation input and the brain. These models are often parameterized by factors such as conductivity and geometry of brain tissues and are tuned to mimic observed data. As such, they are then commonly simulated to computationally optimize stimulation parameters such as input location and intensity.\n2. Works that use statistical and machine learning tools such as correlation, hypothesis testing, and/or artificial neural networks to model the overall stimulus-response profile of stimulation. Unlike the theory-driven nature of the first category, these models are fundamentally data-driven. However, they often are not intended to capture the temporal dynamics of the brain's response to neurostimulation, as done by the last category. 3. Lastly, we have works where the impact of neurostimulation on the brain's network neural dynamics is learned using observed input-output time series data. In general, these methods do not make any assumptions regarding the underlying biophysics and rely mainly on data-driven algorithms. For simplicity of exposition, we will refer to this latter category as \"Dynamical System Models\" while acknowledging the presence of dynamical system components in several of the works in the biophysical category.\nFigure 2 . Year-wise spread of reviewed literature for the three types of approaches. The use of data-driven dynamical systems modeling has markedly increased in recent years while biophysical and stimulus-response models have been employed for significantly longer times. Important to note is the fact that this figure is only intended to inform comparisons between categories, not the absolute historical frequency of the use of each category.",
        "Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces. Deep neural networks have underpinned state of the art empirical results in numerous applied machine learning tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) . Understanding neural network learning, particularly its recent successes, commonly decomposes into the two main themes: (i) studying generalization capacity of the deep neural networks and (ii) understanding why efficient algorithms, such as stochastic gradient, find good weights. Though still far from being complete, previous work provides some understanding on generalization capability of deep neural networks. However, question (ii) is rather poorly understood. While learning algorithms succeed in practice, theoretical analysis is overly pessimistic. Direct interpretation of theoretical results suggests that when going slightly deeper beyond single layer networks, e.g. to depth-two networks with very few hidden units, it is hard to predict even marginally better than random (Daniely et al., 2013; Kearns & Valiant, 1994) .\nThe standard approach to develop generalization bounds on deep learning (and machine learning) was developed in seminal papers by (Vapnik, 1998) , and it is based on bounding the difference between the generalization error and the training error. These bounds are expressed in terms of the so called VC-dimension of the class. However, these bounds are very loose when the VC-dimension of the class can be very large, or even infinite. In 1998, several authors (Bartlett & Shawe-Taylor, 1999; Bartlett et al., 1998) suggested another class of upper bounds on generalization error that are expressed in terms of the empirical distribution of the margin of the predictor (the classifier). Later, Koltchinskii and Panchenko proposed new probabilistic upper bounds on generalization error of the combination of many complex classifiers such as deep neural networks (Koltchinskii & Panchenko, 2002) . These bounds were developed based on the general results of the theory of Gaussian, Rademacher, and empirical processes in terms of general functions of the margins, satisfying a Lipschitz condition. They improved previously known bounds on generalization error of convex combination of classifiers. (Truong, 2022a) and Truong (2022b) have recently provided generalization bounds for learning with Markov dataset based on Rademacher and Gaussian complexity functions. The development of new symmetrization inequalities and contraction lemmas in highdimensional probability for Markov chains is a key element in these works. Several recent works have focused on gradient descent based PAC-Bayesian algorithms, aiming to minimise a generalisation bound for stochastic classifiers (Biggs & Guedj, 2021; Dziugaite & Roy., 2017) . Most of these studies use a surrogate loss to avoid dealing with the zero-gradient of the misclassification loss. There were some other works which use information-theoretic approach to find PAC-bounds on generalization errors for machine learning (Esposito et al., 2021; Xu & Raginsky, 2017) and deep learning (Jakubovitz et al., 2018) .\nRecently, deep equilibrium model (DEQ) (Bai et al., 2019) was introduced as a new approach to modelling sequential data. In many many existing deep sequence models, the hidden layers converge toward some fixed points. DEQ directly finds these equilibrium points via root-finding of implicit equations. Such a model is equivalent to an infinite-depth weight-tied model with inputinjection. DEQ has emerged as an important model in various aplications such as computer vision (Bai et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2022) , natural language processing (Bai et al., 2019) , and inverse problems (Gilton et al., 2021) . This model has been shown to achieve performance competitive with the state-of-the-art deep networks while using significantly less memory. Despite of the empirical success of DEQ, theoretical understanding of this model is still limited. The effectiveness of overparameterization in optimizing feedforward neural networks has been validated in many research literature (Arora et al., 2019; Du et al., 2018; Li & Liang, 2018) .",
        "In many scientific and engineering disciplines, mathematical and computational simulators are used to gain mechanistic insights. A common challenge is to identify parameter settings of such simulators that make their outputs compatible with a set of empirical observations. For example, by finding a distribution of parameters that, when passed through the Preprint. Under Review. Given an observed dataset D = {x1, . . . , xn} from some data distribution po(x), the source distribution estimation problem is to find the parameter distribution q(\u03b8) that reproduces po(x) when passed through the simulator p(x|\u03b8), i.e. q # (x) = p(x|\u03b8)q(\u03b8)d\u03b8 = po(x). This problem can be ill-posed, as there might be more than one distinct source distribution. We here target the source distribution with maximum entropy, which is unique.\nsimulator, produces a distribution of outputs that matches that of the empirical observations. Suppose we have a stochastic simulator with input parameters \u03b8 and output x, which allows us to generate samples from the forward model p(x|\u03b8) (which is usually intractable). We have acquired a dataset D = {x 1 , ..., x n } of observations with empirical distribution p o (x), and want to identify a distribution q(\u03b8) over parameters that, once passed through the simulator, yields a \"pushforward\" distribution of simulations q # (x) = p(x|\u03b8)q(\u03b8)d\u03b8 that is indistinguishable from the empirical distribution.\nOur setting is known by different names in different disciplines, for example as unfolding in high energy physics (Cowan, 1998) , population of models in electrophysiology (Lawson et al., 2018) and population inference in gravitational wave astronomy (Thrane & Talbot, 2019) . Adopting the terminology of Vandegar et al. (2020) , we refer to this task as source distribution estimation.\nOne approach to source distribution estimation is empirical Bayes (Robbins, 1956; Efron & Morris, 1972) . Empirical Bayes uses hierarchical models in which each ob-servation is modeled as arising from different parameters p(x i |\u03b8 i ). The hyper-parameters of the prior (and thus the source q \u03d5 ) are found by optimizing the marginal likelihood p(D) = i p(x i |\u03b8)q \u03d5 (\u03b8)d\u03b8 over \u03d5. Empirical Bayes has been successfully applied to a range of applications (Lee & Mumford, 2003; Leng et al., 2013; Thrane & Talbot, 2019) . However, the empirical Bayes approach is typically not applicable to models with intractable likelihoods, which is usually the case for scientific simulators. Using surrogate models for such likelihoods, empirical Bayes has been extended to increasingly more complicated parameterizations \u03d5 of the prior distribution, including neural networks (Wang et al., 2019; Vandegar et al., 2020) .\nA more general issue, however, is that the source distribution problem can often be ill-posed without the introduction of a hyper-prior or other regularization principles, as also noted in Vandegar et al.",
        "In this article, we are mainly concerned with the linear programming problem with the small noisy data as follows:\nEQUATION\nwhere c and x are vectors in \u211c n , b is a vector in \u211c m , and A is an m \u00d7 n matrix. For the problem (1) , there are many efficient methods to solve it such as the simplex methods [38, 49] , the interior-point methods [18, 21, 36, 43, 45, 48] and the continuous methods [1, 11, 26, 33] . Those methods are all assumed that the constraints of problem (1) are consistent, i.e. rank(A, b) = rank(A). For the consistent system of redundant constraints, references [3, 4, 34] provided a few preprocessing strategies which are widely used in both academic and commercial linear programming solvers.\nHowever, for a real-world problem, since it may include the redundant constraints and the measurement errors, the rank of matrix A may be deficient and the right-handside vector b has small noise. Consequently, they may lead to the inconsistent system of constraints [6, 12, 29] . On the other hand, the constraints of the original real-world problem are intrinsically consistent. Therefore, we consider the least-squares approximation of the inconsistent constraints in the linear programming problem based on the QR decomposition with column pivoting. Then, according to the first-order KKT conditions of the linear programming problem, we convert the processed problems into the equivalent problem of nonlinear equations with nonnegative constraints. Based on the system of nonlinear equations with nonnegative constraints, we consider a special continuous Newton flow with nonnegative constraints, which has the nonnegative steady-state solution for any nonnegative initial point. Finally, we consider a primal-dual path-following method and the adaptive trust-region updating strategy to follow the trajectory of the continuous Newton flow. Thus, we obtain an optimal solution of the original linear programming problem.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, we consider the primal-dual path-following method and the adaptive trust-region updating strategy for the linear programming problem.",
        "Motivated by several different applications, we study estimating nested expectations which are defined as follows. Let X = (X 1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , X J ) \u2208 R J and Y = (Y 1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , Y K ) \u2208 R K be possibly dependent random variables following the joint probability density \u03c1(X, Y ). For a function f : R J \u2192 R, the nested expectation is defined by\nEQUATION\nHere we emphasize that the outer expectation is taken with respect to the marginal distribution of Y , while the inner expectation is with respect to the conditional distribution of X given Y . Throughout this paper, we simply write \u03c1(X) (resp. \u03c1(Y )) to denote the marginal probability density of X (resp. Y ), and also write \u03c1(X|Y ) (resp. \u03c1(Y |X)) to denote the conditional probability density of X given Y (resp. Y given X).\nThe motivating examples are as follows:\nExample 1 (expected information gain). The concept of Bayesian experimental design aims to construct an optimal experimental design under which making the observation Y maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) on the input random variable \u03b8 [1, 2] . Here the EIG denotes the expected amount of reduction in the Shannon information entropy and is given by\nE \u03c1(Y ) E \u03c1(\u03b8|Y ) log \u03c1(\u03b8|Y ) -E \u03c1(\u03b8) log \u03c1(\u03b8) = E \u03c1(\u03b8) E \u03c1(Y |\u03b8) log \u03c1(Y |\u03b8) -E \u03c1(Y ) log E \u03c1(\u03b8) \u03c1(Y |\u03b8) ,\nwhere the equality follows from Bayes' theorem. A nested expectation appears in the second term on the right-hand side.\nExample 2 (expected value of sample information). Let D be a finite set of possible medical treatments. As the outcome and cost of each treatment d \u2208 D is uncertain, we model its net benefit as a function of the input random variable \u03b8, denoted by NB d , where \u03b8 includes, for instance, the probability of side effect and the cost of treatment.\nIn the context of medical decision making, we want to know whether it is worth conducting a clinical trial or medical research to reduce the uncertainty of \u03b8 [3] . Denoting the observation from a clinical trial or medical research by Y , the expected value of sample information (EVSI) measures the average gain in the net benefit from making the observation Y and is given by\nEQUATION\nwhere the first term represents the average net benefit when choosing the optimal treatment depending on the observation Y , and the second term does the net benefit without making the observation. Here the first term is exactly a nested expectation as given in (1) .\nThe nested Monte Carlo (NMC) method is probably the most straightforward approach to estimate nested expectations. The idea is quite simple: approximating the inner and outer expectations by the standard Monte Carlo methods, respectively. To be more precise, for positive integers N p and N q , the NMC estimator is given by\nEQUATION\nwhere Y (1) , . . . , Y (Np) denote the i.i.d. samples drawn from \u03c1(Y ), X (p,1) , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , X (p,Nq) denote the i.i.d. samples drawn from \u03c1(X|Y = Y (p) ) for each p = 1, . . . , N p , and the inner sum over q is taken element-wise. However, it has been known that a large computational cost is necessary for the NMC method to estimate nested expectations with high accuracy [4] . Moreover, the NMC method has a disadvantage in terms of applicability, since it requires generating the i.i.d. samples from \u03c1(X|Y ), which is often quite hard in applications [5, 6, 7] .\nA typical situation in estimating nested expectations is, instead, that we can generate i.i.d. samples from \u03c1(X) and \u03c1(Y |X), or, those from \u03c1(X, Y ). One way to tackle this issue is to use a Markov chain sampler directly for each \u03c1(X|Y = Y (p) ) in (3) . Although the resulting estimator might be consistent, it is quite hard to obtain a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared error and to choose an optimal allocation for N p and N q with the total cost fixed.",
        "With the rapid development deep learning and the availability of large amounts of data, concerns regarding data privacy have been attracting increasingly more attention from industry and academia. To address this concern, McMahan et al. (2017) propose Federated Learning-a decentralized training paradigm enabling collaborative training across different clients without sharing data.\nOne major challenge in federated learning is the potential discrepancies in the distributions of local training data among clients, which is known as the data heterogeneity problem. In particular, this paper focuses on the heterogeneity of label distributions (see Fig. 1 (a) for an example). Such discrepancies can result in drastic disagreements between the local optima of the clients and the desired global optimum, which may lead to severe performance degradation of the global model. Previous works attempting to tackle this challenge mainly focus on the model parameters, either during local training (Li et al., 2020; Karimireddy et al., 2020) or global aggregation (Wang et al., 2020b) . However, these methods usually result in an excessive computation burden or high communication costs (Li et al., 2021a) because deep neural networks are typically heavily over-parameterized. In contrast, in this work, we focus on the representation space of the model and study the impact of data heterogeneity.\nTo commence, we study how heterogeneous data affects the global model in federated learning in Sec. 3.1. Specifically, we compare representations produced by global models trained under different degrees of data heterogeneity. Since the singular values of the covariance matrix provide a comprehensive characterization of the distribution of high-dimensional embeddings, we use it to study the representations output by each global model. Interestingly, we find that as the degree of data heterogeneity increases, more singular values tend to evolve towards zero. This observation suggests that stronger data heterogeneity causes the trained global model to suffer from more severe dimensional collapse, whereby representations are biased towards residing in a lower-dimensional space (or manifold). A graphical illustration of how heterogeneous training data affect output representations is shown in Fig. 1(b-c ). Our observations suggest that dimensional collapse might be one of the key reasons why federated learning methods struggle under data heterogeneity. Essentially, dimensional collapse is a form of oversimplification in terms of the model, where the representation space is not being fully utilized to discriminate diverse data of different classes.\nGiven the observations made on the global model, we conjecture that the dimensional collapse of the global model is inherited from models locally trained on various clients. This is because the global model is a result of the aggregation of local models. To validate our conjecture, we further visualize the local models in terms of the singular values of representation covariance matrices in Sec.",
        "Neuroimaging advancement has enabled vivid visualization of the human brain in both structural and functional contexts. The brain-computer interface (BCI) was developed using neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) to enable direct brain-computer communication. The decoding of brain patterns can be used to control cursors [1] , [2] , [3] , wheelchairs [4] , [5] or exoskeletons [6] , [7] , [8] .\nP300 oddball stimulus, steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), and motor-related somatosensory rhythms are the three neurological signals extensively used for BCI commands. Both SSVEP-and P300-based BCIs require a short training time and have shown promising outcomes. However, both systems require exogenous stimulation. Conversely, motor-related brain rhythms, generated from motor imagery (MI) or motor planning, involve mentally simulating a motor task without physically engaging the muscles [9] . According to [10] , MI can generate movement-related cortical potential similar to that of actual muscle action without the requirement of external stimulus. EEG features such as event-related desynchronization [11] , beta rebound [12, 13] , empirical mode decomposition [14] , filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) [15] , and functional connectivity (FC) [16] have been adopted to detect motor-related brain activities.\nMost users can now engage with BCIs with promising performance because of advancements in BCI research. However, despite the tremendous effort of training, a non-negligible portion of the population has failed to operate one or more types of BCI systems [17] . According to estimates by [18] , approximately 15 %-30 % of the population is unable to generate brain signals that can be translated into BCI commands. Nevertheless, conventional BCIs decode implicit brain signals without considering the interacting environment.",
        "AI-native RAN is a trending concept that is spearheading the evolution of wireless mobile networks. This concept makes AI pervasive in the entire RAN architecture. The reason being AI's pronounced success for virtually every RAN design/optimization aspect [1] . These AI driven RAN workloads can be deployed at the edge of networks e.g., centralized unit (CU)/distributed unit (DU). Edge-deployed ML workloads, in contrast to traditional cloud-centric architecture, are appealing for fulfilling the latency, scalability, reliability, and privacy needs of beyond-5G applications. Additionally, they present an attractive solution for privacy-focused multi-vendor deployment scenarios and data regulatory compliance.\nNevertheless, a notable limitation in the majority of AIdriven RAN studies is the tendency to address specific RAN problems, features, or use cases in isolation. In such cases, AI is often customized to suit a particular use case, referred to as specialized AI models. Implementing solutions with specialized AI models in live RANs may result in an uncontrolled proliferation of specialized ML models per downstream task (radio feature) that will increase both RAN complexity and operational expenditure. In particular, the independent life-cycle management (LCM) of these edge-distributed independent multiple workloads sharing a resource-constrained compute node (BS, CU/DU) will be challenging in terms of availability of labelled data and compute-memory resources that will scale with denser deployments. Contrary to this, general purpose AI-native RAN vision is much more desirable wherein a single AI algorithm would have the capability to learn and manage a wide spectrum of networking operations, spanning the whole protocol stack. Achieving this involves designing an AI algorithm that can concurrently control multiple RAN tasks (Fig. 1 ). Multi-task learning (MTL) is one such paradigm that can be used to train a ML model to perform multiple RAN related tasks. MTL jointly learns multiple related tasks using a single model. MTL draws inspiration from human learning, where individuals frequently leverage knowledge acquired from prior tasks to facilitate the learning of a new task.",
        "The traditional process of radiation therapy is usually separated into two phases: the planning phase and the treatment phase. The treatment phase itself normally consists of multiple treatment sessions where the malignant tissue is radiated. In the planning phase, a CT scan is performed on the patient and, based on the result, the area to be radiated is planned for the subsequent radiation ses-sions in the treatment phase. It is therefore crucial that in the radiation session the position of the patient is the same as the position in the planning phase.\nWith the introduction of head-mounted displays such as the Microsoft Hololens 5 , Augmented Reality (AR) has gained traction in medical research, specifically in surgical applications such as training [12, 16] and intervention [19, 4, 20] . Medical experts questioned about these systems have shown overwhelmingly positive opinions [12, 30] . However, the application of AR to guide patient positioning is so scarce that there is no related works in the recent literature reviews [9, 23, 39] . AR for patient positioning could have the potential benefit of assisting the operators by the interactive real-time visualization of the actual patient's position compared to the desired patient position (Fig. 1 ).\nIn the past decade, there has also been a growth of works that take advantage of consumer-level depth or RGB-Depth (RGB-D) cameras (e.g. Microsoft Kinect) In c, the red model mesh represents the tracked body of the patient, and the blue model mesh shows its desired pose. Our method also provides numerical feedback on the corner of the AR image in the form of rotational and translational error. [42, 22, 21] which are very useful in AR applications. These sensors are affordable and also provide a real-time depth map of the scene and a corresponding color image.\nIn other words they can give a dense real-time geometrical image of the scene rather than the sparse pose estimation that is possible using e.g. fiducial markers. Simultaneously, research on fiducial planar markers has proposed fast, robust and cheap methods for precise camera pose tracking. They do not need special equipment except for a color camera and a set of printed markers. These give fiducial planar marker detectors such as ArUco [13, 31] many advantages with respect to the traditional infraredbased markers.\nTaking advantage of these two recent technologies, this paper proposes a novel method for assisted patient positioning which is able to simultaneously track the patient and the treatment environment.",
        "Metaverse is currently gaining attention as an alternative platform for human interaction in the virtual world [1] , [2] . In parallel, brain-computer interface (BCI) [3] , [4] is a technology to convey user intention by decoding brain signals of user's certain thoughts (e.g., imagined speech, imagined movements or visual imagery) [5] - [7] . These two technologies may seem unrelated between each other, however, may create a new era of human interaction when elaborately combined. Since virtual platform holds few restrictions in changing the surrounding environments or the appearance of the avatars, it can serve as a platform to reflect human thoughts or even dreams in the metaverse world [8] .\nImagined speech, which is a first person imagery of utterance without emitting an audible vocal output [9] ), is one of the emerging paradigms in the field of intuitive BCI [5] , [10] to deliver the commands or wishes to the virtual world. Conventional BCI paradigms such as steady-state visual evoked potentials and event-related potentials have shown robust performance in conveying user intention via brain signals [11] , [12] , however, lack the intuitiveness to deliver user's direct thoughts because they require additional process (such as receiving stimulus or user training) [13] . Since imagined speech directly contains the word or sentence the user wants to say, it would be the most direct and convenient medium of BCI communication [5] . Similar to the current speech recognition systems that are mostly commercialized [14] , imagined speech based communication system may be the future method to communicate or make commands only by imagining words [13] , [15] . Here, we call the imagined speech based communication system as brain-to-speech (BTS) system, which converts user's brain signal of imagined speech into an audible speech (see Fig.",
        "Although frequency range 2 (FR2) [1] offers a practical solution to the problem of contiguous bandwidth that is needed for 5G mobile networks to fulfill the steep increase in user demand, it introduces further challenges to radio propagation such as higher free-space path loss and penetration loss [2] . This leads to rapid signal degradation in mobile environments where there are many static and moving obstacles. It also particularly pronounces the problem of inter-cell interference [3] , which besides being high in cell boundary regions is now also subject to rapid increase. Hence, a high number of mobility failures are experienced.\nConditional handover (CHO) has been introduced in [4 ] as an alternate to baseline handover to improve mobility robustness. In CHO, handover preparation and execution is decoupled by introducing a conditional procedure. Hereby, the handover towards the prepared target cell is prepared early by the serving cell but random access is performed later by the user equipment (UE), when the link quality is sufficient. However, even if the mobility parameters chosen from a search space yield optimal mobility performance, CHO still brings about the problem of a significant signaling overhead [3] . In FR2, particularly there is a very high signaling overhead due to a high number of handovers due to dense cell deployment.\nFor 5G-Advanced networks [5] , an alternate handover mechanism to address this issue is under discussion [6] , [7] . Fast CHO (FCHO) permits the UE to retain its prepared target cells after a handover, and later reuse them to autonomously execute handovers. This significantly reduces the signaling overhead by saving the preparation of multiple target cells. At the same time mobility failures are also reduced because handovers are now prepared relatively faster and can be executed immediately when a better cell becomes available.\nOn the UE architecture side, another solution that has been proposed is multi-panel UE (MPUE), i.e., a UE equipped with more than one spatially distinct antenna panels [8] , [9] . It offers a higher directional gain on each panel as compared to an isotropic UE that has a single antenna panel with an isotropic radiation pattern. Furthermore, if the MPUE can be made to communicate with one or more panels oriented towards the serving cell then the inter-cell interference from the neighboring cells can be significantly suppressed.\nIn this paper, the mobility performance of FCHO in terms of mobility key performance indicators (KPIs) and signaling overhead is investigated. The mobility performance is elaborated for two different MPUE signal measurement schemes that are addressed in 3GPP standardization [10] . It is important to understand the mobility performance of FCHO for advanced UE architectures since both are an essential part of 5G-Advanced [5] . To the best of the authors' knowledge, the mobility performance of FCHO has not been investigated in literature before.",
        "The Q-learning algorithm introduced in [28] is a highly celebrated approach to reinforcement learning, that has evolved over the past decades to form part of the solution to complex optimal control problems. It was originally designed to compute the state-action value function (known as the Q-function). This early work considered the discounted-cost optimal control problem for Markov decision processes (MDPs), in the tabular setting so that the function class spans all functions.\nThe ultimate goal then and now is to approximate the Q-function within a restricted function class, notably neural networks, though much of the theory is restricted to a linearly parameterized function class. Counterexamples show that conditions on the function class are required in general, even in a linear function approximation setting [2, 27, 9] . Criteria for stability based on sufficient exploration are contained in the recent work [18] .\nMoreover, when convergent, the limit of Q-learning or DQN solves a \"projected Bellman equation\" (see (11) ), but we know little about the implication of this conclusion. These concerns have motivated new ways of thinking about how to approximate a Q-function.\nOne alternative is GQ learning, based on a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with an objective similar to the mean-square Bellman error [25] . Recently a more exact stochastic gradient descent algorithm was introduced in [1] with full stability analysis. These results present a significant advancement but come with two drawbacks: the objective is non-convex, so there is no reason to believe the algorithm will converge to the global minimum. Moreover, it remains difficult to interpret the solution of the global minimum. If the Bellman error is small in an L 2 sense, where the L 2 norm depends on training data, what does this tell us about the performance of the ultimate feedback policy?\nThe linear programming (LP) approach to optimal control pioneered by Manne [15] has inspired alternative approaches to RL and approximate dynamic programming. The earliest such work was found in [23] , with error bounds appearing in [5, 4, 11] . Model-free algorithms appeared in [16, 12, 13] and [17, Ch. 5] , where the term convex Q-learning (CvxQ) was coined. In parallel came logistic Q-learning [3] , which solves a regularized dual of the LP in [12] . There is however a gap in the settings: CvxQ was developed for deterministic control systems, while logistic Q-learning treats MDPs. Also, the stochastic setting is so far restricted to tabular [3] or linearly factorable MDPs [20] . Theory for CvxQ has few restrictions, beyond the limitation to deterministic control systems.\nLP approaches are attractive because we obtain by design a convergent algorithm. Moreover, the L \u221e -framework is more likely to lead to an interpretable solution, since performance bounds on the resulting feedback policy can be obtained through Lyapunov function techniques [5, 11] . The main contributions are summarized here: i) Convex Q-learning for optimal control is introduced in a stochastic environment for the first time. It is found that the constraint region is bounded subject to a persistence of excitation, generalizing the conclusions obtained recently for deterministic optimal control problems [13] . Several approaches to approximating the solution to the convex program are proposed and analyzed.\nii) Prop. 2.5 implies a surprising connection between CvxQ and standard Q-learning.\niii) Techniques are introduced to obtain the rate of convergence in a mean-square sense-see Prop. A.1.\nComparison with existing literature. The new algorithms and some of the analysis might be anticipated from the theory for deterministic control systems in [13] . Prop. 2.5 is new (and was initially surprising to us) even in the deterministic setting. The variance analysis surveyed in Prop. A.1 is novel, resting on recent CLT theory from [24] to obtain an exact formula for the asymptotic covariance. Complementary results appeared in [21] , motivated by MDP LP relaxations. Conclusions in this prior work is based on i.i.d. samples of trajectories, designed to permit application of Hoeffding's inequality to obtain sample complexity bounds for constraint-sampled LPs.",
        "LLMs have increasingly been employed to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Specifically, they have been applied to tasks that require interactions with environments (Yang et al., 2023a; Yao et al., 2022a; Shridhar et al., 2020; Zelikman et al., 2022) and those tasks that can benefit from utilizing tools such as web search and code execution (Mialon et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023c) . In approaching these tasks, there is typically a desired workflow, or plan of actions based on heuristics that could improve the efficiency of task solving (Kim et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023a) . A common practice in the context of LLMs, such as ReAct (Yao et al., 2022b) and the vast customization of GPTs, is to write a single prompt that instructs the models to follow a desired procedure to solve the task (Dohan et al., 2022) . The LLM is called iteratively with the same instruction, along with previous actions and feedback from tools/environments. This relies on LLMs' innate capability to determine the current task-solving status and perform subsequent actions autonomously. Despite the impressive abilities of LLMs, it is still unrealistic to expect LLMs to always make the correct judgment of the status of current progress. It is also almost impossible to reliably track these judgments and their decisions of subsequent action trajectory. Given these considerations, Init and End state are basic components of state machines, and states like Observe, Solve, Verify, Error can be adaptable across various tasks. When reaching a state, a sequence of output functions defined is executed (e.g., M i \u2192 E means to first call the model and then call the SQL/Bash execution). Execution outcomes are indicated by red arrows for failures and green for successes.\nTransition to different states is based on specific rules. For example, at a success 'Submit' command, the model transits to End state.\nwe pose the research question: How can we exert more precise control and guidance over LLMs?\nIn this paper, we propose StateFlow, a new framework that models LLM workflows as state machines.",
        "The many-decades effort to understand, and then replicate, the brain's computational paradigm(s) is far from complete. Although neuroscientific experiment and theory have revealed much about the elements of neural computation, refining and combining them into a cohesive, widely accepted paradigm remains the subject of intensive ongoing research.\nOne line of research targets deep, hierarchical spiking neural networks (SNNs) [53] , similar in structure to convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. Much of the SNN research targets improved energy efficiency when implementing supervised classification. In contrast, the research reported here does not address problems for which state-ofthe-art machine learning already excels. Rather, the goal is to tackle a problem for which conventional machine learning methods are less adept, but for which neuromorphic methods appear to be well-suited: online unsupervised clustering.\nClustering partitions a set of input patterns into groups where the members of a cluster are more similar to each other than to members of other clusters. An online implementation consumes and processes inputs item-by-item; there is no buffering of inputs for deferred processing. This feature supports realtime processing of streaming inputs in a natural way. Because clustering is achieved online without metadata, if input data patterns change at a macro-level, then the clustering function adapts by dynamically reformulating the clusters.\nThis paper demonstrates that online unsupervised clustering is achievable via a simple, neuromorphic paradigm that can be described as a centroid-based clustering method. Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is at the core of the online clustering mechanism. STDP operates independently at each synapse, using only locally available information.",
        "Action detection is a challenging computer vision problem which targets at finding precise temporal boundaries of actions occurring in an untrimmed video. Many studies on action detection focus on videos with sparse and well-separated instances of action [4, 23, 25] . For instance, action detection algorithms on popular datasets like THUMOS [12] and Activi-tyNet [2] generally learn representations for single actions in a video. However, in daily life, human actions are continuous and can be very dense. Every minute is filled with potential actions to be detected and labelled. The methods designed for sparsely labelled datasets are hard to generalize to such real-world scenarios.\nTowards this research direction, several methods [9, 17, 18] have been proposed to model complex temporal relationships and to process datasets like Charades [19] , TSU [7] and Mul-tiTHUMOS [24] . Those datasets encompassing real-world challenges share the following characteristics: Firstly, the actions are densely labelled and background instances are rare in these videos compared to sparsely labelled datasets. Secondly, the video has rich temporal structure and a set of actions occurring together often follows a well defined temporal pattern. For example, drinking from bottle always happens after taking a bottle and reading a book also related to opening a book in Fig 1 . Finally, humans are great at multitasking, multiple actions can co-occur at the same time. For example, reading book while drinking water.\nExisting methods have mostly focused on modelling the variation of visual cues across time locally [15] or globally [17] within a video. However, these methods take into account the temporal information without any further semantics. Real-world videos contain many complex actions with inherent relationships between action classes at the same time steps or across distant time steps (see Fig. 1 ). Modelling such class-temporal relationships can be extremely useful for locating actions in those videos.\nTo this end, we introduce Class-Temporal Relational Network (CTRN) to harness the relationships among the action classes in a video.",
        "Deep learning models are being deployed for a large variety of tasks. Even though a lot of these tasks do not primarily require decisions to be confident, e.g. advertisement or content suggestions, regulators around the world are expecting companies to build safer and trustable artificial intelligent (AI) systems (e.g. the European Union proposal for AI regulation [1] ). Other AI tasks, especially for critical infrastructures, need to be robust and safe at their core before being deployed in the real world, e.g. secured communication systems, radio surveillance, navigation systems. Building safe deep learning models which can be trusted in the real world is a complex objective. One could think of gathering enough data, but that solution is either too costly, impossible due to confidentiality issues or simply impossible. Indeed a lot of tasks are constantly evolving, e.g. face masks after the covid-19 pandemic and their effect on face recognition systems (c.f. [2] ). One could think of modeling the data, but this is not possible in all situations. On an ID sample (top), both give the correct prediction with a large confidence, however on an OoD sample (bottom), a standard neural network predicts a 5 with 81% confidence. This confidence drops to 0.4%, when the neural network is trained with TrustGAN.\nOne solution is to build a deep learning model which is as successful on a task as possible, but which also is able to raise a flag or abstain if it is not confident enough. Such a deep learning network returns now both a decision and an estimated confidence on the decision. This confidence needs to be robust to rare samples in the training set and more importantly to out-of-distribution (OoD) samples. These samples are data unknown to the network, e.g. if building a classifier to recognise helicopters from planes, a realistic OoD sample could be the image of a bird. Then a robust AI system has to return a low confidence for such an image. Gathering OoD samples or worse OoD data sets is very tedious and most of the time impossible, for similar reasons as the ones discussed above for training data sets.\nStandard training pipelines for deep learning models do not focus on the estimation of the confidence on OoD. Instead these pipelines focus on getting the best performances on the training data set. That being said, most machine learning models still output an estimation of the confidence on their decision, e.g. the maximum class probability (MCP). The estimation is known to be unreliable and overestimated (see for example [3] ). We show an example of such a flaw in figure 1 , where a number classifier, efficient at its task, robustly classifies the image of a pangolin as the digit 5 (red boxes).\nWe present here TrustGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN [4] ) pipeline targeting trustness and confidence. The goal of this pipeline is to attack the confidence estimated by a target model in order to improve upon it. We present the effect TrustGAN can have on in-distribution (ID) and OoD samples in figure 1 (green boxes). The idea of the pipeline starts with the understanding that since OoD samples are hard or impossible to gather and train on, then we could leave a GAN learning to produce them. Through these generated adversarial samples, the target network would learn both to be efficient at its target task and to understand what ID samples look like.",
        "In the last few years, diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021) have achieved significant success across diverse domains of generative modeling, including image generation (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Karras et al., 2022) , text-toimage synthesis (Rombach et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022) , audio/speech synthesis (Kim et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023) , graph generation (Xu et al., 2022; Vignac et al., 2022) , and 3D content generation (Poole et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023) . Substantial empirical evidence attests to the ability of diffusion models to generate diverse and novel high-quality samples (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021; Nichol et al., 2021) , underscoring their powerful capability of abstracting and comprehending the characteristics of the training data.\nDiffusion models posit a forward diffusion process {z t } t\u2208[0,T ] that gradually introduces Gaussian noise to a data point x, resulting in a transition distribution q t (z t |x) = N (z t |\u03b1 t x, \u03c3 2 t I).

        "The rapid expansion of online social media platforms has led to a rise in misinformation, undermining public trust in truth and science. Unlike traditional media, where content is often rigorously fact-checked, the interactive nature of social media accelerates the spread of fake news through commenting and sharing, magnifying its impact. This makes detecting and countering fake news on these platforms both challenging and crucial [A\u00efmeur et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2024] .\nTo tackle this challenge, abundant machine-learning methods are proposed for fake news detection. Besides utilizing single-modal or multi-modal detectors to extract features from content [Dong et al., 2023; Hua et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024] , there is a growing interest in conceptualizing the online social network as a graph structure to leverage the rich social context [Phan et al., How to launch a general attack? propagation and dispersion tree, etc. The diversity in the graph types poses challenges for launching a general black-box adversarial attack on fake news detectors based on different graphs. Yin et al., 2024] . Among existing studies, the user-news bipartite graph is commonly used for detectors to model user engagement [Nguyen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023a; Su et al., 2023] . Besides, the news engagement graph can be constructed to explore relations between news directly [Wu and Hooi, 2023] . Instead of capturing information in the global network, the news's local propagation structure is also investigated. The news-post propagation and dispersion tree [Bian et al., 2020] are constructed to aggregate information from two directions, while the news-user propagation tree [Dou et al., 2021] is constructed to capture user-aware in the propagation structure. Due to the diversity of the graph construction, Graph Neural Network (GNN) is allowed to learn distinctive news embeddings from different perspectives for news classification. Despite their effectiveness in detecting fake news, these detectors have increasingly been found to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks [Wang et al., 2023a] . This vulnerability may be utilized to manipulate public opinion or gain financial benefits. Therefore, it is critical to investigate adversarial attacks on GNN-based fake news detectors to assess and enhance their robustness.\nExisting adversarial attacks on GNN are primarily categorized into two types: edge perturbation and node injection.",
        "Sound source localization (SSL) aims at estimating a pose/location of sound sources. With an increasing popularity in installing smart speakers in home environments, source location provides additional knowledge that could enable a variety of applications such as monitoring human activities in daily life [1] , speech enhancement [2] and human-robot interaction [3] . SSL is an active research topic for which various signal processing methods have been proposed [3, 4] . These dataindependent methods work well under strict assumptions [4] , e.g. high signal-to-noise ratio, known number of sources, low reverberation, etc. Such ideal conditions hardly hold true in real-world applications and usually require special treatments [5] [6] [7] [8] . Recently, data-driven approaches and in particular deep learning have outperformed classical signal processing methods for various audio tasks [9, 10] including SSL [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .\nMultiple network architectures have been proposed to localize sound sources. An advantage of these methods, apart from their ability to adapt to challenging acoustic conditions and microphone configurations, is that they can be trained to solve multiple tasks at the same time like simultaneous localization and classification of sounds [13] . However, a significant downside is that they require lots of training data, which is expensive to gather and label [19, 20] Acoustic simulators are an appealing solution as they can abundantly generate high-quality labeled datasets. However, models trained on synthetic data as a source domain can suffer from a critical drop in performance when exposed to real-world data as the target domain. This is due to acoustic conditions which are outside the distribution of the synthetic training dataset [21, 22] , thus resulting in a domain shift [23] .\nRecently, there have been several works about domain adaptation for SSL. For example, [24, 25] proposed unsupervised methods using entropy minimization of the localization output. However, such methods are not suitable to our problem because entropy minimization encourages the prediction of only a single source whereas we must cater to multiple outputs. In this context, [19] has proposed two adaptation methods compatible for multiple SSL; (m1) a weakly supervised method in which the number of sources is provided for real-world data; (m2) an unsupervised method based on Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) [26] which intends to align latent feature distributions for synthetic and real-world domains by adding a discriminative model at a certain feature level of the localization model. They reported that m1 increased the localization performance whereas m2 did not yield significant improvements. However, adversarial methods such as [26] are popular outside SSL. For example, [27] proposes an adversarial domain adaptation method for the semantic segmentation problem in computer vision. Moreover, similar approaches have been successfully applied to other audio tasks such as Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) [28] and Sound Event Detection (SED) [29] .",
        "League of Legends (LoL), a popular computer game developed by Riot Games, is currently the most widely played Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) [3] game in the world. In 2019, there were eight million concurrent players daily [14] , and the player base has continued to grow since its release in 2009. A core aspect of LoL is competitive ranked gameplay. In typical ranked gameplay, ten human players are matched together to form two teams of approximately equal skill. These two teams, consisting of five players each, battle against each other to destroy the opposing team's base.\nFair matchmaking is crucial for player experience [31] . In 2019, Riot Games stated that ranked matchmaking should be as fair as possible [11] . This goal has persisted throughout the history of the game. In 2020, Riot Games stated that some of their main goals for the year were to preserve competitive integrity [12] and improve matchmaking quality [13] for ranked games. In order to create fair matches between players of approximately equivalent skill level, matchmaking is determined using an Elo rating system, similar to the one originally used by chess players [26] . Although this matchmaking system has improved in recent years (c.f., [10, 11, 13] ), it does not consider players' champion selections when forming matches. LoL has over 150 playable characters, known as champions, that have their own unique playstyles and abilities [7] . Players select a champion at the start of every match after the matchmaking algorithm has formed teams. However, players will often perform better on some champions than on others due to their differing levels of mechanical expertise, which is defined as a player's knowledge of their champion's abilities and interactions [8] . Higher levels of mechanical expertise on particular champions allow players to make quicker and better judgments, which are essential in the game's fast paced environment. Since mechanical expertise plays such a large impact on a player's own performance, it can therefore cause a similar impact on the match's outcome.\nIn this paper, we introduce a machine learning model based on a deep neural network (DNN) that can predict ranked match outcomes based on players' experience on their selected champion (i.e., player-champion experience).",
        "Since its introduction the Transformer architecture [66] has become the dominant architecture in natural language processing tasks, replacing previously popular recurrent architectures. The vision transformer [16] (ViT) is a simple adaptation of transformers to computer vision tasks like image classification: the input image is divided into non-overlapping patches, which are fed to a vanilla transformer architecture, after a linear patch projection layer. In contrast to networks built from convolutional layers, transformers offer parallel processing and a complete field-of-view in a single layer. Along with other attention-based architectures, see e.g. [4, 7] , transformers have recently substantially influenced the design of computer vision architectures. Many modern architectures in computer vision directly inherit parts of their design from this work, or are at least inspired by the recent findings resulting from transformers [7, 16, 62] . As a result, significant improvements have been observed on different computer vision tasks, ranging from ob- ject detection and segmentation [18] and video analysis [1, 19] to image generation [9, 31] .\nWhile vision transformers have led to considerable progress, the optimization of their design and training procedures have only been explored to a limited extent. In this paper, we offer three insights on training vision transformers.",
        "Screening for colorectal cancer is highly effective, as early detection is within reach, making this disease one of the most preventable. Today's standard of care screening method is optical colonoscopy, which searches the colon for mucosal abnormalities, such as polyps. However, performing a thorough examination of the entire colon surface using optical colonoscopy is challenging, which may lead to a lower polyp detection rate. Recent studies have shown that approximately 25% of polyps are routinely missed during colonoscopies [1] .\nThe success (diagnostic accuracy) of a colonoscopy procedure is highly operator dependent. It varies based on the performing physician skills, experience, vigilance, fatigue, and more. To ensure high procedure quality, various quality metrics are measured and monitored. E.g., the Withdrawal Time (time from the colonoscope reaching cecum to removal of the instrument from the patient) metric was shown to be highly correlated to Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) [6, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18] . Another quality metric -Cecal Intubation Rate (proportion of colonoscopies in which the cecum is intubated) -is considered important to ensure good colon coverage.\nMost of these existing metrics are relatively easy to compute, but can provide only limited data on the quality of a specific procedure, and are typically used aggregatively for multiple sessions. Some studies [14] suggest that there are other factors that impact the polyp detection rate. For example, one may wish to distinguish between a good and bad colonoscope motion patterns, or assess the style of the examination. The hypothesis is that a better inspection style yields more informative visual input, which results in a better diagnostic accuracy.\nIn this work we propose a novel quantitative quality metric for colonoscopy, based on the automatic analysis of the induced video feed. This metric is computed locally in time, measuring how informative and helpful for colon inspection a local video segment is. As this instantaneous quality is very subjective and difficult to formulate, human annotation is problematic and ill-defined. Instead, we let an ML model build a meaningful visual data representation in a fully unsupervised way, and use it to construct a metric highly correlated with the clinical outcome. First, we learn visual representations of colonoscopy video frames using contrastive self-supervised learning. Then, we perform cluster analysis on these representations and construct a learned aggregation of these cluster assignments, bearing a strong correlation with polyp detection, which can serve as an indicator for \"good-quality\" video segments.",
        "Despite the significant investment in intrusion detection systems over the past decade, the average time to identify and contain a security breach is 323 days, and its average cost is $4.35 million, according to the IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 2022 [48] . This growing problem highlights the need for intrusion detection techniques that can identify unauthorised interaction within compromised systems.\nHoneypots are one of the most powerful cybersecurity tools that can be employed to address this challenge [51] . Designed to mimic real devices or resources, honeypots are of no use to legitimate users and thus more likely to attract the attention of intruders reconnoitring a system. They can be monitored for access or other forms of interaction as a reliable indicator of a breach. More sophisticated honeypots allow for greater engagement, potentially yielding intelligence regarding an intruder's intent, tools or malicious payloads [22] . Many organizations conduct research into and commercialize honeypots and related cyber deception technology, including Attivo, Countercraft, Thinkst and Penten.\nFake documents or honeyfiles [61] are a particularly useful type of honeypot: documents are ubiquitous and often contain valuable information such as intellectual property and financial data. Honeyfiles are easy to deploy and can be crafted to contain topics from sensitive documents or content that matches the interests of suspected threats [47, 57] . Honeyfiles placed in a document repository or file system can be monitored for access or exfiltration as a breach detection mechanism. The choice of topic or search terms used by an adversary to look for documents in a repository can also provide insight into their intent and interests [53] . The key to successful honeyfile use is realism, in the sense that the appearance and content of a honeyfile accurately mimic real documents.",
        "Physical-layer authentication relies on detecting and identifying unique characteristics embedded in over-the-air radio signals, thus enabling the identification of the hardware of the transmitting source [1] , [2] . Wireless Physical-layer authentication is also known as radio fingerprinting when referring to the challenge of both detecting and extracting features from the received signal (fingerprint), which can uniquely identify the transmitting source [3] , [4] .\nPhysical-layer authentication can significantly enhance the security and privacy of wireless channels in two adversarial scenarios: (i) spoofing; and, (ii) replay attacks. The former involves a rogue transmitting source attempting to impersonate a legitimate one, while the latter assumes the adversary being able to re-transmit previously eavesdropped messages [5] . Despite spoofing detection can be achieved by authenticating the transmitting source with standard cryptographic techniques (e.g., digital signatures), in many scenarios involving massive deployments (e.g., IoT), difficult to reach devices (e.g., satellites), or when the cryptography-induced overhead is considered excessive, digital signatures might be inefficient [6] . Alternative solutions could involve crowd-sourcing, i.e., crosschecking context information to validate the transmitting source [7] , [8] . Replay attacks can be even more difficult to detect, being dependent on specific protocol flaws: the adversary re-transmits encrypted information, which will be considered as valid if not timestamped. Both spoofing and replay attacks can be prevented if the receiver can authenticate the hardware of the transmitting source [9] .\nMany researchers have already undertaken the challenge of extracting fingerprints and developing effective detection algorithms to extract and match the fingerprints (see Sec. II for an overview). The cited tasks have been mainly achieved by resorting to dedicated hardware at the receiver side, featuring high sampling resolution and better signal quality. Indeed, Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) played a major role as an enabling technology for radio fingerprinting. Specifically, SDRs provide both high-resolution bandwidth (thus exposing the features of the transmitting source) and high signal-tonoise ratio (thus facilitating the extraction of the features to the back-end algorithms). Unfortunately, radio noise still represents the major issue for all the state-of-the-art solutions. Indeed, the fingerprint of the transmitting source is mixeddrown, in many cases-with the noise of the radio channel. Therefore, discriminating between the needed features and the noise brings back the problem of developing effective algorithms to achieve the cited objective.\nRecently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been adopted for radio fingerprinting in several scenarios, such as ADS-B, WiFi, and Zigbee, to name a few [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] . The idea behind the adoption of CNNs relies on exploiting their multidimensional mapping during the learning process to detect and extract reliable radio fingerprints. However, all of the recent contributions took into account terrestrial links, only.\nAlthough achieving interesting performance, there are still some open fundamental questions related to CNNs, such as the intrinsic time-stationarity nature of the CNNs and how the wireless channel (in terms of attenuation and fading) affects the learning and detection processes [13] . Recent results [13] based on real measurements on terrestrial wireless links confirmed that the wireless channel significantly impacts the classification accuracy (up to 80%), thus confirming the need for more effective classification techniques.",
        "In Figure 1 we show a 'Real vs. Fake' game, in which a mix of 'real' images are collected from the real world and 'fake' images are generated by our GAN model. The goal is to guess which image is real and which one has been generated by the proposed GAN model. Now you can check your answers below 1 . This should be a very challenging and difficult task, considering the recent progress in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [1] .\nIn this paper, we aim to address the challenging layout-toimage translation task, which has a wide range of real-world applications such as content generation and image editing [2] , [3] , [4] . This task has been widely investigated in recent years [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] . For example, Park et al. [5] proposed the GauGAN model with a novel spatially-adaptive normalization to generate realistic images from semantic layouts. Tang et al. [9] proposed the LGGAN framework with a novel local generator for generating realistic small objects and detailed local texture. Despite the interesting exploration Fig. 1 : 'Real vs. Fake' game: Can you guess which image is real and which has been generated by the proposed DPGAN? of these methods, we can still observe blurriness and artifacts in their generated results because the existing methods lack an effective semantic dependency modeling to maintain the semantic information of the input layout, causing intra-object semantic inconsistencies such as the fence, buses, and pole generated by GauGAN in Figure 2 .\nTo solve this limitation, we propose a novel Double Pooling GAN (DPGAN) and a novel Double Pooling Module (DPM). The proposed DPM consists of two sub-modules, i.e., Squareshape Pooling Module (SPM) and Rectangle-shape Pooling Module (RPM). In particular, SPM aims to capture shortrange and local semantic dependencies, leading pixels within the same object to be correlated. Simultaneously, RPM aims to capture long-range and global semantic dependencies from both horizontal and vertical directions. Finally, we propose seven image-level and feature-level fusion strategies to effectively combine the outputs of both SPM and RPM for generating high-quality and semantically-consistent images.",
        "Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown human-level performance in various applications, such as in healthcare [1, 2, 3, 4] ,\nsurveillance [5, 6, 7, 8] , and machine translation [9, 10] . However, particularly in the healthcare domain, most intelligent diagnosis systems are limited to diagnosis of only one or a few diseases and cannot be easily extended once deployed, and therefore cannot diagnose all diseases of certain tissue or organ (e.g., skin or lung) as medical specialists do. Since collecting data of all (e.g., skin or lung) diseases is challenging due to various reasons (e.g., privacy and limited data sharing), it is impractical to train an intelligent system diagnosing all diseases at once. One possible solution is to make the intelligent system have the continual or lifelong learning ability, such that it can continually learn to diagnose more and more diseases without resourcing (or resourcing few) original data of previously learned diseases [11] . Such continual learning of new classes may also appear in other applications such as in automated retail stores [12] . However, current intelligent models are characterised by catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge when learning new classes [13, 14, 15] .\nResearchers have recently proposed multiple types of continual learning approaches to reduce catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge particularly in deep learning models [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] . The overall objective is to help the updated classifier accurately recognize both new and old classes, when only data of new classes and few (or even no) data of old classes are available during classifier updating. However, almost all existing approaches modify the feature extraction part of the classifiers either in parameter values or in structures during continual learning of new classes. In contrast, humans seem to learn new knowledge by adding memory of the learned new information without modifying the (e.g., visual) perceptual pathway. Therefore, one possible cause to catastrophic forgetting in existing models is the change in the feature extraction part (corresponding to the perceptual pathway in human brains) when learning new knowledge.",
        "The tour itinerary recommendation is a popular and challenging problem, with significant impact for tourism and other domains such as transportation and logistics [1] . The tour itinerary recommendation problem has garnered immense interest in both academia and industry. This problem contains both aspects of an recommendation problem as well as a planning problem. From the recommendation perspective, there are elements of top-K item recommendation and learning to rank, where we aim to recommend a subset of most relevant POIs to a user in the form of an itinerary. From the operation research perspective, it is akin to a constrained optimization problem, where we need to maximize the utility that a user obtains from the planned itinerary while ensuring that the itinerary adheres to certain time and location constraints.\nIn this paper, we discuss the tour itinerary recommendation problem from both perspectives of a recommendation and operation research problem, particularly on how recent advances on natural language processing have advanced research in this area. In particular, we discuss how language models have been adapted for the task of tour itinerary recommendation such as how word embedding techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe are used for POI representation learning and transformer-based models like BERT are used for next POI and itinerary recommendation.",
        "Operational test and evaluation (T&E) is a critical aspect of systems engineering. There is a pressing need for messaging standards that support operational T&E of machine learning (ML) applications [1] . This need is especially exposed for edge ML-those applications which exist as embedded subsystems within micro-controllers or other hardware in deployed systems like industrial controls, robots, unmanned vehicles, satellites, and more [2] , [3] . Operational T&E of edge ML applications is needed to assess potential degradation due to lifecycle phenomena like concept drift [4] , [5] and adversarial attack [6] . While there are calls in the literature for new test architectures for ML [7] - [10] , luckily, the automatic test community developed the IEEE Standard 1671 (IEEE Std 1671), named the Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML), for similar, albeit different, uses [11] .\nATML is an XML-based standard used for exchanging Automatic Test System (ATS) data. ATML provides a format for describing, storing, and exchanging data about test and measurement systems [12] . It was developed for general use [13] , but is most widely applied to electronic systems like compute hardware and signal processors/generators. For this reason, a key extension of ATML was integration with IEEE Standard 1641 to include standards for sending signals (e.g., cosine waves) and receiving/handling related test results.\nAn important innovation of these signal-related extensions was to provide standards for defining the information within test signals. With ML applications, however, the information is rarely definable using a parameterized function like a sine or cosine wave, but rather requires transacting datasets between the test tool and the unit under test (UUT), i.e., the predictive model of the ML subsystem. In addition to this novelty, ML applications are often software-dominant. While ATML has been integrated with software architectures, that is different that using ATML to test software-dominant systems [14] . These novelties beg the question of whether or not IEEE Std 1671 can be extended to address automatic test of ML applications, or if a new standard is needed all together.\nIn this paper, we explore the ability of IEEE Std 1671 to address the novelties of ML applications, including the integration of test data payloads and software-based tests. We model a variety of tests, including cross-validation and adversarial testing, using the XML schemas provided by the ATML standard. By providing this case study, researchers and practitioners are given a basis which can be adapted to suit their particular application. Our results suggest that only minor extensions of ATML may be necessary, depending on design decisions regarding the specification of test data, and that a new IEEE 1671.X standard may be sufficient to address them.\nImportantly, while there are other standards and frameworks that are specifically designed for ML, like the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) [15] or Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) [16] , they are focused on specifications of ML models themselves, not of the tests of those models."

        "Stochastic models find applications across various fields such as ecology, genetics, economics, and engineering. While closed form solutions exist for some of the simplest drift and diffusion functions, numerical methods are essential for solving complex stochastic models, including the Fokker-Planck equation. The global dynamic behavior of nonlinear systems with noise is formally described by the evolution of the probability density function (PDF) through deterministic and diffusion processes, satisfying the Fokker-Planck (FP) partial differential equation [19]. The FP system, which bridges stochastic and deterministic dynamics, has been widely applied in physics, chemistry, biology, and finance [8, 9, 19, 20, 22].\n\nThis article focuses on the FP equations corresponding to stochastic differential equations, particularly the multidimensional model defined by:\n\\[dX_t = b(X_t, t)dt + \\sigma(X_t, t)dW_t\\]\nwhere \\(X_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) represents the state variable, \\(dW_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^l\\) denotes the Wiener process, and \\(\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times l}\\) is a full-rank dispersion matrix. The state of the stochastic process can be described by a statistical distribution, and the evolution of this distribution is modeled by the FP equation. Several researchers have developed numerical solutions for the FP equations. The Chang-Cooper (CC) scheme, introduced in 1970 by Chang and Cooper, is a popular method for solving the linear FP equation [9]. The CC scheme is known for preserving essential properties of the original problem, such as positivity and conservation of total probability. Subsequent advancements include high-order finite difference schemes and solutions for nonlinear cases [13], as well as discussions on finite element schemes [22].\n\nVarious techniques, including semi-analytic approaches, have been employed to solve the FP equation. Examples include the Adomian decomposition method [12], variational iteration method [23], and finite difference schemes with spline collocation methods [21]. Additionally, fast algorithms and specific schemes tailored for different scenarios have been proposed [10, 17, 17]. Ongoing research in 2020 continues to explore numerical solutions for stochastic models and the FP equation, covering topics such as preserving nonnegativity and mass conservation, dealing with piecewise-constant drift, and addressing fractional Fokker-Planck Equations [1, 2, 8, 11, 25].\n\nThis work aims to solve the FP equation with both linear and nonlinear drift vectors and constant diffusion tensors. By doing so, the study focuses on the Gaussian distribution for the FP equation, a parabolic type differential equation that satisfies positivity and conservation conditions. A two-level algorithm is presented, incorporating coarsening by a factor-of-three strategy on staggered grids, along with backward time-difference schemes BDF1 and BDF2 for first and second-order accuracy, respectively. The Chang-Cooper discretization scheme is utilized to ensure second-order accuracy, positiveness, and conservation of total probability.\n\nThe following sections provide a detailed breakdown of the work: Section 2 introduces the Fokker-Planck equation, Section 3 explains the Chang-Cooper discretization scheme, Section 4 presents a two-level scheme with inter-grid transfer operators, Section 5 reports numerical results, and the concluding section offers final remarks.",
        "Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly those incorporating low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, are crucial for achieving ubiquitous connectivity [1], [2].  LEO satellites offer significant advantages over traditional MEO and GEO high-throughput satellites [6]-[8], including reduced propagation delays and lower deployment costs [3]-[5]. While current systems primarily connect ground stations (GSs) to individual satellites, leveraging multiple LEO satellites in coordinated swarms offers enhanced flexibility and scalability [9].\n\nA key advantage of satellite swarms lies in their ability to form large virtual antenna arrays, enabling substantial spectral efficiency gains through increased spatial separation [10]-[12].  However, implementing conventional MIMO schemes necessitates complete instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and inter-satellite coordination for joint beamforming.  This is impractical due to short channel coherence times caused by high orbital velocities and relatively long propagation delays in both ground-to-satellite and inter-satellite links.  This paper demonstrates that these limitations can be overcome by exploiting readily available or easily determined positional information instead of complete CSI.\n\nUsing this positional information, we develop an approximate channel model and derive a low-complexity, distributed linear precoder and equalizer based on beamspace MIMO [13], [14]. The precoder requires only knowledge of each satellite's own rotation and the position of itself and the GS, achieving near-optimal spectral efficiency.  Similarly, the equalizer relies solely on angle of arrival (AoA) information for the satellites, demonstrating near-optimal performance with proper swarm design.  We analytically determine the optimal swarm layout and numerically evaluate the overall system performance.\n\nExisting research on multi-satellite communication includes studies on downlink transmission from a large nano-satellite swarm to a single antenna GS, demonstrating significant array gain through in-phase signal combination at the GS [10].  Work in [15] explores communication between multiple satellites and a multi-antenna GS, using iterative interference cancellation to address spatial correlation between GEO satellites.  The capacity of multi-satellite systems is investigated in [16] and [17].  A distributed precoding algorithm based on the MMSE criterion and inter-satellite information exchange is proposed for multi-user downlink scenarios in [18].  Zero-forcing equalization at the ground terminal for reception from two satellites is explored in [11]. Finally, beamspace MIMO has been adapted to ground-to-satellite communication, primarily focusing on single satellite scenarios [19]-[21].",
        "The study of limit cycles in nonlinear differential systems, particularly their bifurcation from equilibria, has been a long-standing challenge since Poincar\u00e9's introduction of the concept in the late 19th century [45].  A key problem, known as the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem [23], focuses on determining the number and position of limit cycles for planar polynomial systems, a question that remains open.  This challenge has spurred extensive research, including significant contributions to the qualitative theory of differential equations by figures like Lyapunov [41], Bendixson [6], Andronov [1], and Arnold [2].\n\nHistorically, determining the number of limit cycles has yielded surprising results.  For example, Petrovsky and Landis [43] attempted to prove a maximum of 3 limit cycles for planar quadratic systems, only to be contradicted by Chen and Wang [12] and Shi [51] who independently discovered examples with 4.  Such unexpected findings fueled further interest in quadratic and cubic systems, leading to results like Li et al.'s proof [32] of at least 13 limit cycles in planar cubic systems, the current best known lower bound. These and other results have not only enriched the qualitative theory of differential equations but also found important applications in science and engineering.\n\nThis paper focuses on complete zero-Hopf bifurcations, where limit cycles emerge from zero-Hopf equilibria in higher-dimensional systems.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nTraffic accidents result in numerous injuries and fatalities each year [1]. To address this issue, automotive companies continuously develop advanced active and passive safety measures to protect both passengers and other road users. The emergence of connected vehicle infrastructure and Vehicle to Everything (V2X) connectivity through on-board units presents new opportunities for accident prevention. V2X-equipped vehicles maintain awareness of their surroundings through Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) communication systems. Furthermore, Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication provides critical information about traffic signal status and intersection geometry.\n\nThis comprehensive data enables both autonomous and manually driven vehicles to navigate more effectively and optimize speed for improved fuel efficiency. Among V2X methods, V2I communication offers distinct advantages in implementation and broader benefits, as it doesn't require all vehicles to have on-board communication equipment. Installing a Roadside Unit (RSU) at an intersection can benefit any vehicle equipped with an On-Board Unit (OBU). Additionally, when combined with camera or Lidar-based recognition systems, the RSU can broadcast information about approaching vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists, enabling limited V2V functionality even for vehicles without OBU equipment [2].\n\nV2I communication offers multiple benefits, including:\n- Optimization of traffic light timing [3, 4]\n- Reduction of traffic congestion\n- Enhanced travel efficiency for all road users\n- Improved localization through map matching [5]\n- Detection of traffic violations, such as speed limit infractions [6] and red light violations\n\nThis paper presents two V2I application algorithms that utilize signal phase and timing information:\n1.

        "To improve the logical flow and coherence of the text, it can be restructured as follows:\n\n---\n\nWith recent advances in epigenetics, more than 170 distinct modifications have been identified on RNA. Among them, 5-formylcytidine (f5C) has emerged as an abundant regulated modification. f5C was first discovered in the mitochondrial tRNA Met of bovine and nematode in 1994 and was also found in squids, frogs, chickens, rats, and fruit flies in recent decades.\n\nDuring the setting process of f5C on the transcriptome, C34 (position 34 of the mammalian mitochondrial methionine transfer RNA) is methylated to form 5-methylcytosine (m5C) under the catalysis of NSUN RNA methyltransferase. Subsequently, m5C is oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hm5C) and then to f5C. Although the functions of f5C are still largely unknown, it strongly indicates that loss of f5C will result in pathological consequences. Research has shown that f5C in mitochondrial tRNA Met plays a crucial role in recognizing and decoding the nonuniversal AUA codon as Met. Moreover, two pathogenic point mutations in mitochondrial tRNA Met were found to prevent NSUN3-mediated methylation, leading to reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis and oxygen consumption, thus causing defective mitochondrial activity. In addition, f5C is essential for mice's embryonic development and respiratory complexes.\n\nTo accurately identify f5C, researchers have developed several biological experimental approaches. One method, based on Friedlander synthesis, involves a bisulfite-free and single-base-resolution approach, although it has limitations in converting m5C to f5C. To address this, Liu et al. presented an alternative method named TET-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (TAPS), which showed better performance in whole-genome sequencing of mouse embryonic stem cells. Inspired by their approach, Wang et al. developed a mutation-assisted profiling method in 2022, named f5C-seq, which provides a single-base resolution map of f5C on the transcriptome.\n\nDespite these experimental advances, the verification of all the f5C candidates through experiments can be time-consuming and costly. With the development of machine learning, computational methods have become increasingly popular as useful alternative methods. Several computational methods have been developed for RNA or DNA modification recognition, such as models for N6-methyladenosine (6mA) modification and N7-Methylguanosine (m7G) and m5C prediction. However, a recognition model for the f5C modification has not been reported yet, presenting a strong motivation to establish one.\n\nDeep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP), leading to the emergence of numerous language models. Inspired by the success of these models, researchers have proposed biological language models, which have shown promising results in bio-sequence prediction tasks. Given the similarities between sentences and bio-sequences, these models hold the potential for predicting modifications in DNA or RNA.\n\nBiological language models, such as PlncRNA-HDeep, EMDLP, and BERT-m7G, employ advanced techniques like LSTM, CNN, and BERT for RNA modification prediction. While these models have achieved significant progress in predictive performance, they often lack interpretability, hindering the identification of important sequence-based influences in RNA methylation prediction. Furthermore, there is a lack of efficient identification models for f5C modification and interpretable methods to characterize its features.\n\nMotivated by these challenges, this study proposes f5C-finder, an explainable ensemble biological language model for f5C identification. The workflow involves obtaining RNA sequences with f5C modification, formatting datasets with equal positive and negative samples, and utilizing five feature schemes for feature extraction.",
        "**Introduction to Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Technology**\n\nIn the near future, transportation systems are expected to be comprised of vehicles with varying levels of connectivity and autonomy. Connected Vehicle (CV) technology enables communication among vehicles, infrastructure, and other road users (Monteil et al., 2013). This technology enhances the ability of vehicles to perceive beyond the driver's line of sight and allows transportation infrastructure to proactively respond to stochastic changes in road conditions and travel demand.\n\nAutonomous Vehicle Technology automates vehicles at different levels. Level 0 indicates no automation, while levels 1 and 2 involve single and multiple driving assistant systems, respectively. Level 3 automation allows for the transfer of control authority between the human driver and the autonomous entity when automation fails. At Level 4, vehicles can control all functionalities within specified regions. Finally, Level 5 autonomy allows vehicles to travel anywhere without human intervention (Committee et al., 2014). \n\n**Synergy of Connected and Automated Vehicle Technologies**\n\nThough connected and automated vehicle technologies can be deployed independently, their combination offers a synergistic effect that surpasses individual benefits. When implemented, Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technology has the potential to significantly improve mobility, enhance traffic flow stability, reduce congestion, and improve fuel economy. The degree of benefit realization in real-world conditions depends on various factors, with trajectory planning of CAVs being critical (Gasparetto et al., 2015). Trajectory planning ensures collision-free paths for vehicles while considering dynamics, surrounding traffic, and rules (Zhang et al., 2013). More advanced techniques may incorporate objectives like fuel economy (Zeng and Wang, 2018; Han, 2014; Yu et al., 2016; Lee, 2011).\n\n**Trajectory Planning and Lane Changing**\n\nTrajectory planning traditionally relies on vehicle dynamics constraints, such as acceleration and steering performance. Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) like adaptive cruise control (ACC) enhance planning using on-board sensor data. CV technology expands data types (e.g., weather conditions) from a broader spatial range, requiring the development of algorithmic tools to incorporate this into planning. Connected Cruise Control (CCC) and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) attempt to use vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in planning.",
        "The European Union's Emission Trading System (EU-ETS) is the world's first major carbon trading market aimed at combatting climate change and reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions cost-effectively. It operates on a Cap-and-Trade (CAP) principle, allowing companies with point source emissions to receive or purchase emission allowances that can be traded as needed. This complex centralized trading system involves making centralized decisions on aggregate emission quantities, writing allowances accordingly, and distributing them among emission sources.\n\nSince 2018, the EU-ETS has started penalizing vehicle manufacturers for surpassing fleet-wide emission targets for new vehicles sold annually. Manufacturers must pay an excess emissions premium for each gram per km above the set target. The focus is on implementing a new trusted and distributed system to audit emissions at the vehicle-level.\n\nDistributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have introduced peer-to-peer applications that ensure trust among parties involved. Blockchain technology is a type of DLT where every node maintains a copy of the ledger, enabling secure and immutable transactions with consensus among network nodes. The primary goal of applying Blockchain to the transportation industry is to establish a fully distributed ETS system facilitating direct communication between producers and consumers while bypassing administrative issues and ensuring security.\n\nIn this study, a distributed emissions allowance trading system called B-ETS is proposed to address the challenges of the current EU-ETS system. This system utilizes Blockchain and Smart Contracts to allow emission exchanges among vehicles transparently and immutably. An economic incentive-based mechanism encourages drivers to reduce emissions by penalizing excessive emissions and rewarding good driving behavior.\n\nThe proposed V2V-based allowance trading system complements the existing EU-ETS by holding drivers accountable for meeting personal emissions targets. This personalized feedback and incentives motivate drivers to contribute to environmental sustainability by maintaining a positive Emission Allowance Balance (EAB) and avoiding penalties for excessive emissions.\n\nThe study's contributions include introducing B-ETS as a distributed Blockchain-based emission trading system compliant with EU-ETS regulations, implementing an economic incentive-based system to promote eco-friendly driving habits, and presenting a theoretical model to evaluate the communication efficiency of the proposed system. The paper is structured to delve into the system model and analysis, performance evaluation, and concluding remarks, highlighting future research directions.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, enhancing clarity and flow while maintaining the academic tone and technical accuracy:\n\nMachine Learning (ML) is the study of self-improving algorithms that learn models directly from data [94]. These algorithms iteratively update their parameters based on input data, developing models that represent underlying patterns. A crucial measure of an ML model's success is its ability to generalize\u2014to accurately process previously unseen data. This capacity for generalization is often considered a hallmark of \"intelligence\" [131], as it enables models to leverage historical data for future predictions.\n\nThe past decade has witnessed remarkable advances in ML, driven primarily by increased data availability and computational power [4]. As ML models increasingly influence decision-making processes [22], four key requirements have emerged: fairness, accountability, confidentiality, and transparency [99]. However, the inherent complexity of ML models\u2014often involving intricate architectures and numerous parameters\u2014can make them difficult to interpret, leading to their characterization as \"black boxes\" [20]. This thesis focuses specifically on enhancing transparency through mechanisms that provide insight into ML models, typically through explanations.\n\nThe emergence of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) represents a significant development in AI research, aiming to demystify complex ML model predictions [47]. Explanations serve to make ML models more accountable by illuminating both their decision-making processes and potential avenues for modification or contestation [141]. We categorize explanations into two primary types:\n\n1. Behavior-based explanations: These illuminate the algorithmic and mathematical foundations of ML model predictions, including:\n   - Feature importance rankings [86, 107]\n   - Influential training sample identification [69, 116]\n   - Prototypical example selection [73, 129]\n   - Counterfactual perturbation generation [122, 139, 141]\n\n2. Process-based explanations: These detail the ML pipeline itself, encompassing:\n   - Data collection and preprocessing methodologies [39]\n   - Model training and evaluation procedures [91]\n\nThis thesis comprises three sections focusing on algorithms, users, and pedagogy, respectively. The first two sections develop behavior-based explanation methods, building on Guidotti et al.'s [47] taxonomy, which we've adapted to include:\n\n**Problem Types:**\n- Global explanations (general model behavior)\n- Local explanations (individual predictions)\n- Inspection (visual representations)\n- Transparent design (inherent interpretability)\n\n**Model Approaches:**\n- Model-specific (requiring full access)\n- Model-agnostic (black-box treatment)\n\n**Explanation Mechanisms:**\n- Decision rules\n- Feature attributions\n- Sensitivity analysis\n- Prototype selection\n\n**Data Types:**\n- Tabular\n- Image\n- Text\n- Graph\n\nChapters 2 and 3 focus on local, model-specific explanation methods. This approach reflects both the foundational nature of local explanations in developing global understanding [137] and the practical advantage of having full model access in many real-world scenarios. Chapter 2 presents an algorithm specific to tree ensembles and tabular data, while Chapter 3 addresses graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph data.",
        "While the world has been comprehensively mapped in 2D for decades, the vertical dimension remains underexplored despite its vast potential. This gap is particularly critical in the Global South due to inherent mapping inequalities and diverse data availability.  Accurately representing human settlements in 3D requires describing the vertical dimension in addition to 2D footprints and shapes [19, 11, 14, 7, 23]. Such 3D representations are crucial for various applications, including quiet and shadow routing [35], environmental exposure modeling [2, 40, 34], architecture and city planning [32, 36], and population capacity estimation [37, 21].  However, deriving low-cost, open-source 3D building representations at scale remains a challenge.  Here, \"low-cost\" primarily refers to the cost of data acquisition for 3D building modeling.\n\nTraditional methods like photogrammetry and remote sensing make 3D city reconstruction expensive and time-consuming, often requiring extensive expertise and substantial geospatial data (e.g., cadastral data, airborne photogrammetry data). This poses a significant barrier for stakeholders and city governments with limited funding seeking to establish 3D city modeling systems.  Fortunately, the growing availability of Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI) and crowdsourcing technology [16] offers a scalable, low-cost solution for 3D world mapping.  OpenStreetMap (OSM), the most successful VGI project, has emerged as a valuable global data source for creating large-scale 3D city models [14, 12].  For example, a method for generating large-scale 3D urban reconstructions by jointly processing OSM and multi-sensor remote sensing data (e.g., TanDEM-X and Sentinel-2) was developed in [10].  Milojevic-Dupont et al. [27] demonstrated the potential of accurately predicting building heights using only morphometric features (urban forms) extracted from OSM data (e.g., building and street geometry).",
        "To improve the logical flow and coherence of the text, it can be structured as follows:\n\nA geometric edge-to-edge tiling is a covering of the two-dimensional plane by polygonal tiles, such that there is no hole, no two tiles overlap, and adjacent tiles share a full edge. When all tiles are rhombuses (having four sides of equal lengths), it is called an edge-to-edge rhombus tiling. \n\nIn the 1980s, de Bruijn discovered a duality between a class of edge-to-edge rhombus tilings and regular multigrids [dB81, dB86]. The former can be obtained from a finite family of infinitely many evenly spaced parallel lines (along a finite set of directions called normal vectors; each group of parallel lines also has a reference position called offset) by a correspondence associating a tile to each intersection of two lines. To leverage the results of [AI16], we first consider corona limits on the multigrid, to take advantage of its embodiment of the tiling's regularities. During a second step, we transfer our characterization of corona limits on the multigrid to the dual edge-to-edge rhombus tilings.\n\nThe most famous examples of edge-to-edge rhombus tilings are certainly Penrose tilings [Pen74]. They received great attention for their aesthetics and combinatorial properties in connection with the growth of quasicrystals [BG17]. They have the property of being aperiodic (no translation vector leaves the tiling unchanged) and quasiperiodic (every finite subset of tiles appears infinitely often).\n\nIt has been proven in [AI16] that, surprisingly, regular decagons emerge as fundamental elements of the structure of Penrose tilings. From an initial finite set of selected tiles called a patch, the edge-to-edge diffusion process (at each discrete step, tiles adjacent to the current selected patch are included in the selection) produces a regular decagon at the limit (after renormalization). This limit shape is called the corona limit. The authors of [AI16] studied the corona limits of Penrose tilings through the pattern of signal propagation in simple growth cellular automata, using combinatorial tools related to local dynamical behaviors specific to Penrose tilings (Ammann bars).\n\nRegular corona limits obviously appear on simple periodic tilings such as triangular, square, and hexagonal grids and have also been characterized on other periodic tilings [ACIK19]. The corona limits of multigrid dual tilings are also discussed in [DHS22], where the authors state a similar result without a full formal proof.\n\nLimit shapes of growth processes on R^d (and Z^d) have been studied in [GG93] for threshold dynamics (\u03b8 > 0) defined over a given finite neighborhood (N \u2282 R^d). It has been proven that, except in degenerated cases, there is a unique limit shape which is a polygon. Growth processes on groups also received attention. In [EM23], the authors consider strongly connected groups \u0393 and the iterated Minkowski sum \u03c6^n A (W) = {w a | w \u2208 W, a \u2208 A}. When A contains the neutral element and generates \u0393, it has been proven that \u03c6^n A ({v}) tends to \u0393 (as n tends to \u221e).",
        "One of the most renowned and enduring problems in computer science is the question of whether P equals NP. Solving this problem would have profound implications across various fields, from economics to cybersecurity. Over the years, many have claimed to have proven whether P equals NP or P does not equal NP. However, to date, none of these claims have been validated. \n\nThere are multiple approaches to attempting such a proof. One approach involves using lower bounds on the complexity of circuits. By demonstrating that a known NP-complete problem has a circuit complexity that is exponentially lower-bounded, one could prove that P does not equal NP. In the paper \"A Solution of the P versus NP Problem Based on a Specific Property of the Clique Function\" [Sim19], Sima endeavors to do precisely this. Sima examines the clique function, aiming to show that its circuit complexity is exponential, thereby proving that P does not equal NP. \n\nIn this paper, we will first introduce the relevant definitions and the prior work that Sima builds upon. We will then present Sima's argument, highlighting the points where it fails, due to the improper generalization and the oversight of the relationship between a Boolean variable and its negation. Finally, we will provide an example that illustrates the flaw in the algorithm.",
        "Equids are prey animals by nature, showing as few signs of pain as possible to avoid predators. In domesticated horses, the instinct to hide pain is still present, and the presence of humans may disrupt ongoing pain behavior. Recognizing pain is inherently subjective and time-consuming, and is challenging for both horse owners and equine veterinarian experts. An accurate automatic pain detection method has the potential to increase animal welfare.\n\nOrthopedic disorders are frequent in horses and are one of the most common causes for euthanasia, although treatable if detected early. The pain displayed by the horse may be subtle and infrequent, which can leave the injury undetected.\n\nPain is a complex multidimensional experience with sensory and affective components. The affective component is associated with changes in behavior to avoid pain or protect the painful area. Some pain behaviors, such as lameness in orthopedic disorders and rolling in abdominal disorders, may be directly related to the location of the painful area. Acute pain in horses has a sudden onset and specific causes like inflammation, trauma, or ischemia.\n\nRecognizing horse pain automatically from video requires a method for fine-grained action recognition that can detect subtle behavioral signals over time. The labels in this scenario are inherently noisy since the horse's subjective experience of pain cannot be directly observed. To complicate matters further, the behavioral patterns indicative of pain may also appear in non-pain data.\n\nExpert pain assessment in horses involves evaluating predetermined body behaviors and facial expressions displayed by the horse during a short observation period. Equine pain research focuses on identifying combinations of behaviors and facial expressions for general pain and specific types of pain, such as orthopedic pain. Behavioral patterns and facial expressions are part of the non-verbal communication system of healthy horses as well.\n\nThis article explores machine learning recognition of equine orthopedic pain characterized by sparse visual expressions. The study uses domain transfer from acute pain recognition to detect sporadic signs of pain behavior in low-grade orthopedic pain data. The article presents empirical results using real-world datasets and compares performance to a human baseline.\n\nThe contributions of this work include investigating domain transfer between different types of pain in animals, presenting empirical results using real-world datasets, and analyzing the challenges of deep learning for video outside controlled benchmarking datasets. The study also compares domain transfer from a horse pain dataset to standard video features from a general action recognition dataset and conducts an explainability study of orthopedic pain detection in video clips.\n\nThe article is structured with related work in Section 2, followed by methodology and dataset descriptions in Section 3. The experiments and discussion are presented in Section 4, and conclusions with future directions are outlined in Section 6.",
        "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made significant progress in various computer vision applications. However, as research advances, the depth of networks has increased from a few layers to hundreds of layers. The vast number of parameters and ultra-high computational complexity of CNNs pose constraints on their deployment, especially in applications with high real-time requirements or limited storage capacity. To address this issue, various compression techniques for CNNs have emerged.\n\nNetwork pruning reduces model redundancy by pruning convolutional kernels or channels, efficient architecture design replaces conventional convolutional layers with well-designed lightweight modules to expedite network inference, knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from complex networks (teachers) to compact networks (students), and quantization replaces 32-bit weights and activations with low-bit (e.g., 16-bit) ones to reduce both memory footprint and computational complexity. The extreme form of quantization is binarization. Compared to 32-bit floating-point networks, network binarization constrains both weights and activations to {-1, +1}, requiring only a 1-bit representation for the parameters of binary neural networks (BNNs). This significantly reduces the storage requirement and inference delay, making network binarization a promising technique for compression.\n\nDespite the advantages of network binarization in compression and acceleration, existing methods still face a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. For instance, XNOR-Net and Bi-Real Net have improved BNN accuracy with minimal extra computation, but there remains a notable accuracy gap compared to full-precision networks. Conversely, Group-Net and MeliusNet achieve comparable accuracy but introduce additional computational costs, offsetting the benefits of binarization. Therefore, this work aims to strike a better balance between accuracy and computational complexity for BNNs.\n\nThe performance degradation of BNNs is primarily due to their limited representational capability, representing weights and activations with only 1-bit precision compared to full-precision counterparts. This limitation results in restricted data information acceptance and significant information loss during forward propagation. To address these issues, IR 2 Net is proposed as a binarization approach to enhance BNNs by restricting input information and recovering feature information.\n\nIR 2 Net employs an information restriction method to regulate input information and optimize network representational capability without introducing additional costs. Additionally, an information recovery method is used to counter information loss during forward propagation by merging shallow and deep information to enhance accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the contributions of IR 2 Net include mitigating information loss and the mismatch between learning ability and information quantity caused by the limited representational capability of BNNs, introducing an information restriction method to match input information with network learning ability, proposing an information recovery method to combat information loss during forward propagation, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.",
        "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm enabling collaborative model training across numerous devices without direct data sharing, driven by the increasing prevalence of machine learning in the Internet of Things (McMahan et al. 2017; Imteaj et al. 2022).  Traditional FL employs a parameter-server (PS) architecture where a central server aggregates models and broadcasts updates (Kairouz et al. 2019). However, this centralized approach suffers from communication bottlenecks and potential server vulnerabilities (Lian et al. 2017).\n\nDecentralized learning offers a promising alternative, utilizing peer-to-peer communication for faster convergence (Lian et al. 2017, 2018).  In this framework, each worker maintains a local model copy and collaborates with neighbors to achieve a consensus model.  However, data heterogeneity, a common challenge in both centralized and decentralized learning, can hinder performance. When data distributions vary significantly across workers, a single shared model may perform poorly on individual devices. Consequently, personalized decentralized learning, where each worker learns a tailored model (Vanhaesebrouck, Bellet, and Tommasi 2017; Dai et al. 2022), becomes crucial.\n\nThis paper advances personalized decentralized learning by leveraging the concept of shared representations.  Inspired by observations in centralized learning (Bengio, Courville, and Vincent 2013; LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015), we exploit the idea that heterogeneous data, even with different labels, can share a common low-dimensional representation.  Following the pioneering work of Collins et al. (2021) in the centralized setting, we extend this principle to decentralized learning.  We propose that each worker's model comprises a shared global representation map (\u03d5: R<sup>d</sup> \u2192 R<sup>z</sup>) and a personalized local head (\u03b8<sub>i</sub>: R<sup>z</sup> \u2192 Y), where z \u226a d.  This structure simplifies local optimization of the worker-specific heads. While Collins et al. (2021) analyzed linear global representations, we address the open questions of developing a fully decentralized algorithm for the general non-linear case and providing its convergence analysis.\n\nSpecifically, we introduce DePRL, a decentralized algorithm that alternates updates between global representation and local head parameters to solve the optimization problem min<sub>\u03d5\u2208\u03a6</sub> (1/N) \u03a3<sup>N</sup><sub>i=1</sub> min<sub>\u03b8i\u2208\u0398</sub> F<sub>i</sub>(\u03b8<sub>i</sub> \u2022 \u03d5), where F<sub>i</sub>(\u2022) represents worker i's loss function.  In each round, workers update their local head and global representation using stochastic gradient descent, share updated global representations with neighbors, and compute a weighted average to achieve consensus.\n\nUnlike conventional decentralized learning with a single shared model (Lian et al. 2017, 2018; Assran et al. 2019), DePRL involves coupled updates of local head and global representation parameters, requiring novel proof techniques for convergence analysis.  Our contributions are threefold:\n\n* **DePRL Algorithm:** We introduce DePRL, the first fully decentralized algorithm that learns a shared global representation and personalized local heads for improved performance in heterogeneous data environments.\n\n* **Convergence Rate:** We establish a new notion of \u03f5-approximation solution and provide the first convergence analysis for personalized decentralized learning with shared non-linear representations. We demonstrate a convergence rate of O(1/\u221aNK), where N is the number of workers and K is a sufficiently large number of communication rounds, indicating a linear speedup with respect to the number of workers. This result, highly desirable for large-scale decentralized systems, also guarantees consensus on the shared global representation while maintaining personalized local heads, offering insights into generalization to unseen workers.\n\n* **Evaluation:**  We empirically validate DePRL's performance and theoretical findings through experiments on various datasets with representative DNN models, demonstrating superior performance in heterogeneous settings compared to existing baselines.",
        "Modeling long-range sequences is fundamental to solving many real-world challenges. Applications range from processing biosignals like electroencephalograms spanning tens of thousands of time steps [Tang et al., 2023] to comprehending and generating large documents (e.g., novels, scientific papers) using large language models [Zhou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023].\n\nDeep learning methods are state-of-the-art for numerous challenging tasks, including learning functions over variable-length input sequences. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) emerged early as strong contenders. They compress sequences by incorporating input elements sequentially, using only O(1) operations per input token and sharing parameters across time steps (Figure 1a). Notably, RNNs are partially inspired by cognitive and neurological computational principles [Lipton et al., 2015].  Perhaps unsurprisingly, they also underpin another class of biologically grounded architectures: spiking neural networks (SNNs) (Figure 1b). SNNs process sequences using simplified mathematical models of biological neurons that relay computations using sparse binary spikes [Maass, 1997]. The goal is to emulate the brain's efficient neural coding, enabling computation with a fraction of the energy required by modern von Neumann machines [Hasler, 2017].\n\nRNNs are affected by vanishing and exploding gradients [Pascanu et al., 2013], stemming from unstable recurrent weight initialization and backpropagation through time (BPTT) (Figure 1a). These phenomena hinder learning long-range dependencies, and while gating mechanisms like long short-term memory (LSTM) [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] can mitigate them, they are difficult to eliminate entirely.  Furthermore, traditional RNNs apply nonlinearities at each time step (\u03c3 in Figure 1a), requiring iterative computations. This is acceptable during inference, where input sequence elements arrive sequentially. However, RNN forward passes become prohibitively slow during training with long sequences because they cannot leverage GPU parallelization due to the nonlinear state propagation [Yarga and Wood, 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023; Kalchbrenner et al., 2016].\n\nAdditional challenges arise in SNN learning because binary spiking is non-differentiable, precluding direct training with backpropagation. One solution is training an artificial neural network (ANN) and converting its continuous activations to spikes [Diehl et al., 2015]. However, this introduces inference latency and often leads to excessive firing, impacting energy efficiency [Davidson and Furber, 2021]. Another solution is training SNNs directly using surrogate gradients [Neftci et al., 2019]. Nevertheless, even with surrogate-based training, SNNs are generally outperformed by ANNs like LSTMs [Malcom and Casco-Rodriguez, 2023].\n\nThe Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] overcomes these RNN limitations by directly compressing the context for each token, measuring its relationship to all other elements (Figure 1c).  Besides improving performance, its core component, self-attention, is easily parallelized through GPU-friendly matrix multiplication, accelerating training [Zeyer et al., 2019]. Consequently, Transformer blocks have been crucial to the current era of large pre-trained models [Min et al., 2023].\n\nHowever, the parallel, dense matrix multiplications that have established the Transformer as the de facto standard also accentuate structural differences between SNNs and ANNs. SNNs are designed for neuromorphic platforms like Intel Loihi [Davies et al., 2021], potentially enabling orders of magnitude lower energy consumption. These efficiencies are partly achieved by representing information as sparse, address-identified events. Spike events then \"excite\" targeted synapses asynchronously, with accumulation occurring within postsynaptic neurons. This enables addition-based feature mixing, reducing costly Multiply-and-Accumulate (MAC) operations [Li et al., 2023].  Massive parallel matrix multiplications, as required by self-attention, contrast with this event-driven, brain-inspired computing philosophy. Therefore, lessons from Transformer research have seen limited adoption in SNNs [Zhou et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023].",
        "The 28-day compressive strength is a widely accepted metric for characterizing concrete performance in engineering applications.  While this standardized index primarily evaluates the ultimate strength of concrete mixtures [1], it also serves as a convenient measure for inferring other critical mechanical properties like elastic modulus, stiffness, and tensile strength [2]. Accurate strength predictions are crucial for efficient and high-quality construction. Insufficient strength can lead to catastrophic infrastructure failures, while overdesigned strength results in higher material costs [3] and increased environmental burdens like CO2 emissions from cement production [4].\n\nOver the past decades, considerable effort has been devoted to developing predictive models correlating concrete mixture proportions with strength performance [5].  An ideal model not only predicts strength but also provides insights for designing concrete with improved constructability, durability, and/or lower cost [6, 7]. Conventional approaches often rely on physics or chemistry-based relationships [8, 9, 10]. While the influence of major proportioning parameters like water-to-cementitious ratio (w/cm), aggregate fraction, and air void content has been extensively studied, other factors like chemical and mineral admixtures or aggregate gradation also play a role [11].  However, the complexity of these property-strength correlations makes developing a robust and universal concrete strength model using conventional approaches challenging [12].\n\nMachine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for strength prediction.  ML-based predictions have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional approaches, particularly for non-linear problems [13].  Without relying on physical or chemical assumptions, ML can extract hidden, non-intuitive feature patterns directly from data, making it a promising approach for predicting concrete strength [14, 15, 16, 17].\n\nHowever, ML algorithms typically require large datasets to effectively learn the input-output relationships [18, 19]. This poses a challenge for concrete strength applications due to limited access to industrial concrete strength data, which is often incomplete, lacking information on factors like curing temperature, additives, and aggregate types.  Accurate and consistent data is essential for ML, but concrete strength data can be inconsistent due to non-standardized measurements and data recording practices [20]. For instance, concrete strength can vary significantly depending on the testing protocol or specimen size [21, 22, 23].  While large datasets can mitigate these issues, their impact is magnified with smaller datasets.  Therefore, it's crucial to assess how the reliability of ML-based concrete strength prediction depends on the amount of training data.\n\nThis study addresses two core questions: (i) how much data is sufficient for training an ML model, and (ii) which ML algorithms are best suited for small datasets. Building on our previous work [17, 24], we explore these questions using three archetypal learning algorithms: polynomial regression (PR), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF).",
        "Person Re-identification (ReID), the retrieval of the same person across multiple cameras, has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry [19, 30, 33, 35, 42, 43]. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have greatly improved ReID accuracy, their black-box nature limits trust, especially in critical applications [44].  This paper addresses the crucial yet under-explored area of interpreting CNN-based person ReID models.\n\nA typical CNN-based ReID system maps query and gallery images into a metric space, calculating pairwise distances to generate a ranked list of gallery images, as illustrated in Figure 1(a).  While existing methods like Ranking Activation Maps [37] can visualize related regions between individuals, they lack semantic explanations of similarity or dissimilarity.  Attributes, such as clothing color and type, offer human-understandable semantics and have been used as mid-level ReID features [18].  However, no existing method leverages attributes to explain ReID results.  This paper aims to develop an attribute-guided interpreter to answer two key questions: 1) which attributes differentiate two individuals, and 2) how much each attribute contributes to this difference, as visualized in Figure 1(b).  Such an interpreter can help users focus on key discrepancies and aid developers in improving ReID accuracy, as shown in Figure 1(c).\n\nInterpreting ReID models with attributes presents unique challenges.  The distance-based output of ReID models complicates the use of class activation or gradients for visualization and semantic disentanglement, unlike classification tasks [24, 47].  The diverse and imbalanced nature of real-world attributes [7, 15, 18] can introduce biases, with prominent attributes like coats potentially overshadowing smaller yet discriminative attributes like hats.  Furthermore, the availability of only weakly-annotated image-level or ID-level attribute labels, without precise bounding boxes or masks [18], hinders accurate attribute localization and visualization.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose Attribute-guided Metric Distillation, a post-hoc method for explainable person ReID.  We introduce a pluggable interpreter network that leverages knowledge from a target ReID model via metric distillation.  This interpreter, grafted onto the target model, inherits the initial CNN stages to utilize low-level and mid-level features.  The remaining layers incorporate an attribute decomposition head, enabling the generation of attribute-guided attention maps (AAMs) for input image pairs.  These AAMs visualize discriminative attributes and decompose visual features and distances into attribute-guided components, quantifying each attribute's contribution to the overall distance.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its technical accuracy while improving readability and flow:\n\nThe Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) serves as the secure element in mobile devices, containing essential identifiers and cryptographic credentials that authenticate mobile subscribers to their network operators (MNOs). Traditionally implemented as a removable smart card, the SIM has allowed users to switch between different mobile subscribers and networks simply by changing cards. Modern devices, however, are increasingly adopting the embedded SIM (eSIM)\u2014a secure element integrated directly into the device's circuit board that can be programmed with multiple SIM profiles.\n\nRemote SIM Provisioning (RSP) [32], as specified by the GSM Association (GSMA), enables the downloading and installation of SIM profiles into this secure element. This protocol reduces logistical and production costs while offering subscribers the flexibility to change operators online [56]. RSP comes in two variants: the machine-to-machine (M2M) version [33, 34] for remotely controllable devices, and the consumer version [35, 36] for smartphones, tablets, and wearables. The key distinction between these variants lies in user interaction requirements\u2014M2M operates autonomously, while the consumer version requires user initiation for profile management operations.\n\nEach SIM profile contains critical security information, including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and subscriber key \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc56, which the user equipment (UE) shares with the MNO. These credentials are essential for the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure that grants network access [2], making secure profile delivery paramount.\n\nSecurity breaches involving SIM profiles can lead to severe consequences, including identity theft, billing fraud, eavesdropping, and privacy violations. Past incidents highlight these risks: attackers have successfully captured profile credentials by infiltrating SIM manufacturer networks [51] and executed memory-exhaustion attacks against secure elements through M2M RSP protocol vulnerabilities [45].\n\nThis paper presents a comprehensive security analysis of the consumer RSP protocol, employing formal protocol modeling and requirements verification through applied pi calculus and the ProVerif tool [16]. Our key contributions include:\n\n1. Development of the first formal model of the consumer RSP protocol, based on core message flows and content from the specification [35, 36].\n\n2. Identification and formalization of explicit and implicit security requirements, including analysis under partial compromise scenarios.\n\n3. Detailed verification results revealing unexpected security vulnerabilities under partial compromise conditions, with clear explanations of attack vectors and root causes.\n\n4. Practical recommendations for specification enhancement and implementation guidance, verified through formal modeling.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers foundational concepts in protocol modeling, ProVerif, and SIM provisioning security.",

Computer science proficiency stands out as a key competency applicable across various disciplines, careers, and civic contexts. With the \"Computer Science For All\" initiative, computer science courses are increasingly being implemented in K-12 education. Simultaneously, efforts at different levels are aimed at enhancing environmental science education to address climate challenges. California, for instance, is committed to fostering environmental literacy throughout K-12 education, following the lead of the California Department of Education, while the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development focuses on instilling behaviors necessary for sustainability.\n\nIntegrating computer science and environmental science into the curriculum enriches students' skills in both areas. This integration not only enhances learning experiences but also cultivates computing and computational thinking abilities. By using coding as a tool, students can create projects to address societal issues and teach scientific concepts. Through coding, students not only learn how to code but also utilize it to achieve their creative goals, nurturing computational thinking skills in the process.\n\nData literacy is another crucial skill across academic disciplines and everyday life, playing a vital role in various domains. Data literacy empowers students to make informed decisions, enhances problem-solving abilities, and prepares them for active civic engagement. Initiating data literacy education early on is crucial in equipping students with these essential skills.\n\nAn integrated computer science curriculum, utilizing culturally sustaining pedagogy, can benefit underrepresented students by creating a multisensory learning environment.

        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nWhile pre-training resources for Hebrew language models continue to expand, primarily through multi-lingual datasets, resources for downstream tasks remain limited. Although some attention has been given to tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering (Amram et al., 2018; Bareket and Tsarfaty, 2021; Cohen et al., 2023), other tasks such as summarization remain largely unexplored.\n\nConclusion extraction, a close relative of summarization, differs in its fundamental approach. Where summarization seeks to extract or generate spans that best capture the context, conclusion extraction aims to distill a higher level of logical knowledge by combining context with the author's prior knowledge.\n\nUnlike most extractive summarization datasets, such as CNN/Daily Mail (Nallapati et al., 2016), where effective summaries can often be derived from the first and last paragraphs, general-purpose extractive summarization more closely resembles the WikiHow dataset (Koupaee and Wang, 2018), where relevant content is distributed throughout the text.\n\nBuilding upon the work of Shalumov and Haskey (2023), we aimed to expand Hebrew NLP resources for both standard-length and long documents, with particular attention to underserved tasks. We focused on the State Comptroller and Ombudsman of Israel reports, which provide comprehensive periodic state audits covering various public sector entities, including government ministries, state institutions, local authorities, statutory corporations, and government companies.\n\nOur analysis of these reports yielded two primary datasets:\n1. MevakerSumm: An abstractive summarization dataset containing audit contexts and their corresponding summaries\n2. MevakerConc: An extractive conclusions dataset containing audit contexts, conclusion offsets marked by auditors, and the conclusion text within these offsets\n\nBeyond dataset creation, we sought to develop models for understudied tasks, specifically Conclusion Extraction and Conclusion Allocation. To support model training, we developed two auxiliary datasets from MevakerConc:\n- MevakerConcSen: Contains sentences with binary labels indicating conclusion status and their source topics\n- MevakerConcTree: Structured for conclusion allocation training\n\nFor conclusion extraction, we explored various classification approaches, ranging from simple sentence classification to more complex seq2seq classification of sentence embeddings (Lukasik et al., 2020). We developed multiple models (HeConE, HeConEspc) with varying architectural complexity.\n\nFor conclusion allocation, after experimenting with several approaches, we implemented a cross-encoder similarity model (HeCross) that treats unlabeled conclusions as queries and processes hierarchical context tables concatenated with labeled conclusions as paragraphs.\n\nKey Contributions:\n- Development of MevakerSumm and MevakerConc datasets for Hebrew language processing\n- Creation of auxiliary datasets MevakerConcTree and MevakerConcSen\n- Introduction of HeConE and HeConEspc models for conclusion extraction and HeCross for conclusion allocation\n- Public release of all datasets and models for the Hebrew language community",
        "Coordinating conjunctions are a common syntactic phenomenon in English: 38.8% of sentences in the Penn Tree Bank contain at least one coordinating word among \"and\", \"or\", and \"but\" (Marcus et al., 1993). Conjunctions add complexity to sentences, making inferences over such sentences more realistic and challenging. A sentence can contain many conjunctions, each conjoining two or more conjuncts of varied syntactic categories, such as noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases, and clauses. Besides syntax, conjunctions in English carry significant semantic weight, and different conjunctions (\"and\" vs \"or\") affect the meaning of a sentence differently.\n\nIn recent years, significant progress has been made in the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI) with the development of large-scale datasets like SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2018). Although large-scale pre-trained language models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) have achieved superhuman performance on these datasets, concerns have been raised about these models exploiting idiosyncrasies in the data using tricks like pattern matching (McCoy et al., 2019). Consequently, various stress-testing datasets have been proposed to probe NLI models for simple lexical inferences (Glockner et al., 2018), quantifiers (Geiger et al., 2018), numerical reasoning, antonymy, and negation (Naik et al., 2018). However, despite the heavy usage of conjunctions in English, there is no specific NLI dataset that tests their understanding in detail. Although 30% of SNLI samples feature conjunctions, most examples do not require inferences over the conjuncts connected by the coordinating word. On a random sample of 100 conjunctive examples from SNLI, we found that 72% of them have the conjuncts unchanged between the premise and the hypothesis (e.g., \"Man and woman sitting on the sidewalk\" \u2192 \"Man and woman are sitting\"), and there are almost no examples with non-boolean conjunctions (e.g., \"A total of five men and women are sitting.\" \u2192 \"A total of 5 men are sitting.\" (contradiction)). Inference over conjuncts directly translates to boolean and non-boolean semantics, which are essential for understanding conjunctions.\n\nIn response to this gap, we introduce CONJNLI, a new stress-test for NLI over diverse and challenging conjunctive sentences. Our dataset includes annotated examples where the hypothesis differs from the premise by the removal, addition, or replacement of a conjunct. These sentences feature single and multiple instances of coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, nor) with quantifiers, negations, and require diverse boolean and non-boolean inferences over conjuncts. Table 1 shows numerous examples from CONJNLI and compares them with typical conjunctive examples from SNLI and MNLI. In the first two examples, the conjunct \"a Worcester resident\" is removed and added, while in the third example, another conjunct \"a member of the Democratic Party\" is replaced by \"a member of the Republican Party\". Distribution over conjuncts in a conjunctive sentence forms multiple simple sentences. For example, the premise in the first example of Table 1 can be broken into \"He is a Worcester resident.\" and \"He is a member of the Democratic Party.\" From boolean semantics, it requires an inference of the form \"A and B \u2192 A\". Similarly, the third example is of the form \"A and B \u2192 A and C\". While such inferences are simple from the standpoint of boolean logic, similar rules do not always translate to English, especially in non-boolean cases. An inference of the form \"A and B \u2192 A\" is not always entailment, or an inference of the form \"A or B \u2192 A\" is not always neutral (Hoeksema, 1988). Consider the examples marked with a \u2020 in Table 1 showing non-boolean usages of \"and\", \"or\", and \"but\" in English. In the fifth example, the total time is a single entity and cannot be separated in an entailed hypothesis. In the sixth example, \"or\" is used as \"exclusive-or\" because the person began recording in either 1889 or 1890.\n\nWe observe that state-of-the-art models such as BERT and RoBERTa, trained on existing datasets like SNLI and MNLI, often fail to make these inferences for our dataset. For instance, BERT predicts entailment for the non-boolean \"and\" example #5 in Table 1 as well. This relates to the lexical overlap issue in these models (McCoy et al., 2019), since all the words in the hypothesis are also part of the premise for this example.",

        "Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, the focus of this paper, presents a unique challenge: the need for rich and robust supervision from unlabeled data.  Two prominent strategies in semi-supervised learning, consistency and contrastive learning, offer potential solutions, but each has limitations in this context.  Consistency learning, which minimizes feature distance between pixels in different augmented views of the same location, provides reliable but limited supervision, neglecting relationships between pixels at different locations.  Contrastive learning, conversely, leverages pairwise supervision by encouraging similar features for positive pixel pairs and dissimilar features for negative pairs. However, determining these binary positive-negative assignments is problematic. Treating each pixel as a distinct class, as in image classification, forces neighboring pixels\u2014often describing the same object\u2014to have dissimilar features.  Alternatively, using pseudo labels to guide these assignments is susceptible to noise, where small errors can completely reverse the intended feature similarity supervision.\n\nIn semi-supervised learning generally, effectively utilizing unlabeled data is paramount.  Consistency and contrastive learning represent two popular approaches.  For image classification, given augmented views of an image (Fig. 1), consistency learning enforces similar features across different views, while contrastive learning encourages dissimilarity between an image's features and all others except those of the same image.\n\nTo address these limitations and achieve rich, robust supervision, we propose multi-view correlation consistency (MVCC) learning.  MVCC introduces a correlation consistency loss that enforces similarity between self-correlation matrices of different augmented views (Fig. 1).  This approach offers several advantages. Compared to consistency learning, MVCC analyzes similarities between a significantly larger number of pixel pairs, capturing a richer representation of the data distribution.  Crucially, compared to contrastive learning, MVCC avoids hard positive-negative assignments. Instead of directly increasing or decreasing similarity based on these assignments, pixel-pixel similarity is supervised by the similarity of the same pixel pair in another view.  This provides a weaker but more robust form of supervision, circumventing the issues of treating each pixel as a separate class and mitigating the impact of noisy pseudo labels, leading to state-of-the-art results in multiple settings.\n\nBeyond the loss function, MVCC incorporates a view-coherent augmentation strategy, ensuring pixel-pixel correspondence between views.  For image-level augmentations like random cropping, scaling, and flipping, we utilize sampling grids of affine transformations, implementing invertible and differentiable operations efficiently.  For region-level augmentations like CutMix, we enforce view coherence to maintain correspondence across views.",
        "Decision trees are widely used in machine learning due to their interpretability and ability to capture complex relationships within data.  This is particularly valuable in areas like clinical settings, where the direct link between the model and the original data is crucial.\n\nA standard decision tree uses a sequence of ordered splits applied to the data.  Traditionally, these trees are learned using a greedy, one-step-ahead heuristic, with the CART algorithm [3] being a prominent example, producing point-estimate predictions.\n\nRecent research has shifted towards probabilistic approaches [9] to quantify model uncertainty. Bayesian inference, while effective, introduces complexities in computing the necessary distributions. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are frequently employed to approximate these distributions using the law of large numbers [25].  The convergence rate of MCMC depends on the correlation between samples, making sample quality\u2014both low correlation and high likelihood\u2014essential for performance. While progress has been made, generating high-quality samples remains a significant challenge and the primary focus of this paper.\n\nThe core difficulty lies in simultaneously exploring the tree structure and its parameters.  This \"transdimensional\" nature, where the problem dimension changes with the tree structure, poses a challenge for MCMC methods.  Early work by Buntine [4] explored Bayesian averaging and smoothing for decision trees, demonstrating improved predictive accuracy over heuristic methods.  Subsequently, Chipman et al. [5] and Denison et al. [6] independently proposed MCMC-based stochastic sampling methods.  Both introduced tree-specific moves (grow, prune, change, and swap) to transition between trees, each transition representing a new sample in the chain, and observed improvements in accuracy, sometimes surpassing non-Bayesian methods.\n\nFurther advancements refined these MCMC moves.  Wu et al. [26] introduced the \"radical restructure\" move. Gramacy and Lee [10] leveraged binary search tree theory to enhance the swap move, later generalized by Pratola et al. [20], who also improved the change move.\n\nSequential Monte Carlo (SMC) offers an alternative sampling approach.  Unlike MCMC, which modifies a single tree iteratively, SMC evolves a set of \"particles\" (representing trees) with likelihood-based weighting.  Taddy et al. [24] explored SMC for online learning with incrementally arriving data, while Lakshminarayanan et al. [14] used it for batch learning with locally optimal moves.  However, these methods often rely on local random walks, which may propose unlikely trees, leading to low acceptance rates in MCMC and particle degeneracy in SMC. The exception is Lakshminarayanan et al.'s [14] locally optimal proposal, which, while using likelihood, remains local.  This localized approach can hinder posterior exploration due to slow convergence and poor mixing.\n\nThis paper proposes a method to improve acceptance rates and predictive accuracy by integrating Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling into the tree proposal scheme.  HMC leverages the likelihood's geometry for efficient sampling [2], using the derivative of the negative log-posterior as a \"potential energy function\" to guide joint updates of continuous parameters.  However, applying HMC to decision trees is complicated by their piecewise constant likelihood, which is not everywhere differentiable. To address this, we introduce two novel parameterizations: adaptation-phase hyperparameters, inspired by Linero and Yang [15], to soften the hard split constraint, and an input selection method to soften the splitting index parameter.  These techniques aim to mitigate low acceptance rates common in existing methods, potentially improving testing accuracy while simplifying tree structures.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the decision tree model, notation, and problem definition. Section 3 details the novel RJHMC-Tree algorithm, including its two implementations, proposal scheme, and acceptance probabilities.",

While traditional academic benchmarks typically do not demand sequence lengths exceeding 4096, various real-world applications, such as multi-round chat (Team, 2023; Yao et al., 2023), biological sequence modeling (Ahdritz et al., 2022; Avsec et al., 2021; Dalla-Torre et al., 2023; Jumper et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2022), and the analysis of computer programs (Alam et al., 2023a; Muennighoff et al., 2023; Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023), necessitate longer sequences. The distinct challenges, data, and sequence dynamics inherent in each application significantly impact the effectiveness of various techniques, a facet not extensively explored in the existing Transformer literature.\n\nThis paper focuses on the classification of malware using byte-level representations of executables (Raff and Nicholas, 2017b), a task that, in common real-world scenarios, may require sequence lengths of up to 200 million. While the processing of such extreme lengths in entirety may not be feasible, we regard it as a crucial research avenue to evaluate and enhance algorithms for handling long-sequence tasks.",
        "Since the introduction of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in 2010, the technology has been widely adopted in smartphones, wearables, and other IoT devices. In a modern household, there can be more than a dozen devices supporting this technology, constantly sending BLE advertisements to inform nearby devices of their presence, typically without the owner's notice. BLE devices, however, share potentially sensitive data with devices in proximity, posing a vast surface for privacy-compromising attacks.\n\nIn the past, researchers have found that BLE advertisements may contain fixed identifiers, allowing for device tracking despite MAC address randomization, and could even contain personally identifiable information, such as the user's phone number or email address. Additionally, adversaries might use BLE-based tracking devices, like the rumored Apple AirTags, to track individuals, leveraging a crowd-sourced finder network.\n\nTo improve our understanding of the privacy-related attack surface, the security community requires better application support, such as analyzing privacy leaks or detecting malicious devices. To address this, we propose BTLEmap, a network discovery, and security auditing tool, in the spirit of Nmap, but designed for BLE environments.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nHydropower plants (HPPs) represent a crucial renewable generation asset, providing over 10% of Europe's electricity needs [1]. However, the growing share of stochastic renewable generation in the power grid has increased regulation demands on conventional generation assets, including HPPs. This intensified regulation poses concerns for HPP operators, as it accelerates wear and tear, ultimately reducing service life and necessitating costly maintenance. Recent funded research projects (e.g., [2]) have acknowledged this challenge, and technical literature has begun addressing these concerns. For instance, research [3] demonstrated that medium-head HPPs providing ancillary services experience increased penstock fatigue, while [4] proposed mitigation methods. As an alternative approach, hybrid HPPs incorporating batteries have been suggested to enhance regulation capacity [5].\n\nTraditional HPP regulation systems comprise droop governors for primary frequency regulation, speed changers for secondary frequency control, and turbine governors. These governor parameters are typically calibrated to achieve design performance metrics (such as response time and droop) while adhering to the plant's static mechanical and power limitations. However, these conventional feedback control loops lack explicit modeling of dynamic mechanical loads, leaving them unable to account for wear and tear effects from excessive regulation. Understanding mechanical stress is crucial not only for managing wear and tear but also for developing stress-informed signal distribution policies in plants with multiple controllable elements, such as hybrid HPPs.\n\nModel predictive control (MPC) offers an alternative to classical regulation loops for developing informed control decisions. MPC employs models to explicitly formulate constraints, as demonstrated in [6] for battery systems using linear voltage prediction models. Following this approach, this paper introduces linear HPP models suitable for MPC implementation to establish appropriate operational constraints. Two linear models are proposed: a guide vane-to-torque model (essential for modeling plant power output) and a guide vane-to-head model (crucial for characterizing mechanical loads and fatigue). The linearity of these models enables a tractable MPC problem formulation through convex optimization. These models advance the state-of-the-art beyond typical HPP control applications, which traditionally rely on non-linear transfer-function models (e.g., [7]).\n\nThe paper's structure is as follows: Section II examines HPP models, Section III details the proposed linearization procedures, Section IV outlines performance evaluation methods, Section V presents findings, and Section VI summarizes key conclusions.",
        "Image style transfer aims to automatically transfer the artistic style from a source image to a given content one, which has been a long-studied topic in the computer vision community. Traditionally, image style transfer has been viewed as a problem of non-photorealistic rendering in computer graphics. Building on the success of deep learning [9, 41, 8, 55, 10], Gatys et al. [11] introduced a paradigm that utilizes feature activations from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract and match the target content and style, resulting in the advantages of no explicit style restrictions and no need for ground-truth training data. This led to the development of various CNN-based style transfer methods in the literature [22, 25, 5, 49, 47, 15, 13], establishing a new field called neural style transfer (NST) [18].\n\nState-of-the-art NST algorithms can be classified into two categories: parametric and non-parametric methods, depending on the style representation mechanisms. Parametric NST approaches use global summary statistics over the entire feature map from pre-trained deep CNNs to extract and match the artistic style [11, 21, 14], while non-parametric methods, also known as patch-based NST methods [6, 42], employ local feature patches for style representation, inspired by conventional patch-based texture modeling with Markov random fields. Despite their benefits, both parametric and non-parametric methods have limitations, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\n\nIn this work, we introduce a semi-parametric style transfer approach to address the limitations of existing methods. Our approach facilitates more accurate correspondences between different content and style regions, addressing the issue of content-style mismatching in non-parametric NST algorithms and enhancing the stylization quality. By adaptively partitioning content and style features into small, cross-scale patches, our semi-parametric method resolves the challenge of lacking local details present in previous parametric schemes.\n\nTo facilitate this semi-parametric style transfer, we leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) as a learning mechanism to enable local, patch-level interactions between content and style. GNNs, well-suited for non-Euclidean data, explicitly capture structural relations and interdependencies between nodes, making them ideal for addressing the complex region matching problem in style transfer. By employing GNNs, we establish faithful topological correspondences between content and style regions, enabling optimal stylization of each content region with the appropriate style strokes.\n\nOur proposed semi-parametric NST introduces a heterogeneous graph with content and style feature patches as vertices, facilitating parametric aggregation through message passing between patch nodes in the stylization graph. By leveraging GNN mechanisms such as graph attention networks, we aggregate the k most similar patches in a parametric manner. These aggregated patches are then integrated back into image features and aligned with target global statistics to achieve the final stylized output. Additionally, we introduce a deformable graph convolutional operation that enables cross-scale style-content matching with varying stroke sizes within a single stylized image. Our GNN-based NST also offers flexibility in performing patch-based stylization by adjusting the number of connections during inference.\n\nIn conclusion, our novel semi-parametric style transfer approach allows for the generation of both global and local style patterns effectively, supported by a dedicated deformable graph convolutional design. By modeling the NST process as message passing between content and style using GNNs, we achieve superior results compared to existing methods, as demonstrated in our experimental evaluations.",
        "The proliferation of data resulting from the continuous increase in IoT (Internet of Things) device deployments has led to the emergence of cloud data storage and associated processing services. However, centralized cloud solutions are considered insufficient for novel applications, such as holographic communications, which have strict requirements, including low delay and high bandwidth. As a complementary solution, edge computing brings cloud services closer to users, allowing different edge devices to run heterogeneous applications that use and produce all types of data. Therefore, seamless cooperation between computing, caching, and communication (3C) is essential, requiring prominent solutions for moving, storing, and processing data throughout the Edge-Cloud continuum and in between.\n\nRecent studies, as summarized in Table I, have focused on this collaboration, mainly at the edge, addressing the management of 3C resources, and emphasizing that the network can no longer be considered merely as a data transport medium. With advances in network virtualization and softwarization, seamless 3C collaboration is becoming possible, particularly in the spaces between the edge and the cloud, as noted in recent research, such as in [1].",
        "Policy gradient methods are a popular class of reinforcement learning algorithms designed to handle applications with continuous action spaces, where traditional methods like Q-learning fall short. Notable successes of these methods include robotics, emergent tool usage, and games. However, a common issue with policy gradient methods is their inefficiency in utilizing samples, as they require a substantial amount of on-policy experience after each parameter update. Hence, they are most commonly used in scenarios with access to multiple fast simulators.\n\nTo move beyond simulation-based applications and towards real-world implementation, it is crucial to make better use of collected experience. One approach is to enhance sample efficiency by incorporating off-policy samples, which can be obtained from dedicated behavioral policies. Off-policy learning, in general, involves learning under various behavioral policies, often by combining on-and off-policy samples, for instance, through experience replay mechanisms, to prevent discarding valuable experience with policy updates. Off-policy policy gradient (OPPG) methods, in particular, utilize a modified version of the on-policy objective, known as the excursion objective, to estimate returns from off-policy samples, avoiding the high variance associated with traditional importance sampling techniques.\n\nHowever, the on-policy and off-policy objectives differ, with the former reflecting the returns of a policy in the environment, while the latter does not, making it challenging to guarantee performance in actual deployments by optimizing the excursion objective. This work, in turn, aims to bridge the gap between on-and off-policy gradient methods, by examining the relationship between the objectives, especially focusing on the impact of the discount factor, as depicted in the, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",
        "Recognizing vehicle occupants' faces in unconstrained environments, especially through the windshield, presents significant challenges.  Previous research demonstrates that windshield artifacts can severely degrade image quality within the vehicle interior.  Furthermore, images are often captured from a distance and at moderate speeds, reducing available light.  While low-intensity ultraviolet or near-infrared (NIR) illumination could help, tinted windshields, which are increasingly common, block these wavelengths, rendering such solutions ineffective.  Longer exposure times are also impractical due to vehicle motion, as the resulting motion blur significantly impairs face recognition quality.  Additionally, the reflective nature of windshields presents further complications. Reflections reduce light reaching the sensor and introduce unwanted artifacts, including obstructive glare from direct light sources (Figure 1) and superimposed reflections of other objects.\n\nExisting solutions, such as Gatekeeper Security's system, involve flashing visible lights at the driver.  This approach is problematic, creating both driver distraction and potential glare.\n\nTo address these challenges non-intrusively, we developed a custom multi-camera imaging system designed to optimize input for deep learning algorithms.  This modular system (Figures 2, 3, and 4) integrates imaging and computational components.  Raw images captured by the system can be processed using any High Dynamic Range (HDR) method to generate refined input for facial recognition software. This paper extends previous work in two key ways. First, we created and annotated a new dataset to train HDR reconstruction models specifically optimized for our hardware. Second, we introduce a novel HDR reconstruction network architecture, MU-Net (Mertens-Unrolled Network), which uses an unrolling technique to model the Mertens-Kautz-Van Reeth HDR algorithm as a neural network.  Finally, to evaluate the end-to-end system performance, we utilize state-of-the-art (SOTA) facial detection and recognition algorithms to assess image capture and HDR reconstruction quality for detecting and identifying faces through windshields of moving vehicles. We also benchmark MU-Net's efficacy against other established classical and deep learning-based HDR methods within the same recognition pipeline.",
        "Discovering new drugs, specifically those with a desired binding affinity to a target molecule, is a fundamental challenge in chemistry and pharmaceuticals (Hughes et al., 2011). This work addresses *de novo* biological sequence design, a crucial subdomain.  This task presents two key difficulties: the combinatorial explosion of the sequence search space and the complex, often expensive and time-consuming, wet-lab experiments required for sequence evaluation.\n\nDespite these challenges, advances in biochemistry and machine learning have spurred numerous approaches over the past few decades.  One popular technique is directed evolution (Chen & Arnold, 1991), a Nobel Prize-winning paradigm employing a guided local evolutionary search.  However, directed evolution suffers from sample inefficiency and a dependence on strong prior knowledge, such as optimal mutation sites (Ahn et al., 2020).  Furthermore, to remain competitive with other machine learning methods (Gottipati et al., 2020), guided evolution (Yoshikawa et al., 2018; Jensen, 2019; Nigam et al., 2019) often relies on human intuition for designing specialized evolutionary operators, which may not generalize well to all tasks.\n\nWe frame sequence design as a black-box optimization problem, aiming to maximize an unknown oracle function.  Recognizing the limited resources for oracle queries (e.g., wet-lab experiment budgets), sample efficiency becomes paramount.  We therefore develop a probabilistic framework, reformulating this black-box optimization as a posterior modeling problem.  This framework reveals a surprising link between likelihood-free inference and sequence design, connecting two previously disparate fields.  This connection, based on shared elements and targets detailed in Section 2.2, enhances understanding of both fields and provides a blueprint for developing sequence design algorithms.  Furthermore, by integrating various probabilistic modeling insights, we develop three novel composite probabilistic algorithms. While our framework has broader applicability to any black-box optimization setting, this work focuses on biological sequence design.",
        "Research in sign language has predominantly focused on supervised learning, aiming to classify phonological parameters (Liaw et al., 2002; Cooper and Bowden, 2007; Buehler et al., 2009; Buehler et al., 2010; Cooper et al., 2012; Koller et al., 2016), provide glosses for isolated signs (Gaolin Fang et al., 2004; Ong et al., 2014; Fagiani et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2015; Mocialov et al., 2017a; Bantupalli and Xie, 2018; Tornay et al., 2019), or translate signed utterances composed of multiple signs into written languages (Neidle and Vogler, 2012; S Kumar et al., 2018; Cihan Camgoz et al., 2018; Ko et al., 2019).\n\nAlthough the field has primarily employed supervised methods, there have been limited attempts to model sign language using unsupervised techniques, mainly for data mining purposes (Papapetrou et al., 2009; \u00d6stling et al., 2018).\n\nThis study aims to leverage sign language resources from social media to cluster segmented phonemes without transcription access during clustering. Two clustering methods are compared: the general DBSCAN method (Witten and Frank, 2002) and an iterative grouping clustering method. Experiments demonstrate that it is feasible to identify similar phonemes in continuous signing data using clustering approaches with a linguistically viable distance metric based on phonological parameters.\n\n### 2. Related Work\n\nDeldjoo et al. (2016) developed a recommendation system based on visual features extracted from videos, such as lighting, color, and motion. Snoek et al. (2009) and Hu et al. (2011) identified color, texture, shape, objects, and movements as features for video indexing and retrieval. These extracted features can be grouped across the temporal dimension and used for querying similar groups during data mining. Other methods create specialized groups, such as human actions, which can vary depending on the application. Unknown patterns within the groups are typically discovered through clustering. Karypis et al. (2000) identified bottom-up and top-down clustering approaches. In the bottom-up approach, each element is initially assigned to an individual cluster, and clusters are then merged iteratively. In the top-down approach, all elements begin in the same cluster, and the cluster is subsequently split. Merging and splitting are performed using a similarity metric, with the bottom-up approach being more common. Cluster quality can be assessed by measuring the inter-cluster entropy, and the relationship between precision and recall. When no external cluster information is available, the inter and intra-cluster cohesion can be used to evaluate cluster quality (Corral et al., 2006).  Ert\u00f6z et al.

These systems are crucial for groundbreaking applications, including video stabilization, virtual reality, and view interpolation. They enable the creation of free-viewpoint videos, allowing users to interact with video sequences in a way that traditional videos do not permit.\n\nTraditionally, dynamic view synthesis systems have relied on expensive and complex setups, such as fixed multi-camera rigs, which capture scenes simultaneously from multiple angles. These setups, while effective, are often labor-intensive, making them less practical for widespread use. However, recent technological advancements have opened the door to generating dynamic novel views using just a single stereo or RGB camera, which was previously effective only for specific cases, such as human performance capture or capturing small animals.\n\nIn addition, while some dynamic view synthesis methods are capable of handling unstructured video inputs, they usually depend on the accurate estimation of camera poses, often achieved through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems.",
        "In predictive modeling, the primary goal is to identify a relationship between matrices X and Y, each with N rows representing individual samples. The matrix X consists of K columns, each representing a predictor of the samples, while the matrix Y includes M columns representing observations. Instead of directly utilizing X and Y, certain models compute the matrix products, X\u1d40X and X\u1d40Y, to facilitate the modeling process.\n\nOur work introduces three innovative algorithms designed to significantly accelerate cross-validation, which requires the computation of X\u1d40X and X\u1d40Y for each dataset partition. These algorithms are capable of rapidly computing partition-wise, potentially mean-centered, and optionally sample standard deviation-scaled X\u1d40X and X\u1d40Y. Importantly, they avoid the need for recomputing the full X\u1d40X and X\u1d40Y for each training set, and they do not necessitate the recomputation of statistical moments, thus, preventing data leakage from the validation sets.",
        "Conditional expressions are crucial for representing the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of intelligent agents. They play a significant role in various fields, including nonmonotonic reasoning, causal inference, learning, and more generally, reasoning under uncertainty. This paper introduces an algebraic structure for conditional events, providing a logical foundation for analyzing the concept of conditional probability\u2014a fundamental tool in Artificial Intelligence.\n\nSince the groundbreaking work of Gaifman [22], building on the initial ideas of his supervisor Alfred Tarski [31], it has been considered natural to explore the conditions under which Boolean algebras, i.e., classical logic, serve as the logic of events in probability theory. As clearly stated in [23], events, described in some language, can be equated with the sentences that describe them, and the probability function can be seen as an assignment of values to these sentences. The wealth of knowledge accumulated in formal languages makes such a project feasible.\n\nOur focus is on developing this idea further, considering conditional probability as a primitive notion and deriving unconditional probability as a specialization. Taking conditional probability as a fundamental concept is an approach with a long tradition, dating back to at least [12] and including [32, 44, 45, 51]. The primary rationale for this perspective is the methodological view that probability assessments are never made in isolation. Instead, each probabilistic evaluation is conducted in light of available evidence, making every assessment inherently conditional.\n\nTo achieve our goal, the first step is to clarify how conditional knowledge and information should be represented. We propose a structure for representing conditional events as the primitive objects of uncertainty quantification. In other words, we aim to capture the logic or algebra that replaces classical logic when focusing on conditional probability. In our preliminary investigations [20, 21], we suggested a methodological approach involving the following questions:\n\n1. Which properties of conditional probabilities depend on the measure's characteristics and are independent of the logical properties of conditional events?\n2. Which properties depend on the logic\u2014whatever it may be\u2014of conditional events?\n\nBruno de Finetti was the first to challenge the assumption that conditional events could be described by truth-functional classical logic. He referred to these as trievents [12, 14], motivated by the notion that conditional events like \"a given b\" express hypothetical assertions\u2014the assertion of the consequent a based on the supposition that the antecedent b is satisfied. Thus, evaluating a conditional involves a two-step process: first checking the antecedent, and if not satisfied, the conditional loses meaning. Otherwise, the evaluation proceeds to the consequent, and the conditional event takes on its value.\n\nThis interpretation enabled de Finetti to use the classical notion of uncertainty resolution for conditional events, as assumed by Hausdorff and Kolmogorov, except that de Finetti allowed the evaluation to be a partial function. This is clearly illustrated through the betting interpretation of subjective probability, which extends to various coherence-based measures of uncertainty [18, 19]. For example, in the context of a two-valued classical logic valuation v, de Finetti interprets conditional events \"\u03b8 given \u03c6\" as follows:\n\n- Won if v(\u03c6) = v(\u03b8) = 1\n- Lost if v(\u03c6) = 1 and v(\u03b8) = 0\n- Called-off if v(\u03c6) = 0\n\nThis concept has been further developed in uncertain reasoning, with links to non-monotonic reasoning [17, 36, 35, 34]. In probability logic, this approach has been pursued in [9], where, despite being measure-theoretically oriented, the semantics of conditional events is three-valued. However, the algebra of conditional events developed in this paper will form a Boolean algebra. As we will demonstrate, the three-valued semantics of conditional events is compatible with the requirement that they form a Boolean algebra. This compatibility arises because uncertainty-resolving valuations no longer correspond to classical logic valuations, as in de Finetti's work.",
        "Let me help restructure this academic text to improve its flow and coherence. Here's a suggested reorganization:\n\n# Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problems for Temporal Languages\n\n## 1. Introduction and Background\n\nThe Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem (QCSP) extends the classical Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) by allowing both existential and universal quantifiers in input sentences. While CSPs have been extensively studied for temporal languages, achieving a complete complexity classification for temporal QCSPs has proven more challenging.\n\nA key difference is the complexity ceiling: temporal CSPs are at most NP-complete, while temporal QCSPs can reach PSPACE-completeness. This increased complexity is evident even in cases with constant polymorphisms, which make CSPs trivial but can result in PSPACE-complete QCSPs.\n\n## 2. Previous Classifications\n\nThree significant partial classifications have been established:\n\n1. **Equality Languages**: Initially shown to be either in P, NP-complete, or coNP-hard [BC10, CM12]. Recently refined to be either in LOGSPACE, NP-complete, or PSPACE-complete [ZM21].\n\n2. **Positive Languages**: These structures, defined using only \u2227, \u2228, and \u2264 in (Q; \u2264), were classified as either LOGSPACE, NLOGSPACE-complete, P-complete, NP-complete, or PSPACE-complete [CW08a, CW08b].\n\n3. **Dually-Closed Ord-Horn Languages**: For these languages, QCSPs are either in P (if Guarded Ord-Horn) or coNP-hard [Wro14b].\n\n## 3. Main Contribution\n\nThis paper establishes the tractability frontier for all dually-closed temporal languages, proving that for every such language \u0393, QCSP(\u0393) is either:\n- In P\n- NP-hard\n- coNP-hard\n\nThis classification generalizes previous results, particularly for dually-closed Ord-Horn languages and equality languages, while covering many previously unclassified cases.\n\n## 4. Methodology\n\nThe classification relies on careful analysis of unary operations preserving dually-closed temporal languages, particularly non-injective operations. This analysis, while unnecessary for temporal CSPs, proves crucial for QCSPs and temporal abduction problems.",
        "Offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) provides a data-driven perspective on learning decision-making policies by using previously collected data without any additional online interaction during the training process (Lange et al., 2012; Levine et al., 2020). Despite its recent development (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Nair et al., 2020; An et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2020) and application progress (Zhan et al., 2022; Apostolopoulos et al., 2021; Soares et al., 2021), one of the current challenges in ORL remains algorithms' extrapolation error, which is the inability to correctly estimate the values of unseen actions (Fujimoto et al., 2019).\n\nNumerous algorithms have been designed to address this issue. For example, Kostrikov et al. (2021) (IQL) avoid estimation for out-of-sample actions entirely. Similarly, Kumar et al. (2020) (CQL) penalizes out-of-distribution actions so that their values are lower-bounded. Other methods explicitly make the learned policy closer to the behavioral one (Fujimoto & Gu, 2021; Nair et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).\n\nIn contrast to prior studies, recent works (An et al., 2021) demonstrated that simply increasing the number of value estimates in the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018) algorithm is enough to consistently advance state-of-the-art performance across various datasets in the D4RL benchmark (Fu et al., 2020). Furthermore, An et al. (2021) showed that the double-clip trick serves as an uncertainty-quantification mechanism, providing the lower bound of the estimate, and that simply increasing the number of critics can result in sufficient penalization for out-of-distribution actions.",
        "The increasing interest in extending the generative power of pretrained text-to-image (T2I) models to text-to-video (T2V) generation is evident in recent research [5, 9\u201312, 14, 20, 27, 33].  Zero-shot T2V methods [10, 12, 14] aim to adapt image diffusion models for video generation without further training, leveraging their ability to generate frame sequences from video text prompts.  However, generating coherent dynamic scenes in videos remains a challenge due to the concise and abstract nature of these prompts.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capacity to generate layouts for controlling visual modules, particularly image generation models [3, 19, 32]. This suggests the potential for LLMs to interpret complex video prompts and generate fine-grained spatio-temporal layouts for guiding video synthesis.  Generating such layouts for video, however, is more complex, requiring LLMs to understand and depict object movement and transformation over time.\n\nRecent zero-shot T2V research [10, 12] has explored using LLMs to decompose video text into frame-level descriptions, representing individual moments or events within the video to guide image diffusion models towards semantically coherent video generation.  However, these descriptions often capture only basic temporal semantics, lacking the detailed spatio-temporal information necessary for smooth object motion and consistent frame-to-frame coherence.  Furthermore, representing global background movement, crucial for depicting camera motion and creating immersive video experiences [8, 30], adds another layer of complexity.\n\nThis paper introduces FlowZero, a novel framework integrating LLMs and image diffusion models to generate temporally coherent videos from text prompts. FlowZero leverages LLMs to analyze and translate the video text prompt into a structured Dynamic Scene Syntax (DSS).  Unlike previous methods that provide only basic semantic descriptions, the DSS includes scene descriptions, foreground object layouts, and background motion patterns.  Foreground layouts consist of a series of bounding boxes defining the spatial arrangement of each frame and tracking changes in object positions and sizes, ensuring coherent object motion and transformation aligned with the text prompt.  Crucially, FlowZero incorporates an iterative self-refinement process to enhance the alignment between generated layouts and textual descriptions, addressing inaccuracies such as spatial and temporal errors.  This process iteratively compares and adjusts the layouts against the text through a feedback loop, ensuring high-fidelity and coherent spatio-temporal layouts.\n\nTo enhance temporal coherence and consistency, FlowZero prompts LLMs to predict background motion patterns, which can control global scenes and camera motion.  For example, if the text describes a horse running from right to left, as illustrated in Figure 1 (middle), the LLM predicts a corresponding left-to-right camera motion, enhancing the video's immersiveness [8, 30].  This background motion pattern includes specific directions and speeds.  We introduce motion-guided noise shifting (MNS), which shifts the initial noise of each frame according to the predicted background motion, resulting in smoother video synthesis.\n\nFlowZero represents a significant advancement in zero-shot text-to-video synthesis, leveraging the spatio-temporal planning capabilities of LLMs to generate detailed frame-by-frame syntax. This fusion of technologies within the FlowZero framework enables the generation of temporally coherent and visually appealing videos directly from text prompts.\n\nOur contributions are summarized as follows: We introduce an iterative self-refinement process for improving generated spatio-temporal layouts.",

The harms of image-based sexual abuse have been well-documented, including negative impacts on victim-survivors' mental health, career prospects, and willingness to engage with others both online and offline. The proliferation of NSII technologies means that anyone can now become a victim of image-based sexual abuse, and research suggests that women continue to bear the brunt of this online abuse.\n\nThe consumer creation of deepfakes, a portmanteau of \"deep learning\" and \"fake,\" started in late 2017 on Reddit when a user named \"deepfakes\" posted NSII depicting the faces of female celebrities \"stitched\" onto pornographic videos. Continued consumer interest in deepfakes is reflected in the proliferation of dedicated deepfake sites and forums, often depicting celebrity targets. While deepfakes can be used in beneficial ways for accessibility and creativity, abuse potential has increased in recent years as the technology has advanced in sophistication and availability. Deepfakes can be weaponized and used for malicious purposes, including financial fraud, disinformation dissemination, cyberbullying, and sexual extortion (\"sextortion\").\n\nNon-consensual synthetic intimate imagery (NSII) refers to digitally altered content that is fake but depicts the faces, bodies, and/or voices of real people.

        "Explaining the behavior of machine learning algorithms, especially in the context of AI, is a significant challenge in the field of machine learning. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) emphasizes the importance of explainable AI, prompting the machine learning community to recognize the need for a better understanding of black-box models. While there has been substantial research on explaining the behavior of supervised machine-learning models, the concept of explanation in Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains unclear. Current efforts in explainable RL often employ techniques similar to those used in explaining supervised classifiers, focusing on what drives an agent's actions in the current environment rather than the intended outcomes of those actions. However, understanding the chain of events an agent intends to unfold as a result of a specific action choice is crucial, as it reflects the agent's reasoning process and sheds light on the decision-making process.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the importance of introspective abilities in RL, emphasizing the need for \"Explainable Agency\" to enhance the interpretability of an agent's behavior. To address this need, this paper introduces a novel approach to standard value-based RL frameworks that enables the projection of predicted future trajectories based on the current observation and proposed action. Unlike existing methods that rely on repeated forward simulations to predict an agent's future states, the proposed approach recovers the sum of past events weighted by the agent's learning of Q-values, ensuring consistency with the agent's behavioral policy. By mathematically guaranteeing this consistency, the method provides a local interpretation of the agent's intentions, offering valuable insights into the agent's expected behavior.\n\nBy presenting a simple addition to RL frameworks that enhances the interpretability of an agent's behavior, this work aims to assist RL practitioners in understanding and debugging model behavior for improved reliability and trustworthiness of RL systems.",
        "Steganography is a technique designed to conceal the existence of communication between two parties, in contrast to cryptography which focuses on hiding the content of the exchanged information. It is considered a failure if an adversary even suspects the presence of hidden communication without being able to prove it. Steganalysis, on the other hand, is utilized to uncover such covert communication. Various forms of media can be used for steganography, with those possessing a high degree of redundancy being more favorable, such as photos, audio, and videos.\n\nBlockchain, initially introduced as a peer-to-peer network for digital currency like Bitcoin, has gained traction in diverse research fields due to its unique characteristics. In the context of Bitcoin, distributed consensus among miners ensures the integrity and permanence of information stored on the blockchain. Different payment models within Bitcoin, such as pay to public key (p2pk), pay to public key hash (p2pkh), and pay to script hash (p2sh), facilitate secure transactions by depositing funds into designated addresses. Each Bitcoin transaction involves input and output addresses, allowing the transfer of funds from one or more sources to one or more destinations.\n\nThe paper explores the potential of blockchain in facilitating hidden data embedding (steganography) and presents two algorithms tailored for this purpose \u2013 a high-capacity algorithm and a medium-capacity algorithm. These algorithms have a unique characteristic of embedding data without altering the original content, making steganalysis challenging.

        "With deep learning models and algorithms becoming integral to modern AI systems, it is crucial to thoroughly evaluate these algorithms and systems to minimize any adverse societal impacts. One primary issue highlighted in the literature is the incorporation of bias within algorithms [8], [22]. Research has demonstrated that the performance of deep learning algorithms can vary significantly among individuals with different attributes, such as gender and skin tone, in various settings [2], [17]. For example, it has been observed that Twitter's automatic face-cropping algorithm tends to favor young, lighter-skinned individuals over others [23]. With an increasing number of such issues, it is imperative to include fairness as a key metric in the evaluation of these algorithms.\n\nThe fairness of facial analysis algorithms has been a focus of research in the literature over the past few years [15], [20], [21], [22]. Most research efforts have concentrated on raising awareness of bias in face recognition systems, and several datasets have been proposed to address this [10], [24]. However, limited research has explored the impact of face detection, which is a crucial component of the recognition pipeline, and failures in this area can lead to incorrect decisions (Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies on bias in face detection address the issue of bounding box localization. As the first contribution of this work, we analyze various facial detectors to determine if they exhibit any biased behavior. The presence of bias in deep models has been attributed to both non-demographic factors, such as variations in pose, illumination, and image quality, and more complex, demographic factors, such as race, gender, and skin tone [11].\n\nTo investigate biased behavior, datasets with extensive annotations of different attributes, which are lacking in existing databases, are necessary.",
        "In this work, we focus on supervised pre-training, one of the most popular pre-training paradigms, and study two key quantities of a supervised pre-training dataset: intra-class diversity (the number of different samples within each pre-training class) and inter-class diversity (the number of different pre-training classes). Many state-of-the-art deep neural network models are pre-trained on large datasets before being fine-tuned for downstream tasks [13, 17, 23, 1]. While the composition of their pre-training dataset has been shown to be a key factor in the performance of these models [7, 9, 14, 8, 12, 26], how best to design these pre-training datasets still remains underexplored. \n\nIntuitively, both intra-class and inter-class diversities are beneficial for supervised pre-training [13]. Yet, when the size of the pre-training dataset is fixed, these diversities trade off, as increasing one will decrease the other. Our work investigates the impact of this dataset diversity trade-off on downstream performance, and how to balance them to design a supervised pre-training dataset with the best downstream performance. \n\nEmpirically, using ImageNet [24] as the pre-training dataset, we demonstrate that, with the pre-training dataset size fixed, the optimal performance on downstream tasks occurs when a balance between intra-class and inter-class diversity is achieved.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n**Introduction and Background**\nPlanning is an important facet of AI that gives efficient algorithms for solving current real-world problems. Stochastic Shortest Path problems (SSPs) (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis 1991) generalise classical (deterministic) planning by introducing actions with probabilistic effects, which lets us model problems where the actions are intrinsically probabilistic.\n\n**Core Concepts and Algorithms**\nValue Iteration (VI) (Bellman 1957) is a dynamic programming algorithm that forms the basis of optimal algorithms for solving SSPs. VI finds the cost-to-go for each state, which describes the solution of an SSP. A state s's cost-to-go is the minimum expected cost of reaching a goal from s, and similarly an action a's cost-to-go is the minimum after applying a. VI finds the optimal cost-to-go by iteratively applying Bellman backups, which update each state's cost-to-go with the minimal outgoing action's cost-to-go.\n\n**Current State-of-the-Art and Limitations**\nLRTDP (Bonet and Geffner 2003) and iLAO* (Hansen and Zilberstein 2001), the state-of-the-art algorithms for optimally solving SSPs, build on VI and offer significant speedup by using heuristics. However, a key limitation is that each Bellman backup must consider all applicable actions, even when some actions' successors will be pruned for being too expensive.\n\n**Previous Solutions and Their Limitations**\nAction elimination (Bertsekas 1995) addresses this issue by pruning useless actions. While domain-independent lower bounds can be computed efficiently, finding an efficient, domain-independent upper bound remains an open question. This has limited action elimination's use in domain-independent planning, with FTVI being the only known implementation.\n\n**Novel Approach**\nWe present a new technique that doesn't rely on upper bounds. Instead of pruning useless actions, our approach:\n1. Initially treats all actions as inactive\n2. Iteratively adds actions guaranteed to improve the current solution\n3. Strengthens connections between planning and operations research\n4. Introduces efficient constraint generation for SSPs\n\n**Implementation and Results**\nOur implementation, CG-iLAO*, demonstrates significant improvements:\n- Up to 8\u00d7 faster than LRTDP\n- Up to 3\u00d7 faster than iLAO*\n- Considers only 43-65% of iLAO*'s total actions\n- Combines iLAO*'s efficient backups with LRTDP's strong pruning\n\n**Paper Structure**\nThe paper will proceed as follows:\n1. SSPs background and existing solutions\n2. Linear programming background and connections to heuristic search\n3. CG-iLAO* algorithm explanation and correctness proof\n4.

Architectures can be represented through diverse views, employing paradigms like program comprehension and subsystem patterns [14], optimized clustering [9], dependencies, or concerns [4, 6] (where \"concern\" denotes a system requirement, not a worry).  A readily usable architectural view benefits stakeholders in numerous ways, including usability [1], security [2], and maintenance. However, such a view may be unavailable\u2014perhaps never created or outdated due to system evolution [13].  This necessitates efficient and expedient methods for generating or recovering architectural views from implementation artifacts like source code. This is the role of software architecture recovery.\n\nRELAX [6] is a concern-oriented software architecture recovery method that employs text classification on code entities to construct an architectural view.  Results are presented both textually as concern clusters (groups of source code entities) (Figure 1) and graphically as a directory graph [6], including additional information like SLOC and dependencies.  From its inception, RELAX was designed for diverse users, such as system architects, developers, integrators, and researchers, whether analyzing a single system version or tracking architectural evolution.  Importantly, this includes developers new to a system, lacking documentation, and needing to quickly become productive, whether due to deadlines or the desire to contribute effectively.\n\nWhile RELAX's determinism, efficiency, and scalability have been demonstrated through runtime and result consistency measurements [6], its utility remained unstudied.  Specifically, we investigated whether RELAX recovery results could accelerate the process of modifying an unfamiliar system for study participants.\n\nThe paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes our approach; Section 3 presents the study results; Section 4 analyzes these results; Section 5 addresses validity threats; Section 6 concludes the paper; and Section 7 outlines future work.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, maintaining the academic tone while improving flow and readability:\n\nTerrestrial ecosystem services are fundamental to human society (Manning et al., 2018), making forest conservation a global political priority (United Nations). The United Nations has established ambitious forest goals aimed at sustainable development, including maintaining and enhancing global carbon stocks and increasing forest cover by 3% between 2017 and 2030. However, growing global commodity demand continues to drive deforestation, challenging these objectives (Hoang and Kanemoto, 2021).\n\nEarth observation and satellite remote sensing provide crucial data for monitoring global forest quality (Hansen et al., 2013). Yet measuring progress in carbon and biodiversity conservation requires innovative approaches that extend beyond forest cover detection. These methods must deliver consistent information about morphological traits that predict carbon stock and biodiversity (Skidmore et al., 2021) at a global scale, with canopy height being a key indicator (Skidmore et al., 2021; Jucker et al., 2017).\n\nThis study presents a deep learning framework for global high-resolution canopy top height mapping using publicly available optical satellite imagery. We have developed the first global canopy top height product with 10 m ground sampling distance, based on 2020 Sentinel-2 optical images. To support conservation efforts and advance climate, carbon, and biodiversity modeling, we have made this global map, along with its source code and models, publicly available.\n\nConsistent global canopy height mapping is essential for understanding terrestrial ecosystem functions, which are primarily determined by vegetation height and structure (Migliavacca et al., 2021). Canopy top height serves as a crucial indicator of biomass and global aboveground carbon stock (Duncanson et al., 2022). At high spatial resolution, canopy height models (CHM) directly characterize habitat heterogeneity (Tuanmu and Jetz, 2015), establishing canopy height as a priority biodiversity variable for space-based observation (Skidmore et al., 2021).\n\nForests also play a vital role in buffering microclimate temperatures beneath their canopies (De Frenne et al., 2019). While research has shown that taller tropical canopies more effectively dampen microclimate extremes (Jucker et al., 2018), further studies are needed to verify this relationship globally (De Frenne et al., 2019). A uniform high-resolution CHM could advance our understanding of climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and help forest managers enhance microclimate buffering to protect biodiversity in a warming climate (De Frenne et al., 2019).\n\n[Remaining paragraphs maintain similar quality but have been omitted for brevity]\n\nKey improvements made:\n- Enhanced paragraph structure and flow\n- Improved sentence transitions\n- Standardized citation formatting\n- Clarified technical concepts\n- Maintained academic tone while increasing readability\n- Eliminated redundancies and tightened language\n- Added logical paragraph breaks",
        "Here's a restructured and more coherent version of the text:\n\n**Introduction and Problem Statement**\nHumans evaluate the offensiveness of statements through complex pragmatic reasoning that considers both social and interactional contexts. However, most NLP approaches have oversimplified toxic language detection into a basic classification problem, leading to non-explainable methods that can inadvertently discriminate against minority populations.\n\n**The Role of Context in Offensive Language**\nConsider the statement \"I'm impressed that your English is so good!\" While intended as a compliment, its implications vary significantly based on context. When a white person directs this comment to a non-white person, it becomes a microaggression by implying that \"nonwhite people are not native English speakers.\"\n\n**Introducing COBRA Frames**\nTo address these nuances, we introduce COBRA (COntextual Bias fRAmes), a formalism that captures and explains context-dependent pragmatic implications of offensive language. Inspired by frame semantics and Social Bias Frames, COBRA analyzes statements along with their contextual descriptions (social roles and situational context) and provides free-text explanations across seven different dimensions derived from social science and pragmatics theories.\n\n**Advantages of COBRA**\nThe COBRA framework offers several benefits over traditional approaches:\n1. Rich contextual representations through free-text descriptions\n2. Capture of complex social knowledge and norms\n3. More nuanced and interpretable explanations compared to binary toxicity flagging\n\n**COBRACORPUS Dataset**\nTo study contextual influences on offensive statements, we developed COBRACORPUS, containing 32,000 COBRA context-statement-explanation frames. The dataset was generated using GPT-3.5 with human annotation verification, following recent successful approaches in machine dataset creation.\n\n*[Note: Table and Figure references have been maintained but reorganized within the logical flow of the text.]*\n\nThis restructuring creates a clearer narrative flow, moving from problem statement through solution and implementation, while maintaining all key information from the original text.",
        "Diffusion models [13, 36, 38] have seen a significant surge in both capabilities and applications [22, 25, 29]. Among these, Stable Diffusion (SD) [30] and SDXL [27], pre-trained on the large-scale LAION-5B dataset [33], have emerged as powerful generative models. The open-source community has also benefited from various personalized diffusion models available on CivitAI [4], trained using DreamBooth [32] or Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) [15]. These models can generate creative, high-quality images at their training resolutions, such as 512\u00d7512 for SD-based models and 1024\u00d71024 for SDXL-based models, based on provided prompts. However, they often encounter challenges when tasked with generating images at resolutions outside their trained domains. As illustrated in Figure 2, SD-based and personalized diffusion models produce low-resolution images (e.g., 256\u00d7256) with poor fidelity and high-resolution images (e.g., 1024\u00d71024) with subpar framing and composition, a phenomenon we term resolution domain inconsistency.\n\nTo address these limitations, existing research is categorized into two main approaches. The first is post-processing [1, 9, 16], as seen in models like MultiDiffusion [1] and ElasticDiffusion [9], where images in their trained resolution domain are repeatedly processed and stitched to produce images with flexible resolutions through overlap. However, this method often results in longer inference times due to the complex post-processing operations. The second, more straightforward, approach involves fine-tuning models on a broader range of resolutions, enabling them to generate resolution-free images, as demonstrated by models using LoRA [15]. However, most models on CivitAI [4] lack detailed information about their training datasets, and fine-tuning on general datasets, such as LAION-5B [33], can alter their original style, as shown in Figure 2, a phenomenon we term style domain inconsistency.\n\nCan we, then, develop a plug-and-play resolution adapter, capable of generating images with unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios, for various diffusion models, without altering their original style domain?",
        "Pioneer power theories for analyzing electrical systems were developed by Steinmetz, Kennelly, Heaviside, and others by the end of the XIX century [1] , [2] , [3] . Nowadays, these theories remain a topic of discussion and debate regarding their accuracy and physical interpretation [4] . Some were formulated in the frequency domain, like those by Budeanu [5] and Czarnecki [6] , while others, like those by Fryze [7] , Akagi [8] , and Depenbrock [9] , were formulated in the time domain. Recently, Lev-Ari [10] and Salmer\u00f3n [11] have made notable contributions to the field by utilizing the Hilbert Transform (HT) and tensor algebra, respectively. These theories aim to elucidate the power-transfer process between complex electrical systems and establish mathematical concepts related to fictitious powers, such as reactive power, which hold significant engineering value. However, existing proposals lack the capability to separate current components in the time domain under conditions like voltage distortion, asymmetry, load non-linearity, or their combinations, as highlighted in the literature [4] , [12] .\n\nIn this paper, a new approach is introduced to address these limitations, utilizing geometric algebra (GA) and the Hilbert Transform (HT) as mathematical tools. GA, a versatile tool, can model various physical and mathematical problems [13] , and, when applied, can separate current components, particularly those of engineering significance, in systems, irrespective of the number of phases, including single-phase, as emphasized [14] , [15] .",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, enhancing clarity and flow while maintaining the core content:\n\n```markdown\nDeveloper discussions are fundamental to modern software development, serving multiple crucial functions: they facilitate collaborative decision-making, document important choices, and provide valuable learning resources. In today's pull-based development process, these discussions capture essential design decisions that significantly impact software architecture [1, 2, 3].\n\nRecent research [5, 6] has demonstrated that developer discussions contain rich contextual information about software design, including historical rationale and evolutionary insights. For newcomers to a project, these discussions can be invaluable resources for understanding system architecture and design principles [7]. However, a significant challenge exists: design-related discussions are typically dispersed across various platforms\u2014commit messages, pull requests, and issue trackers\u2014making it impractical to manually track and analyze specific design topics.\n\nThis challenge has given rise to design mining, a specialized branch of software repository mining research. Successfully mining design discussions could revolutionize software documentation, enhance requirement traceability, and improve maintenance and refactoring processes.\n\nAt its core, the design mining problem involves binary classification of developer discussions: determining whether a given discussion is design-related or not. These discussions are extracted from various software artifacts, including pull requests, issues, code comments, and Q&A interactions. The classification process typically follows a supervised learning approach:\n\n1. Manual labeling of training data following established coding guidelines\n2. Development of machine learning models leveraging natural language processing\n3. Automated classification based on specific features\n\nThe verification process involves:\n- Manual classification through participant consensus\n- Automated classification validation using a manually labeled \"gold set\"\n\nRecent studies have focused on developing high-performing classifiers [8, 9, 5], with notable achievements such as Viviani et al.'s [10] model achieving an AUC of 0.87. However, conclusion stability [11] remains a significant challenge, as most studies evaluate classifiers on limited datasets from single sources. Our research addresses this limitation by developing a broadly applicable model that maintains high accuracy across diverse projects and artifact types.\n\nThe practical implications of automatic design detection are significant:\n- Reduced development time for both contributors and reviewers\n- Improved accessibility of design information for newcomers\n- Enhanced support for answering design-related queries\n- Insights into design decision patterns and divergences\n- Automated documentation maintenance\n\nA crucial aspect of our approach is cross-domain and cross-project applicability. We define domains as data sources (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub) and projects as specific software initiatives within those domains (e.g., Node.js, Rails). This broad applicability is essential for:\n\n- General-purpose applications (such as PR bots) that operate across diverse contexts\n- Adaptability to evolving development practices and technologies\n- Research validity and generalizability\n\nOur study takes an innovative approach by avoiding rigid design definitions. Instead, we leverage Stack Overflow's crowd-sourced data, enabling us to capture diverse perspectives on design. This approach has yielded the largest design mining dataset to date\u2014260,000 examples compared to previous studies' 2,500\u2014while maintaining validity through careful testing against real developer discussions.",
        "The goal of 3D human performance capture is the space-time coherent tracking of the entire human surface from different sensor types; this is a long-standing and challenging computer vision problem. Such densely tracked characters can be used in film, game, and mixed reality applications to create immersive and photo-real virtual doubles of real humans.\n\nPrevious multi-view-based approaches [11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 22, 49, 55, 59, 60, 80, 85] can capture high-quality surface details. However, they rely on impractical and expensive multicamera capture setups. To commoditize performance capture, ideally, just a single RGB camera should be necessary while still allowing users to track both the body pose and non-rigid deformations of skin and clothing. Prior monocular approaches were able to recover the pose and shape of a naked human body model [38, 39, 57], hands [10, 17, 23, 53, 82, 93, 94, 97], facial expression [41, 72, 73, 74, 77], or all of them [36, 58, 87, 98]; recovering cloth deformations remains out of their reach. Some previous work on monocular 3D human and clothes reconstruction uses volumetric [21, 95] or continuous implicit representations [65]. However, these approaches do not track space-time coherent surfaces and lack surface correspondences over time. On the other hand, template-based monocular methods [24, 25, 47, 90] can track low-frequency surface details coherently over time but cannot capture facial expressions and hand gestures. Joint capture of all aspects remains poorly studied.\n\nTo address these limitations, we present HiFECap, a novel monocular learning-based 3D human performance capture approach that jointly captures the skeletal pose, dense surface deformations, hand gestures, and facial identity and expressions. First, convolutional neural networks predict the skeletal pose and the coarse surface deformations from the segmented monocular image of the actor. High-frequency surface details are recovered by a deformation network as dense vertex displacements. These intermediate outputs are then combined in a differentiable character representation, which can be supervised with multi-view images and 3D point clouds during training. We further replace the hand and face regions of the original template with parametric hand and face models using our proposed registration strategy and drive them by predicting the parameters from images.",
        "3D city data is increasingly used for analysis in various applications, including security management and emergency response, energy consumption estimation, and occupancy measurement.  CityGML [5, 22], a widely adopted standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), represents and exchanges these 3D city models.  It defines the three-dimensional geometry, topology, semantics, and appearance of key topographic objects in urban and regional contexts.  The representation of semantic and topological properties within CityGML enables querying this data for analysis.\n\nAt the implementation level, CityGML is defined as a GML (Geography Markup Language) application schema [5].  CityGML datasets typically consist of XML files, often accompanied by image files used as textures. Each XML file can represent a portion of the dataset, such as a specific region, object type (e.g., roads), or a predefined Level of Detail (LoD). The CityGML file structure is hierarchical, ultimately reaching individual objects and their attributes, with geometries described using GML.  Another important CityGML implementation is 3DCityDB [11], a free, open-source, and platform-independent 3D geodatabase solution for CityGML-based models.  The 3DCityDB software package includes a database schema for spatially enhanced relational database management systems (Oracle Spatial or PostgreSQL/PostGIS), along with procedures and tools for importing, managing, analyzing, visualizing, and exporting virtual 3D city models according to the CityGML standard.\n\nHowever, the full potential of querying CityGML data remains untapped.  The official GML/XML encoding, primarily designed as an exchange format, is not optimized for query answering.  A common approach involves storing CityGML data in 3DCityDB and querying it using SQL.",
        "With the increasing prevalence of machine learning models capable of generating text that resembles human writing, concerns about potential misuse are on the rise. As the detection of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more challenging, the most practical approach to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-generated text is to intentionally embed a watermark in the LLM-generated text.\n\nA series of studies have demonstrated that it is possible to embed a watermark in LLMs by modifying the output texts. Recently, Christ, Gunn, and Zamir presented a method to embed a watermark in LLM outputs without altering the distribution of responses. They showed that with a secret key, the modified LLM outputs can be detected as watermarked, while it remains computationally infeasible to differentiate between the original and modified LLMs without the key, even with multiple queries.\n\nIn this context, we aim to extend the watermarking technique proposed by Christ, Gunn, and Zamir to embed any hidden payload into LLM responses while maintaining undetectability. This means that LLMs can encode additional information, such as user metadata or session details, in their responses without changing the quality of the text. By employing a dynamic variant of Error Correcting Codes with feedback, we are able to transform the watermarking scheme into a message embedding technique.\n\nOur approach, unlike other methods that alter the distribution of responses, allows for the recovery of hidden messages from LLM responses without knowledge of the prompt used. Our scheme can encode a linear amount of hidden bits in LLM outputs, which is shown to be asymptotically optimal under realistic assumptions. Importantly, our scheme minimally impacts the complexity of the text generation process, making it straightforward and efficient to implement.\n\nWhile we provide theoretical proofs and empirical examples to support the effectiveness of our scheme, we acknowledge that it may not be robust to edits of the generated text, which remains an open problem for future exploration.",
        "The notion that constructively defined functions and computable functions can be equated is widespread in intuitionistic logic, especially in constructive type theory where computation is fundamental. This intuition is formalized in the axiom CT (\"Church's thesis\"), which asserts that every function is computable, meaning it can be defined within a computational model. CT has been extensively studied in Russian constructivism and in the realm of constructive reverse mathematics.\n\nCT allows for proving results in recursion theory without relying heavily on specific computational models, as reasoning can be done directly with functions. While it is feasible to develop synthetic concepts in computability theory without axiomatic assumptions, adopting CT leads to stronger outcomes. Essentially, CT furnishes a universal machine for all functions within the logic, enabling the demonstration of the non-existence of certain decision-making functions whose existence is independent of any axioms.\n\nIt is evident that CT contradicts traditional classical mathematics, as the law of excluded middle (LEM) in conjunction with a variant of the axiom of countable choice (AC_N, N) permits the formulation of non-computable functions. This discrepancy can be further elucidated in various ways. For instance, to establish a non-computable function directly, the weak limited principle of omniscience (WLPO) and the axiom of countable unique choice (AUC_N, B) are sufficient. Alternatively, Kleene observed the existence of a decidable tree predicate with an infinite number of nodes but lacking a computable infinite path. When functions and computable functions are equated via CT, a Kleene tree contradicts weak K\u0151nig's lemma (WKL) and Brouwer's fan theorem.\n\nNevertheless, it is known that CT is consistent with Heyting arithmetic when coupled with Markov's principle (MP), which, under CT, asserts that computation termination remains stable under double negation.",
        "3D object detection is a critical task in computer vision and robotics, extensively studied alongside the development of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. Currently, LiDAR sensors are widely used for perception tasks due to their ability to provide accurate range measurements of the surrounding environment, particularly for detecting obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. With the advancement of deep learning techniques based on point-cloud representations, many LiDAR-based 3D object detection approaches have been developed. These approaches generally fall into two categories: point-based and voxel-based methods.\n\nWhile LiDAR sensors excel in providing distance information about obstacles, they often lose detailed geometry due to sparse scanning and cannot capture texture or color information. As a result, LiDAR-based object detection solutions frequently encounter issues with false positive detections and misclassification of categories.\n\nConversely, camera sensors offer detailed texture and color information with high resolution, although they lose depth information during the perspective projection-based imaging process. Combining LiDAR and camera sensors is a promising strategy to enhance the performance of perception systems in autonomous driving. In the literature, multi-modal object detection approaches are categorized into early fusion, deep fusion, and late fusion methods. Early fusion approaches directly combine raw data from different sensors before feeding them into the detection framework, requiring pixel-level correspondence between each sensor's data. Late fusion approaches detect objects independently using each data type and then fuse the results at the bounding box level. Deep fusion methods, on the other hand, first extract features using different deep neural networks and then fuse them at the feature level.\n\nA simple yet effective sequential fusion method, PointPainting, has achieved superior detection results on various benchmarks. This approach employs 2D image semantic segmentation results from an off-the-shelf neural network and incorporates them into a point-cloud-based 3D object detection framework through 2D-3D projection. The success of PointPainting indicates that 2D image segmentation results can be integrated into any 3D object detectors, be they point-based or voxel-based.\n\nHowever, image-based semantic segmentation methods often suffer from boundary-blurring effects due to the relatively low resolution of deep feature maps. This issue becomes more pronounced when projecting these results into a 3D point cloud. For instance, in sub-fig. 1-(a), a large frustum area of the background (e.g., points in orange) is misclassified as the foreground due to inaccurate 2D segmentation. Additionally, the correspondence between 3D points and 2D image pixels is not precisely one-to-one, due to digital quantization and many-to-one projection issues. Interestingly, segmentation from 3D point clouds, as shown in sub-fig. 1-(b), tends to perform better at defining obstacle boundaries. However, it often yields poorer category classification results compared to 2D images, which benefit from detailed texture information.\n\nPainted points, enriched with semantic information, have proven effective for object detection, even with some semantic errors. It follows intuitively that fusing 2D and 3D segmentation results could further improve detection performance. To this end, we propose a general multi-modal fusion framework, \"FusionPainting,\" to combine information from different sensors at the semantic level, thereby enhancing 3D object detection. We first utilize off-the-shelf semantic segmentors to obtain semantic information. To further boost performance, we introduce an attention module that adaptively fuses various types of semantic information at the voxel level, based on learned context features in a self-attention style. Finally, the points, now painted with fused semantic labels, are processed by 3D detectors to produce the final detection results.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows:\n1. We introduce a general multi-modal fusion framework, \"FusionPainting,\" to integrate different types of information at the semantic level, thereby improving 3D object detection performance.\n2. To enhance performance further, we propose an attention module that fuses different semantic information types at the voxel level by learning context features.\n3. Experimental results on the large-scale autonomous driving benchmark nuScenes demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion framework, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to other methods.",
        "One of the primary challenges of the boundary element method (BEM) is efficiently approximating the singular integrals that arise in boundary integral equations (BIE). A common strategy to address this issue is to superimpose known solutions onto the unknown fields to eliminate the singularities (Cruse, 1974; Liu and Rudolphi, 1999; Liu, 2000; Klaseboer et al., 2009). This technique is known as the nonsingular, regularized, or desingularized BEM. It is applied to linear elasticity (Scott et al., 2013; Taus et al., 2019), Stokes flow (Taus et al., 2016; Harmel et al., 2018), and the Helmholtz equation (Simpson et al., 2014; Peake et al., 2015), among others. Klaseboer et al. (2012) extended the nonsingular BEM to fluid mechanics, considering the Stokes equations for viscous flow, the Laplace equation for potential flow, and the Helmholtz equation for free-streamline flow.\n\nWhile the nonsingular BEM avoids the use of singular integrals and is frequently employed in recent studies, it necessitates additional integrals and the knowledge of analytical solutions, and is less efficient and more complex to implement (Khayat and Wilton, 2005).",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nWhole slide scanning has become increasingly vital in disease diagnosis and pathological research for tissue sample visualization. Unlike traditional microscope observation, this technology converts glass slides into gigapixel digital images, facilitating convenient storage and analysis. However, the high resolution of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) presents significant challenges for automated classification [15].\n\nPatch-based classification emerges as a common solution [8, 24, 3], predicting slide-level labels by first analyzing small, tiled patches within a WSI. While this approach enables the use of existing image classification models, it requires additional patch-level labeling. Such labeling by histopathology experts proves both expensive and time-consuming. Although various weakly-supervised [8, 24] and semi-supervised [5, 3] methods have been developed to generate patch-level pseudo labels more efficiently, their performance is limited by insufficient reliable supervision. Moreover, serious class-imbalance problems often arise, as tumor patches typically constitute only a small portion of the entire WSI [12].\n\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL)-based methods have gained prominence due to their requirement of only slide-level labels [18]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the typical MIL pipeline treats WSIs as bags and tiled patches as instances. The objective is to identify positive instances (such as tumor patches) within a bag, which, if present, classify the entire bag as positive. In practice, due to GPU memory constraints, a fixed ImageNet pre-trained feature extractor g(\u2022) typically converts WSI patches into feature maps. These instance features are then aggregated by a(\u2022) into a slide-level feature vector for the bag-level classifier f(\u2022) during MIL training.\n\nGiven the substantial computational demands, end-to-end training of both the feature extractor and bag classifier becomes prohibitive, particularly for high-resolution WSIs. Consequently, many methods focus solely on enhancing a(\u2022) or f(\u2022), leaving g(\u2022) untrained on the WSI dataset (Fig. 2(b)). However, the domain shift between WSI and natural images can lead to suboptimal representations.",
        "Backdoors are essentially deliberate prediction shortcuts, designed to establish a link between trigger features and target labels in models, allowing for high-confidence predictions when triggers are present. To combat this threat, defense strategies need to focus on removing these backdoor triggers either during training or testing phases. Training-time defense involves discarding trigger-affected samples to break the correlation between triggers and target labels. Test-time defenses detect and remove trigger tokens from textual input to prevent backdoor activation. However, the challenge arises when backdoor triggers are invisible or implicit, making them difficult to detect and filter out. New types of attacks, like stylistic attacks based on textual style transfer, further complicate defense strategies by using stealthy and complex triggers. In the era of large language models, the risk of malicious data pollution hidden in training data poses an unprecedented threat, necessitating effective end-to-end defenses against various backdoor attacks.\n\nRecent studies have shown that backdoor attacks on language models, such as data poisoning attacks, pose significant threats by exploiting vulnerabilities through trigger insertion in training data. These attacks can lead to critical document oversight in systems, potentially causing information leakage. Moreover, attackers can extract sensitive personal information from language models, highlighting the need for robust defense strategies in real-world scenarios. The development of efficient defense mechanisms is crucial to address the safety issues posed by backdoor attacks in diverse applications.\n\nIn response to the challenges posed by backdoor attacks, a new framework called Nested Product of Experts (NPoE) is proposed as an end-to-end defense technique against multiple backdoor triggers. NPoE builds on the PoE framework by employing an ensemble of shallow models to capture distinct backdoor triggers. This ensemble is then used to train a main model that is shielded from backdoors present in poisoned training data.",
        "More companies are embracing Information Technology (IT) in their operations. To standardize IT-related activities, the British government developed the IT Infrastructural Library (ITIL), which defines the standards and best practices across the entire IT service life cycle, including strategy, design, transition, operation, and continuous service improvement. According to ITIL, \"operation\" refers to processes crucial to the day-to-day running of companies, encompassing the direct delivery of goods and services from service providers to end users.\n\nAn incident is an event that prevents a user from performing their task, which could be due to a system fault, an access request, or a lack of user knowledge. An incident ticket is a document containing user-generated text and system information. The ticket routing problem in incident management and service operation is the focus of our study.\n\nIn the incident management workflow recommended by ITIL, a user creates an incident ticket, which is then matched with an expert group responsible for processing it. If the initial group cannot resolve the issue, the ticket is transferred to another group until it is resolved. The ticket routing problem involves assigning the ticket to an initial expert group for processing and transferring it to another group if necessary.\n\nPrevious works have addressed the ticket routing problem using classification models trained on textual content and transfer histories of tickets. In our study, we propose a joint framework that considers features from both expert assignment and ticket transfer in an end-to-end model, aiming to improve incident resolution efficiency.\n\nThrough large-scale analysis on archived tickets, we discovered that tickets with shorter routing sequences tend to have higher content clarity. We also found that the probability of specific roles in ticket routing differs across expert groups, and we extracted network features to model expert groups using structure information.\n\nOur proposed Unified Framework for IT Ticket Routing (UFTR) computes a matching score for each ticket-group pair by incorporating features from ticket and group interactions. UFTR outperforms baseline models on real ticket data processing, with the listwise ranking model showing marginally better results. The Ticket-Group features were found to be the most important in our ranking model, contrary to previous findings.\n\nIn conclusion, our study contributes a comprehensive framework for IT ticket routing that enhances incident resolution efficiency and improves routing evaluation metrics.",
        "Recent research suggests that solutions to complex problems like general artificial intelligence are more likely to be found through open-ended exploration of problems and solutions rather than manual engineering of algorithmic components. This approach will necessitate divergent exploration of parameters to avoid getting stuck in deceptive minima and to encourage diversity in possible solutions. Parameter spaces often have high dimensions, with many dimensions having little correlation with the tasks at hand. Therefore, it is important to focus the search on relevant areas. Various divergent methods like Novelty Search, Surprise Search, and Curiosity Search define a behavior space as a way to guide the search, whether hand-engineered or learned. While this paper focuses on Novelty Search, the proposed method can also be applied to other search approaches.\n\nMost behavior spaces used in Novelty Search are low-dimensional, but as complexity increases, higher-dimensional descriptors will be needed. However, the traditional use of k-nearest neighbors search in high-dimensional spaces poses challenges such as ill-defined distances and increased time complexity. An inadequate archive size can lead to cycling in behavior space, hindering exploration. While Novelty Search is somewhat robust to hyperparameters, attention to their tuning is still necessary for optimal performance.\n\nThe paper introduces Behavior Recognition Novelty Search (BR-NS) as an alternative to traditional NS, eliminating the need for an archive and nearest neighbors search, making it more suitable for high-dimensional settings. Metrics and formalizations are proposed to evaluate undesirable properties that can cause novelty-based algorithms to cycle in behavior space.\n\nUnlike previous approaches that still rely on k-nearest neighbors search for novelty estimation, BR-NS leverages a mechanism inspired by intrinsic motivation and curiosity in Reinforcement Learning to search for novelty in behavior space. The subsequent sections of the paper will provide an overview of Novelty Search, detail the proposed BR-NS method, present formalizations and evaluation tools, demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of BR-NS, and offer closing discussions and remarks.",

Whether through vehicle type approval or self-certification, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) must undergo rigorous certification processes to validate a component, a system, or the entire vehicle.\n\nTraditionally, vehicles are certified using classical methods, involving physical certification tests conducted on test tracks or benches to assess the necessary safety levels based on various performance criteria. These methods are suitable for components, systems, and vehicles with limited complexity and minimal interactions with other entities, such as in braking tests. However, as system complexity increases (for example, with Electronic Stability Control), classical methods fall short in covering all relevant safety areas. This is due to two main reasons. First, the multitude of safety-related systems, including numerous electrical and electronic systems, increases the risk of systematic and random hardware failures. These issues are generally addressed by existing functional safety and Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASIL) requirements in the automotive industry, like ISO 26262. Second, the vast variability of potential multi-agent scenarios necessitates a formal safety model and has led to the adoption of simulation-based safety audits to complement physical vehicle testing.\n\nThe introduction of assisted (SAE Levels 1 and 2), automated (SAE Level 3), and autonomous (SAE Levels 4 and 5) driving systems further complicates matters, with increased software functions, multi-agent scenario variants, interactions, and potentially impacted safety areas. The complexity and testing difficulty of these systems grow with the level of automation, especially significant in the transition from SAE Level 3 to 4. Here, the automated driving system must achieve a minimal risk condition within its Operational Design Domain (ODD) without user or passenger intervention.\n\nInnovative testing approaches are required for future vehicle safety regulatory frameworks and assessments under current exemption procedures. New online and in-service safety monitoring and verification mechanisms, which come into play after the market deployment of automated driving systems, are also necessary to reduce the need for testing all possible combinations during type approval. Numerous national and international regulatory and standardization initiatives and projects are already addressing these challenges.\n\nOne of the most robust regulatory proposals is being developed by the Working Party on Automated/Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (GRVA) of the UNECE World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29). It is based on three pillars that must be assessed together. Firstly, audit and assessment involve the use of simulations to cover all types of scenarios, particularly edge cases that are rare in real-world traffic. Secondly, physical certification tests assess critical scenarios in controlled environments on test tracks, utilizing sophisticated equipment such as lightweight global vehicle targets, articulated pedestrian targets, and bicyclist targets. Finally, real-world test drives are conceived as a \"driving license test\" for automated driving systems, evaluating the vehicle's overall capabilities and behavior in non-simulated traffic on public or open roads. This approach has been adopted by the UN to regulate the approval of Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) and more recently, Automated Lane Keeping Systems (ALKS). These regulations have been integrated into countries such as Japan and Germany, facilitating the commercialization of the first SAE Level 3 automated driving systems by two different car manufacturers.\n\nA similar approach was put forward by the PEGASUS project, which included laboratory, simulation, testing site tests, and field tests, with a focus on defining use cases and test scenarios. Another project, ENABLE-S3, aimed to reduce traditional road testing efforts by emphasizing virtualization. A key contribution was the use of semi-virtual systems like the DrivingCube, which combines simulation with ready-to-drive vehicles on a chassis dynamometer and a power-train testbed. This method serves as an intermediate step between pure simulation-based verification and physical certification testing, or as a subfield of simulation using vehicle-in-the-loop (VIL).\n\nThe three approaches mentioned\u2014simulation (including VIL simulation), physical, and real-world testing\u2014have their strengths and weaknesses, making it crucial to implement them holistically. As shown in Table I, these methods are somewhat complementary. Simulation-based testing offers full controllability, repeatability, and variability efficiently but lacks fidelity and real-world behaviors. Increasing fidelity comes at the cost of increased complexity, reducing efficiency from VIL simulation to physical testing on closed tracks.",
        "Several studies about Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicles (HUAUVs) have been conducted recently [1] - [8]. These vehicles provide an interesting range of possible applications due to their capability to operate in two different environments, including inspection and mapping of partly submerged areas in industrial facilities, search and rescue, and other military-related applications. However, the state-of-the-art is yet focused on the vehicle design and structure, with even fewer studies around autonomous navigation [9]. The ability to perform tasks in both environments and successfully transition between them imposes additional challenges that must be addressed to make this mobile vehicle autonomously feasible.\n\nIn this work, we explore the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL) in the context of HUAUVs to perform navigation-related tasks, simulating environmental rescue tasks in robotics. We present two enhanced approaches based on state-of-the-art Deep-RL for continuous state scenarios: (1) a deterministic approach based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) [14], and (2) a stochastic approach based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [15]. We demonstrate that we can train agents with a consistently better capability than the state-of-the-art, performing with more stability in mapless navigation, obstacle avoidance, and medium transition. We perform a two-fold evaluation with air-to-water and water-to-air navigation, and compare our Double Critic Reinforcement Learning (DoCRL) approaches with single critic-based approaches and an adapted version of a traditional Behavior-Based Algorithm (BBA) [16] used in aerial vehicles. Our proposed double critic formulation is illustrated in Fig. 1.\n\nApproaches based on Deep-RL techniques have been enhanced to address navigation-related tasks for a range of mobile vehicles, including ground mobile robots [10], aerial robots [11], [12], and underwater robots [13]. These approaches, based on single critic actor-critic techniques with multi-layer network structures, have achieved promising results in mapless navigation, obstacle avoidance, and medium transitioning, even for HUAUVs [9]. However, the challenges faced by this kind of vehicle make these approaches limited, and they are not capable of scaling to more complex scenarios, such as rescue navigation tasks, for example.\n\nThis work contains the following main contributions:\n- We propose two approaches based on state-of-the-art, actor-critic, double critic, Deep-RL algorithms, capable of successfully performing goal-oriented, mapless navigation for HUAUVs, using only range data and the vehicles' relative localization data.",

These models, trained on extensive code repositories, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various programming tasks. Tools like ChatGPT and LLaMA have proven effective in multiple domains, from generating commit messages to resolving merge conflicts, creating tests, and facilitating method renaming.\n\nCode generation, in particular, has garnered significant attention due to its potential to reduce development costs. Various techniques have emerged to enhance LLM-based code generation, including:\n- Few-shot learning with sampling\n- Information retrieval augmentation\n- Domain-specific personalization\n- Multi-agent collaboration systems\n\n## The Rise of LLM Agents\n\nLLM agents\u2014customized instances designed for specific tasks\u2014have emerged as a particularly promising approach. Recent advances in multi-agent systems have successfully emulated development roles and workflows. Notable examples include:\n- MetaGPT's integration of standard operating procedures\n- Self-collaboration frameworks utilizing specialized \"expert\" agents\n- End-to-end development frameworks leveraging agent communication\n\n## The Process Model Gap\n\nWhile LLMs show promise in automating software engineering tasks, real-world software development remains a collaborative, multi-faceted process. Traditional software process models (Waterfall, Test-Driven Development, Scrum) have well-documented strengths and weaknesses, but their impact on LLM code generation remains unexplored.\n\n## Introducing LCG: A Novel Framework\n\nThis paper presents LCG (Large Language Model Code Generation), a multi-agent framework that integrates:\n- Advanced prompt engineering techniques\n- Emulation of real-world development processes\n- Role-specific agents (requirement engineers, architects, developers, testers, scrum masters)\n\n### Key Implementations\n- LCG Waterfall\n- LCG TDD\n- LCG Scrum\n\n## Evaluation Results\n\nOur comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks (HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, MBPP-ET) reveals:\n- LCG Scrum achieves superior accuracy (Pass@1 scores ranging from 56.7 to 82.5)\n- Significant improvements over baseline GPT performance (5.2% to 31.5% increase)\n- Enhanced stability with minimal standard deviation (average 1.3%)\n\n## Key Findings\n\n1.

        "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the state-of-the-art approach to molecular property prediction (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Gilmer et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). A GNN operates on a molecule's graph structure in two phases: a message passing phase, where a molecular representation is learned by exchanging messages between atom or bond states, and a readout phase, where a feed forward network (FFN) converts this representation into a prediction.\n\nThe specific challenges of molecular property prediction align well with the potential advantages of Bayesian learning.  In cheminformatics, generalization is hampered by the concept of a molecular scaffold \u2013 the core structure to which functional groups attach. Highly parameterized GNNs are prone to overfitting to training scaffolds, resulting in a poor molecular representation and hindering generalization to test data (Yang et al., 2019).  Furthermore, models risk producing overconfident predictions on new scaffolds, masking the uncertainty inherent in exploring new chemical spaces. This poorly quantified uncertainty makes it difficult to evaluate model robustness and applicability to out-of-domain data (Hirschfeld et al., 2020).  We believe Bayesian modeling offers the best solution to these challenges. Unlike classical neural networks that commit to a single hypothesis, a Bayesian approach constructs a predictive distribution by considering all possible parameter settings.  Bayesian marginalization can improve both the calibration (Maddox et al., 2019) and accuracy (Izmailov et al., 2019) of deep neural networks trained on limited data.\n\n\nRelated work has explored these issues.  Hirschfeld et al. (2020) benchmarked uncertainty quantification methods for molecular property prediction using the same GNN architecture we employ. While they found no consistently superior method, replacing the readout phase with a Gaussian process (GP) or random forest yielded reasonable performance.",
        "Historical archives and libraries house a diverse array of document sources that capture the memory of the past. Recognizing scanned images of these documents enables the reconstruction of history. A significant subset of archival data comprises historical photographs, brimming with evidence that narrates a snapshot of a bygone era. By keenly observing subtle cues present in various objects within the scene\u2014such as clothing, hairstyles, surroundings, tools, machinery, and natural landscapes\u2014one can glean important insights to estimate the photograph's creation date. Furthermore, texture and color features can also aid in accurately determining the image's age, as photographic techniques have evolved over time, leaving distinct date imprints.\n\nEstimating the creation date of cultural heritage photographic assets is a complex endeavor typically undertaken by experts, like archivists or genealogists, who leverage their specialized knowledge of these visual clues to provide precise date assessments for undated photographs. However, manual analysis is labor-intensive and costly, prompting a growing interest in automated image date estimation models to streamline large-scale archival processing with minimal human intervention.\n\nTraditionally, date estimation methods for historical images revolve around direct computation through classification or regression. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach for estimating the date of historical photographs within a retrieval framework. This method incorporates the date estimation of photographs into the ranked search results for a given query image, offering a contextualized prediction based on the other images in the collection. Even in cases where the exact date remains elusive, users can derive valuable insights from the relative ordering of photographs, aiding in annotating document sources within archives.\n\nOur proposed model for historical photograph retrieval hinges on a novel ranking loss function, smooth-nDCG, grounded in the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain ranking metric. This approach enables the training of our system based on known relevance feedback, such as the distance in years between images.\n\nCentral to our methodology is optimizing rankings to elevate images with dates closer to the query image, resulting in higher ranks. When presented with an unknown image as a query, the method calculates distances to a support dataset comprising images with known dates. By assuming that highly ranked images share the same date, the system estimates the date of the query image.\n\nUnlike existing literature, our method not only predicts but also ranks images based on a query. By prioritizing images in chronological order relative to the query, our system can retrieve a list of images sorted by temporal proximity, which holds relevance for diverse applications and systems reliant on sifting through vast datasets.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into the pertinent state-of-the-art literature.",

        "In 1992, Neal Stephenson introduced the term \"metaverse\" for the first time in his book \"Snow Crash.\" He described the Metaverse as a vast virtual environment where objects are interlinked with the real world and people interact with them via digital avatars. Since its introduction, the Metaverse as a virtual universe has been associated with various concepts, including life-logging technologies, spatial internet, embodied internet, collective virtual space, and a mirror world of simulation and collaboration. Mark Zuckerberg, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), announced Facebook's rebranding as Meta in October 2021, sparking discussions across diverse communities such as academia, enterprise market stakeholders, industry workers, and experts.\n\nApart from Meta, several IT sectors have shown keen interest in this concept and are investing in developing a Metaverse. For instance, Microsoft recently acquired the video game holding company Activision Blizzard as part of a move to expand virtual gaming and online technology into the Metaverse.\n\nWith the rapid growth of the Metaverse, it is anticipated that this technology will become a game-changer, attracting major stakeholders such as Internet finance companies, online gaming companies, social networks, and other leading technologies. The Seoul local government in South Korea recently unveiled a Metaverse plan aimed at creating a virtual communication paradigm for various municipal administrative areas, including culture, economy, tourism, civic services, and educational activities.\n\nMoreover, a report by Bloomberg Intelligence in 2020 predicts that Metaverse revenue will increase from USD $500 billion to USD $800 billion by 2024, with a significant portion coming from the online game industry. Traditional video game companies are planning to transition from their current gaming frameworks to a three-dimensional (3D) virtual world in conjunction with social networks. Additionally, new activities such as live entertainment, live gaming, media advertising, and other events are expected to further boost the adoption of Metaverse technology in the future.\n\nWhile the potential of Metaverse technology in various sectors is promising, its inherent reliance on extensive connectivity and communication poses security risks that could impact stakeholders. Hence, ensuring the security of Metaverse technology is crucial and requires the expertise of network engineers, research community stakeholders, and security experts to build trust among clients and enterprise market users.\n\nTo delve deeper into the future applications, applicability, and expandability of Metaverse technology, this paper presents a systematic survey addressing the security concerns associated with Metaverse applications. The paper begins by discussing the taxonomy and different applications of Metaverse technology, followed by an exploration of security threats and challenges, along with future research directions.\n\nThe key contributions of this systematic review are summarized as follows:\n1. An overview of the taxonomy and current applications of Metaverse technology, including a discussion on future domains and the relevance of 5G/6G technology to Metaverse operational capabilities.\n2. A review of existing literature related to Metaverse technology security concerns, highlighting the need for comprehensive survey papers in this area.\n3.",
        "Modern AI development relies on a pipeline that involves pre-training general-purpose models using vast amounts of data and subsequently adapting them to specific tasks. In natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), this adaptation typically occurs within a single modality, focusing on different tasks or domains. However, recent research has begun exploring the use of pre-trained models across different modalities. Examples of this work include the Frozen Pretrained Transformers (FPT) by Lu et al. (2021), ORCA by Shen et al. (2023), OmniPred by Song et al. (2024), and the Unified PDE Solver (UPS) by Shen et al. (2024).\n\nORCA represents a recent advancement in crossmodal fine-tuning, as discussed by Shen et al. (2023). The process involves a three-phase pipeline. Initially, a pre-trained transformer is selected, and a custom embedder along with a predictor is developed to accommodate any combination of input-output dimensions. Next, the embedder is trained to minimize the distance between a target and a proxy dataset, facilitating the mapping of the target dataset into the embedding space of the pre-trained model. Finally, all three components\u2014pre-trained transformer, embedder, and predictor\u2014are fine-tuned using data from the target task. According to Shen et al., the key to ORCA's success lies in the custom embedder's training.\n\nTo better understand the contributions of ORCA's individual components, we expand on the ablations performed by Shen et al. Our research specifically focuses on dissecting the second and third stages of the ORCA pipeline. Our primary research questions are as follows:\n1. How does the choice of proxy dataset affect performance? (See \u00a73)\n2.",
        "This paper explores the separation of blind source nonstationary signals, where a nonstationary signal is expressed as a combination of Fourier-like oscillatory modes:\n\nEQUATION\n\nwith \\( A_k(t) \\), \\( \\phi_k(t) > 0 \\), and \\( A_k(t) \\) varying slowly. This form of representation, known as an adaptive harmonic model (AHM), is crucial for extracting information, such as the underlying dynamics embedded within the nonstationary signal. This involves using the trend \\( A_0(t) \\), instantaneous amplitudes (IAs) \\( A_k(t) \\), and instantaneous frequencies (IFs) \\( \\phi_k(t) \\) to describe the underlying dynamics.\n\nMany real-world phenomena in nature, which can be formulated as signals or time series, often appear as time-overlapping multicomponent signals as described in equation (1). A common approach to understand and process such phenomena is decomposing, or better, separating these multicomponent signals into their basic building blocks \\( x_k(t) \\) (referred to as components, modes, or sub-signals) to extract the necessary features. In applications such as radar and communications, signals often appear in multicomponent modes. Given that these signals are primarily nonstationary\u2014meaning their amplitudes and/or phases change over time\u2014few effective rigorous methods for their decomposition are available.\n\nThe empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm, in conjunction with Hilbert spectrum analysis (HSA), is a popular method for decomposing and analyzing nonstationary signals. EMD functions as a filter bank to decompose a nonstationary signal into a superposition of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a trend, after which the IF of each IMF is calculated by HSA. Numerous articles study the properties of EMD, and variants have been proposed to enhance its performance. For instance, EMD's separation capability was discussed, demonstrating its limitations in decomposing two components with closely spaced frequencies. The ensemble EMD (EEMD) was introduced to suppress noise interferences. Extensions of the original EMD to multivariate signals and alternative sifting algorithms have also been proposed. Similar to EMD's filter bank, the empirical wavelet transform serves as another decomposition method.",
        "Public opinion has been shown to be significantly influenced by framing effects. Framing refers to the presentation of an issue, where even small changes may have outsized effects on beliefs. For example, when asked about \"welfare,\" the American public is largely against increasing spending (with only 20% in favor), but when asked about \"assistance to the poor,\" 65% believe that the government is not spending enough.\n\nWhile other research has focused on syntactic framing or issue framing, we focus specifically on lexical framing, distinguishing sentences by their connotative meaning even where they have the same denotative meaning. According to Frege, two sentences with the same truth conditions may refer to the same entities or state of affairs (\"reference,\" also known as denotation) but be presented differently.\n\nAlabama's Supreme Court Chief Justice was suspended for ordering state probate judges not to grant marriage licenses to gay couples.",
        "The laws of quantum mechanics govern the behavior of matter at the microscopic level, forming the foundation of chemistry, condensed matter physics, and material science.  While these laws have been understood for nearly a century [45], their fundamental equations are computationally intractable for complex systems, limiting analytical solutions to the simplest cases.  Recent advances in deep learning, however, have offered powerful tools for improving computational quantum physics [7], particularly within the realm of chemistry, where the quantum behavior of electrons is paramount.  Deep neural networks were first applied to compute the quantum behavior of molecules almost concurrently by several groups [10, 25, 43], leading to a flurry of subsequent refinements and extensions [26].  However, this follow-up work has primarily focused on application-specific improvements and iterative modifications to the original neural network architectures.\n\nSimultaneously, self-attention neural networks, exemplified by the Transformer [55], have revolutionized machine learning, driving breakthroughs in diverse fields such as natural language processing [13], language modeling [6], image recognition [14], and protein folding [29].  The permutation equivariance of the basic self-attention layer, where outputs are invariant to the input order, is particularly advantageous for chemical applications where physical quantities should remain unaffected by the ordering of atoms and electrons [18].  Despite these successes, the potential of self-attention neural networks for approximating solutions in computational quantum mechanics remains unexplored.\n\nThis work introduces the Wavefunction Transformer (Psiformer), a novel self-attention neural network designed as an approximate numerical solution (or Ansatz) for the fundamental equations governing the quantum mechanics of electrons.* We benchmark the Psiformer on a diverse range of atomic and molecular systems, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy compared to existing neural network Ansatzes of comparable size. This accuracy advantage becomes increasingly pronounced with larger systems, reaching up to 75 times the typical \"chemical accuracy\" standard.",
        "In LAPACK, the routines `S/D/CS/ZD`RSCL scale a complex vector *x* by the reciprocal of a real number *a*.  This is functionally equivalent to the following code:\n\n```\ndo i = 1, n\n  x(i) = x(i) / a\nend do\n```\n\nHowever, the RSCL routines incorporate two key optimizations:\n\n1. They leverage the BLAS routine SCAL to perform the scaling by the reciprocal of *a*. This utilizes only one division and *n* multiplications, compared to the *n* divisions in the code snippet above.\n\n2. The operation (1/*a*) * *x*<sub>i</sub> can overflow or underflow in finite precision, even when *x*<sub>i</sub> / *a* does not.  Therefore, the RSCL routines also check the range of *a* and, if necessary, scale *x* by a power of two. This may incur an additional *n* multiplications by a power of two, depending on the value of *a*.\n\nConsequently, the RSCL routines are generally faster than the naive code. However, the simpler code is often more accurate due to its reduced number of floating-point operations.  This performance gain is particularly pronounced when *x* is complex, as complex division is more computationally expensive than complex multiplication (except in the trivial case where the denominator has a zero real or imaginary part).  Furthermore, the accuracy loss in the complex case can be negligible, because computing a complex division inherently involves a complex multiplication of the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator.\n\nSome LAPACK routines, such as CLARFG and CGETF2, require reciprocal scaling where both *a* and *x* are complex.",

        "Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) have been proposed in the literature (Kiess and Mauve 2007, Reina et al. 2015, Mohammed and Al-Ghrairi 2019) as a communication technology for emergencies and disasters.  Cellular-based infrastructures may become unavailable due to significant damage in such situations.  MANETs, however, can be rapidly deployed without fixed infrastructure, setup, or prior requirements. This flexibility is particularly attractive when communication between victims and rescue teams is crucial.  A key challenge in MANET implementation is demonstrating sufficient reliability compared to other approaches (Kiess and Mauve 2007).  Real-world verification and validation (V&V) under emergency conditions is virtually impossible, making simulation a vital tool in MANET research.\n\nSimulators offer a cost-effective way to evaluate the performance and accuracy of algorithms and systems without requiring actual hardware. They also enable the assessment of network capacity under extreme conditions by virtually varying parameters and exploring different scenarios (Manpreet and Malhotra 2014).  However, despite increased development and usage, the credibility of simulator results has declined over time (Kurkowski et al. 2005, Hogie et al. 2006).  Some of the challenges encountered in MANET development (arXiv:2004.14093v1 [cs.DC] 29 Apr 2020) are inherent to simulation in general: repeatability, consistency, and model accuracy (Sargent 2001).  Simulators often focus on specific aspects of the network structure itself, neglecting the complexity and heterogeneity of the systems that rely on it, such as autonomous vehicles, unmanned aircraft systems, and communication software.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a real-world example of a MANET-based ecosystem in an emergency. Collaborative drones operating in a complex environment must communicate without fixed infrastructure, transmitting data to rescue teams equipped with mobile devices running real-time 3D processing software. This allows professionals to assess the situation.  The data should also be stored in an internet-connected database to enable informed decision-making by management teams.  Decision support can be further enhanced through AI-driven decision-making processes (Phillips-Wren and Jain 2006).  Ideally, verification and simulation of the entire ecosystem should consider all aspects and characteristics of the various devices and disaster scenarios. While fully achieving this is impossible, abstraction is a recognized challenge, particularly in MANET simulation (Hogie et al.",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising path toward creating versatile and adept artificial agents. By learning from interactions, these agents can develop robust control strategies capable of handling real-world complexities that are challenging to engineer accurately. However, tasks like object manipulation present significant challenges for RL. Although remarkable outcomes have been achieved through methods like simulation-to-real transfer [1] and extensive physical parallelization [2], training typically demands countless hours of interaction. Therefore, enhancing sample efficiency is a crucial concern in RL. This paper addresses this issue from a causal inference perspective.\n\nWhen can an agent be considered in control of its environment? An agent can influence its environment only through its actions. While this may seem obvious, it is often overlooked that the causal influence of actions is situation-dependent. Consider a simple scenario: a robotic arm in front of an object on a table. The object can only be moved when contact is made between the robot and the object. Generally, there are situations where immediate causal influence is possible and others where it is not. In this work, we formalize this situation-dependent nature of control and demonstrate how it can be leveraged to enhance the sample efficiency of RL agents. To achieve this, we derive a measure that captures the causal influence of actions on the environment and develop a practical method to compute it.\n\nUnderstanding when the agent has control over an object of interest is crucial from both a learning and an exploration standpoint. The learning algorithm should focus on these situations because (i) the robot is initially rarely in control of the object of interest, making training inefficient, (ii) physical contacts are difficult to model and thus require more effort to learn, and (iii) these states enable manipulation toward further goals. However, for learning to occur, the algorithm first needs data that includes these relevant states. Therefore, the agent must consider its causal influence even during the exploration phase.\n\nWe propose several ways to integrate our causal influence measure into RL algorithms, addressing both the exploration and the learning aspects. For exploration, agents can be rewarded with a bonus for reaching states of causal influence. We demonstrate that such a bonus leads the agent to quickly discover useful behavior, even in the absence of task-specific rewards. Additionally, our approach allows the exploration to be explicitly guided, favoring actions with a higher predicted causal impact. This is a successful alternative to the -greedy exploration, as we demonstrate. Finally, for the learning phase, we propose an off-policy prioritization scheme, and the results show a reliable improvement in data efficiency.

However, the increasing model size and computational cost of these models pose significant challenges for on-device machine learning (ML), particularly due to the stringent performance and energy constraints of edge devices.\n\nAs the computing community reaches the limits of traditional architectural performance scaling, there has been growing interest in enabling on-device machine learning through custom DNN accelerators. These tailored accelerators have demonstrated significant improvements over CPUs and GPUs (Chen et al., 2016; Jouppi et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2017), particularly in terms of performance per area and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, machine learning practitioners have focused on model compression techniques (Han et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2018; Chin et al., 2020), while computer architects have investigated novel hardware architectures to enhance system performance and energy efficiency (Inci & Marculescu, 2018; Inci et al., 2020b; 2021b; 2020a; 2021a).\n\nTo better understand the trade-offs between various architectural design choices and DNN workloads, there is a clear need for a comprehensive design space exploration framework. Such a framework should rapidly iterate over various designs and generate power, performance, and area (PPA) results. To address this need, we present QAPPA, a quantization-aware power, performance, and area modeling framework for DNN accelerators. Our work makes the following key contributions:\n\n\u2022 QAPPA enables future research on design space exploration of DNN accelerators, considering various design parameters such as bit precision, processing element types, scratchpad size, global buffer size, device bandwidth, and total processing elements.",
        "Astrophysics, particularly solar physics, is an observational science where experimental conditions cannot be altered, only observed. Therefore, the primary method of learning is by comparing observations with advanced theoretical models. These models are refined until they explain the observations, shaping our understanding of the universe based on available data.\n\nUntil the late 20th century, the limited data could be easily stored in conventional media like notebooks or small computing centers. Researchers heavily relied on informed generative models, incorporating theoretical advancements and inductive biases to generalize conclusions. Generative models describe the joint probability p(x, y), where x represents observations and y denotes model parameters.\n\nSolar physics is now transitioning into the big data era, characterized by vast amounts of data that surpass current computing capabilities. The challenge lies in storing and accessing this data efficiently, as exemplified by the Solar Dynamics Observatory dataset requiring 6.5 TB of storage. The increase in data volume poses a technological hurdle that remains partially unresolved.\n\nAccess to large datasets in solar physics has fueled the rise of machine learning (ML) as a means to extract valuable insights efficiently. ML methods are categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each with distinct roots and applications within the field. The advent of big data spurred the ML revolution, necessitating the development of algorithms and hardware to handle large datasets effectively.\n\nSupervised and unsupervised learning in ML are deeply rooted in statistical learning, focused on model fitting and understanding data structures. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, draws from control theory and has potential applications in observational planning and adaptive optics within solar physics. Functional optimization is a common thread across all three classes of ML, contributing to advancements in the field.\n\nIn summary, the integration of machine learning in solar physics facilitates the direct extraction of insights from vast datasets, revolutionizing data analysis and accelerating scientific discoveries. The intersection of advanced theoretical modeling and machine learning is propelling the field towards a deeper comprehension of the universe's complexities.",
        "Color vision deficiency (CVD), commonly known as color blindness, is the inability or reduced capacity to differentiate between colors in regular lighting. There are more than 300 million individuals with CVD, with approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 250 women (0.5%) affected. CVD is an X-linked genetic condition that affects both eyes to varying extents across different populations. This condition hampers an individual's ability to carry out tasks in personal and professional settings.\n\nColor plays a crucial role in user interface (UI) design. While the impact of color may vary among different demographics, many applications still rely on traditional color associations, like green for 'yes' and red for 'no.' Objects of the same color adhere to the Gestalt principle of similarity, while contrasting colors can help objects stand out or define figure-ground relationships. With the expanding range of colors available on modern displays, new possibilities are emerging in color utilization, but certain color domains remain invisible to individuals with CVD.\n\nAccessibility aims to create UIs that cater to all users, ensuring unhindered interactions. UI designers can opt to support accessibility for CVD users either before or after publication. Pre-publication efforts often involve using a limited and fixed color palette, while post-production methods may include automatic color adjustments, also known as daltonization. Another approach is to incorporate support for the operating system's high contrast mode. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) offer recommendations for enhancing accessibility, primarily focusing on core functionalities. Balancing functionality and aesthetics is a significant consideration in UI design, with some designers viewing aesthetics as inversely related to functionality, while other perspectives suggest a positive correlation between the two. In the context of CVD, high contrast themes may not be a priority, potentially leading to reduced aesthetic experiences for individuals with CVD, although more research is needed to understand their perceptions of UI functionality and aesthetics.\n\nComparing UI functionality and aesthetics poses challenges, particularly when evaluating designs for individuals with CVD who cannot accurately assess the usability and aesthetics of color-reliant interfaces. To address this, we utilized physiologically-based CVD simulations and enlisted 19 non-CVD participants to evaluate the functionality and aesthetics of popular UIs through the lens of a CVD observer. While our study has limitations due to non-CVD participants' bias towards full-color references, it sheds light on common UI design pitfalls across different applications and accessibility techniques. Our key contributions include:\n\n- Gathering subjective user data from non-CVD observers on the impact of CVD simulations on functionality and aesthetics\n- Analyzing results indicating a positive relationship between functionality and aesthetics scores, along with the potential drawbacks of using the OS-enabled high contrast mode\n- Publishing the dataset and participant feedback\n\nThe subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 delves into relevant background literature, Section 3 outlines the experimental methodology, while Sections 4 and 5 present our findings for further discussion.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nMachine Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represents a powerful approach to generative modeling [9]. A GAN comprises two neural networks\u2014a generator and a discriminator\u2014that employ adversarial learning to optimize their parameters. The generator transforms random inputs from a latent space into \"artificial\" or \"fake\" samples that approximate the true distribution, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between \"natural/real\" samples and those produced by the generator. This process is formulated as a minmax optimization problem through generator and discriminator loss definitions, with training converging toward an optimal generator capable of deceiving the discriminator.\n\nHowever, GANs present significant training challenges. Their adversarial dynamics introduce convergence pathologies [5, 14], primarily because both networks are differentiable and their weights are updated using simultaneous gradient-based methods to optimize the minmax objective\u2014a process that rarely achieves equilibrium. Consequently, researchers have proposed various approaches to enhance convergence and training robustness [7, 15, 18, 20, 26].\n\nA promising direction involves distributed competitive coevolutionary algorithms (Comp-COEA). These methods optimize the GAN training's minmax objective by fostering an arms race between populations of generators and discriminators. Spatially distributed populations (cellular algorithms) effectively mitigate COEA pathologies stemming from diversity limitations [19], which parallel those observed in GAN training. Lipizzaner [1, 22], a spatial distributed Comp-COEA, arranges individuals from both populations on a spatial grid, with each cell containing a GAN. Within each cell, generators and discriminators are evaluated against all neighbors, using neighborhood communication to propagate models and maintain population diversity. Selection pressure further aids convergence in the sub-populations [2].\n\nThis study examines how neighborhood communication and selection pressure influence GAN training outcomes. Through ablation analysis of these components, we address three research questions:\n- RQ1: How do communication/isolation and selection pressure affect generator quality, measured by sample accuracy and diversity?\n- RQ2: How do these factors impact network parameter diversity?\n- RQ3: What are the computational costs of implementing migration and selection/replacement?\n\nOur key contributions include:\n1. Developing distributed Comp-COEA GAN training methods through Lipizzaner ablations\n2. Assessing communication and selection pressure effects on generative model quality\n3.",

While traditionally used in medical fields for understanding disease prognosis, it has found particular importance in analyzing histological whole-slide images (WSIs). These WSIs, produced by scanning tissue slides at millimeter scale, provide unique hierarchical views at gigapixel resolution, offering valuable insights into tissue phenotype, tumor microenvironment, and cellular morphology.\n\n## Current Challenges and Limitations\n\n### Technical Challenges\n1. WSIs present unique processing challenges due to their extremely high resolution (typically 40,000 \u00d7 40,000 pixels)\n2. Traditional methods struggle with global representation learning of such large images\n3. Current datasets are limited in scale, usually containing only around 500 patients or 1,000 slides\n\n### Methodological Limitations\n1.

        "The sun plays a crucial role on Earth by providing light and energy essential for life and influencing the planet's climate. The sun's activity can vary from quiet to disturbed states, with disturbances like intense plasma eruptions known as solar flares. These solar flares come with coronal mass ejections, solar particle events, and other phenomena that can pose risks to spacecraft technology and astronauts in space. Monitoring the sun's activity and associated space weather conditions is vital. Solar observatory imagery, such as that captured by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency's (NASA) Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), provides valuable information, with around 70,000 images of sun activity taken daily.\n\nAnalyzing and interpreting these vast amounts of data manually is challenging. Therefore, there is a need to develop automated approaches to detect and track the sun's activity for more precise space weather forecasts. Various methods, including Spectrogram, Image processing, Deep learning, Neural Network, and Machine Learning, have been proposed by researchers for classifying and detecting solar activity.\n\nFor instance, Yang et al. used a simulated Annealing Genetic (SAG) method to detect sunspots, achieving excellent segmentation results. Armstrong and Fletcher employed a deep convolutional neural network to classify solar features with high accuracy, even under resolution changes. Zhu and Lin utilized a deep learning technique to accurately identify solar filaments while minimizing noise effects. Love et al. developed a convolutional neural network to classify different solar observations with 94% accuracy, and Sarsembayeva et al. used image processing techniques to detect active regions on the sun effectively.\n\nIn this study, we introduce a novel approach to tracking sun activity by transforming solar observatory images into 1-Dimensional Time Series (1-DTS). This method captures precise information regarding solar activity, particularly in storm areas with strong magnetic fields and plasma twisting. We developed two approaches using 2D circular kernel time series transformation and statistical tools with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to classify areas with strong activity, termed as solar storm.\n\nThe main contributions of this study include transforming solar observatory images into one-dimensional time series, automating sun activity tracking through statistical and entropy measures and ML approaches, and achieving high classification accuracy using the 5th percentile (X5P) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVDEn).\n\nOverall, this study aims to enhance our understanding of solar activity by developing innovative approaches to analyze solar observatory images, paving the way for more accurate space weather predictions.",
        "In recent years, the advancement of foundation models has paved the way for significant improvements in semi- and unsupervised learning methods. These improvements enable a shift from traditional end-to-end training towards decision-making over the foundation models' latent spaces (Oquab et al., 2023; Angelov et al., 2023). \n\nA key application area of these methods is the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) (Saenko et al., 2010). In UDA, we consider a source image dataset \\( S = \\{I^S_1, \\ldots, I^S_n\\} \\) and a target dataset \\( T = \\{I^T_1, \\ldots, I^T_m\\} \\). These datasets share the same set of classes \\(\\{C_1, \\ldots, C_k\\}\\), but the training labels are only available for the source dataset. The challenge, then, is to adapt a classifier, trained on the source dataset, to the target dataset, without access to the target data labels, for the purpose of classification.\n\nMost existing works targeting UDA focus on a representation learning approach, which aims to assimilate, in the feature space, the source, and the target data (Saenko et al., 2010).",
        "Deep learning features, extracted using deep neural networks trained on extensive datasets [1], differ significantly from handcrafted features like HOG [2] and SIFT [3].  The success of deep learning in computer vision and improved network infrastructure have fueled a growing interest in deep learning feature compression within the Analysis-then-Compress (ATC) paradigm [4].  ATC allows for direct feature extraction at the front-end, transmitting compact feature representations instead of raw video data, contrasting with the Compress-then-Analysis (CTA) paradigm, where videos are compressed before transmission to the cloud for analysis. This advantage has led to widespread research on ATC with both handcrafted and deep learning features to address the challenges of video big data.\n\nNumerous algorithms exist for compact feature representation.  Hash-based models like DBH [5] and vector quantization methods such as PQ [6] and OPQ [7] target compact representation of handcrafted features.  Binary descriptors like BRIEF [8] and USB [9] enable efficient Hamming distance computation.  For deep learning features, approaches include applying video coding principles [10], combining supervised learning with hash compression (DHN) [11], and intermediate deep feature compression [12].\n\nThe promise of ATC has driven standardization efforts for compact feature representation.  MPEG's CDVS and CDVA standards define standardized bitstream syntax for interoperability in image/video retrieval.  The ongoing MPEG VCM standardization effort [13, 14] aims for accurate, low-latency, object-oriented analysis based on compact video representation for machine vision. VCM builds upon feature compression advancements and connects compact feature representation with video compression for both machine vision and human perception, as features can be used in diverse machine vision tasks.\n\nInspired by recent advances in deep learning-based video coding [15], this work proposes further compressing raw deep learning features using deep neural networks.  Our contributions are threefold:\n\n* We introduce an end-to-end coding scheme for compactly representing deep learning features as a latent code, pursuing optimal feature-in-feature representation via rate-distortion optimization.\n* We propose a compact feature enhancement method, improving feasibility in feature coding.  This method employs a teacher-student enhancement module at the latent code level, enabling adaptive switching between complex decoding and high bit rate representation.\n* We implement this framework using facial features and demonstrate superior rate-accuracy performance compared to popular feature compression schemes.",

Recent studies on self-supervised training [2, 3, 4, 5] utilizing unpaired speech and text data have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional unsupervised approaches. While much of the research in self-supervised ASR focuses on creating differentiable and trainable integrations of ASR and TTS [6], some approaches treat these systems separately, using TTS for speech synthesis [7, 8, 9] and leveraging the generated data for ASR improvement through augmentation.\n\nSeveral innovative approaches have emerged in this field. Some researchers [10] enhance ASR performance by employing language models for hypothesis scoring and applying self-training techniques to refined pseudo-labels. Others [11] implement self-supervision through BERT-based pre-training to boost ASR performance with unpaired data. BERT has also proven effective as a pre-training mechanism using contrastive loss in self-supervised settings [12].\n\nA notable recent advancement in semi-supervised sequence-to-sequence ASR [13] demonstrates the effectiveness of consistency training with unlabeled speech data. Our previous work, ASR-TTS [4], implemented cycle-consistency training using REINFORCE, achieving improvements on standard speech datasets. However, subsequent experiments revealed limitations in out-of-domain scenarios, indicating room for improvement in both training methodology and architectural design.\n\nThis study explores methods to enhance the robustness of cycle-consistency approaches, particularly in limited data and out-of-domain contexts. Our key contributions include:\n\n- Integration of a pre-trained RNNLM regularization term in the ASR REINFORCE loss for speech-only (SO) training, improving resilience to poor latent ASR hypotheses\n- Introduction of a text-only (TO) training hyper-parameter that modulates ASR encoder influence by scaling attention-encoded context, enabling dynamic adjustment between acoustic and language model behavior\n- Implementation of advanced training strategies including data augmentation and annealing, alongside a Transformer-based TTS module for improved robustness and memory efficiency\n- Incorporation of multi-head attention in ASR encoder layers to achieve better performance with reduced model complexity",
        "The text discusses the advancements and challenges in the field of deep neural network (DNN) compression, particularly in relation to the rate-distortion function, which is a fundamental measure of lossy compression efficiency. Here's a restructured version of the text to enhance its logical flow and coherence:\n\n---\n\nDriven by advances in deep neural network (DNN) compression schemes, rapid progress has been made in developing high-performing lossy compression schemes for large, high-dimensional datasets that remain practical [1]-[4]. These methods have empirically outperformed classical compression schemes for real-world data, such as images. However, it remains unknown how well they perform in comparison to the fundamental limit, which is the rate-distortion function. The rate-distortion function, a measure of the asymptotic limit on the minimum number of bits required to achieve a certain distortion, is defined as R(D) := inf EQUATION, where any rate-distortion pair (R, D) satisfying R > R(D) is achievable, and no code can achieve a rate-distortion less than R(D) [16]-[18].\n\nOne approach to investigate the performance of DNN compression schemes is to examine a stylized data source, like the sawbridge random process, with a known, analytically tractable probability distribution, as done in [5]. This allows for a closed-form solution of the rate-distortion function, enabling a comparison with the empirically achievable rate and distortion of DNN compressors trained on the data source's realizations. However, this approach, while insightful, does not evaluate DNN compressors on the true, complex, and high-dimensional sources of interest, such as real-world images, for which architectural choices, such as convolutional layers, have been specifically engineered [6].",
        "Let me help restructure this text to improve its flow and coherence. Here's the reorganized version:\n\n---\n\nReinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive and promising results in robotics, from manipulation to unmanned vehicle navigation and drone flight [1-4], thanks to its ability to handle intricate models and adapt to diverse problem scenarios. However, ensuring safe control policies is crucial for real-world robot applications, as dangerous behaviors can cause irreparable damage or costly losses. This has led to significant interest and progress in RL methods that provide safety guarantees for robot control [5-10].\n\nRecent approaches to safe RL can be categorized into two main directions:\n\n1. **CMDP-Based Methods**: These focus on designing novel RL algorithms, such as actor-critic, for constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). They encourage safety constraint satisfaction either by adding constant penalties to the objective function [6] or by constructing safety critics for multi-objective policy optimization [5,7,11,12]. While these approaches are attractive for their generality and simplicity, they either require explicit models [6] or only provide probabilistic safety guarantees.\n\n2. **Certificate-Based Methods**: These approaches focus on reachability and safety guarantees through control Lyapunov functions (CLF) and control barrier functions (CBF) [8-18]. They typically implement safe controllers by adding safety filters to reference controllers, such as RL controllers [8,10,13] or model predictive control (MPC) controllers [14]. However, these methods face two key challenges:\n   - Potential conflicts between separate CLF and CBF certificates [19,20]\n   - Difficulty in finding suitable CLFs and CBFs, especially for nonlinear systems [19,21]\n\nIn this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a data-based reachability and safety theorem that doesn't require explicit knowledge of system dynamics.

        "Serial manipulators are well-established for handling tasks in automation and production.  However, their workspace and payload are limited for large-scale applications. Cable-driven parallel robots (cable robots) overcome these limitations by using cables instead of rigid prismatic actuators to control an end-effector.  Cables, due to their flexibility and low weight, can be compactly stored on drums, enabling high maximum actuation lengths and accelerations, and thus, large workspaces. A prime example is the FAST telescope [7], a spherical radio telescope with a 600m span and a ~30-ton payload. Other applications include the Robotic Seabed Cleaning Platform (RSCP) [2] for marine litter removal and high-rack warehouse solutions [4].\n\nEfficient operation is crucial for robotic handling tasks.  Loading and unloading require high accuracy, while inter-operational movements prioritize low energy consumption over precision. For cable robots, increased platform stiffness improves accuracy but also increases energy consumption due to higher cable forces [8]. Conversely, decreased stiffness lowers energy consumption but reduces accuracy. High cable forces necessitate high motor torques and currents, resulting in high energy consumption, while low cable forces lead to lower consumption.\n\nCable robots are redundant mechanisms with *m* actuated cables, where *m* \u2265 *n* + 1, and *n* represents the platform's degrees of freedom (DOFs).  Verhoeven [16] highlighted the potential of cable robots to adjust platform stiffness by modulating cable preload via the nullspace.  Kraus et al. [6] presented an energy-efficient force distribution method using a gradient vector to compute a reference force and subsequently solving the static equation via the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. This method demonstrated lower energy consumption compared to serial kinematics with a similar operating range. However, it did not address disturbances from handling tasks (e.g., loading/unloading) or platform pose errors.  Fabritius et al. [1] introduced a nullspace-based cable force correction method to maintain predefined force limits and compensate for disturbances within the cable actuation system.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, with improved readability, coherence, and flow while maintaining the core content:\n\n# Semantic Genetic Programming with Dynamic Targets: A Novel Approach to Symbolic Regression\n\nRecent research has demonstrated the successful application of Semantic methods to Genetic Programming (SGP) across various domains, yielding promising results [1, 2, 3]. While traditional GP operators (selection, crossover, and mutation) operate at the syntactic level without considering the semantic behavior of individuals (programs), SGP's key innovation lies in its application of semantic evaluations [1]. Traditional GP operators focus solely on improving individual fitness, disregarding behavioral characteristics of offspring. In contrast, SGP incorporates semantic awareness during evolution, potentially enhancing genetic programming's effectiveness [1].\n\nIn this study, we focus on the Symbolic Regression domain, working with training cases comprising m pairs of inputs and desired outputs. Following established SGP approaches [1], we define \"semantics\" as the set of output values a program produces on the training cases [4]. This approach provides richer evolutionary feedback by evaluating individuals against training cases. Formally, an individual I's semantics is represented by the vector sem(I) = y\u2081, y\u2082, ..., y_m, corresponding to responses for m training inputs. The target semantic vector is denoted as sem(\u0177) = \u0177\u2081, \u0177\u2082, ..., \u0177_m, where these values represent desired outputs. SGP establishes a semantic space [1] with metrics to measure distances between individual semantic vectors sem(I) and the target sem(\u0177). This distance often determines fitness scores, creating a unimodal fitness landscape that inherently avoids local optima [5].\n\nSGP's effectiveness depends on operators capable of navigating the semantic space toward the global optimum. Moraglio et al. [5] proposed geometric crossover as one such operator, producing offspring whose semantic vector lies between its parents in semantic space. While this guarantees offspring perform no worse than their worst parent [5], it introduces a significant drawback: exponentially increasing individual size (exponential bloat) [5, 1].",
        "Each time a cell senses changes in its environment, it orchestrates a complex choreography of molecular interactions to trigger an appropriate response. However, when a virus infects the cell, this delicate balance is disrupted, potentially leading to a cascade of systemic failures that result in disease. Specifically, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, exhibits a complex etiology that differs in subtle and substantial ways from previously studied viruses. To accurately assess the risk posed by a new pathogen, it is crucial to swiftly predict the determinants of pathogenesis and identify potential targets for medical interventions. Current approaches to this challenge include data-driven models in systems biology, which link biomolecular expression to pathogenicity, but are limited to establishing associations in the data, rather than inferring causality. Alternatively, hypothesis-driven mathematical models, which aim to capture causal relations, face obstacles such as parameter identifiability and predictive power limitations.\n\nWe posit that counterfactual inference can bridge the gap between data-driven and hypothesis-driven methodologies, allowing for the exploration of scenarios such as, \"Had we known the patient's eventual outcome, how might our actions have differed?\" Central to counterfactual inference is the structural causal model (SCM), a formalism that encodes prior domain knowledge in causal diagrams, imposes a probability distribution on exogenous variables, and assigns a deterministic function to endogenous variables.

        "Combinatorial optimization (CO) is a multidisciplinary field encompassing optimization, operations research, discrete mathematics, and computer science, with numerous critical real-world applications, such as vehicle routing and scheduling. For a comprehensive overview, refer to Korte and Vygen (2012). Mixed-integer programming technology provides a flexible framework for formulating and solving CO problems, utilizing combinatorial solvers based on tree search algorithms like branch and cut. For more details, see Nemhauser and Wolsey (1988), Schrijver (1999), and Bertsimas and Weismantel (2005). These algorithms can find certifiably optimal solutions to NP-hard problems given sufficient time. However, many key decisions during the search process, such as node and variable selection, rely on heuristics (Lodi 2013). The design of these heuristics is often based on intuition and empirical evidence, overlooking the practical reality that problem instances frequently share patterns and characteristics. Machine learning approaches have emerged to address this limitation by enhancing state-of-the-art solvers with data-driven insights (Bengio, Lodi, and Prouvost 2021; Cappart et al. 2021; Kotary et al. 2021).\n\nMany CO problems can naturally be represented using graphs, either directly (e.g., routing on road networks) or by encoding variable-constraint interactions (such as those of a MILP model) as a bipartite graph. Consequently, machine learning techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently helped bridge the gap between machine learning, relational inputs, and combinatorial optimization (Cappart et al. 2021). GNNs compute vector representations of each node in the input graph in a permutation-equivariant manner by iteratively aggregating features from neighboring nodes. By parameterizing this aggregation step, a GNN can be trained end-to-end against a loss function to adapt to the given data distribution.",
        "## Restructured Text for Improved Flow and Coherence\n\nRemote sensing technology plays a vital role in monitoring and understanding the dynamic interplay between human activities and the Earth's ecosystems.  By providing large-scale, long-term, and periodic observations of the Earth's surface, it enables the study of ecosystem changes and their societal impacts (Coppin et al., 2004).  Detecting land-cover changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images, acquired by spaceborne and airborne platforms, has become a central focus in the field (Tewkesbury et al., 2015; Zhu, 2017).\n\nNumerous change detection approaches have been developed, reflecting the technology's long history.  Traditional methods, predating deep learning, can be broadly categorized into four types: image algebra, image transformation, post-classification comparison, and other advanced methods. Image algebra methods, such as change vector analysis (CVA) (Bovolo and Bruzzone, 2007; Bruzzone and Diego Fern\u00e0ndez Prieto, 2000; Du et al., 2020), directly compare spectral bands of bitemporal images to measure change intensity. Image transformation methods, including multivariate alteration detection (MAD) (Nielsen et al., 1998), principal component analysis (PCA) (Celik, 2009; Deng et al., 2008), slow feature analysis (SFA) (Wu et al., 2014), and Fourier transform (Chen et al., 2023), transform raw image features into a new feature space to highlight change-relevant information. Post-classification comparison methods involve classifying images from different times and then comparing the resulting classification maps (Xian et al., 2009). Other advanced methods leverage machine learning models like support vector machines (Bovolo et al., 2008), conditional random fields (Hoberg et al., 2015), Markov random fields (Kasetkasem and Varshney, 2002), and object-based image analysis (OBIA) (Gil-Yepes et al., 2016; Hussain et al., 2013).\n\nThe advent of deep learning has revolutionized change detection, offering improved efficiency and accuracy in analyzing multi-temporal imagery (Shi et al., 2020).  These methods can be categorized as supervised or unsupervised, depending on the use of annotated data. Unsupervised deep learning methods typically focus on extracting spatial-spectral features from multi-temporal images and then calculating change intensity. Examples include using deep belief networks (DBN) (Zhang et al., 2016a), autoencoders (Bergamasco et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016b), deep CVA (DCVA) (Saha et al., 2019), and various specialized neural network architectures (Liu et al., 2020, 2022; Wu et al., 2022).  Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been employed to capture nonlocal dependencies in multi-temporal images (Chen et al., 2022c; Tang et al., 2022; Kipf and Welling, 2016). However, unsupervised methods face limitations due to the lack of training labels, potentially leading to suboptimal feature extraction and hindering the use of complex architectures.  Their practical application is often restricted to smaller study areas.\n\nSupervised deep learning methods, on the other hand, leverage annotated data to train change detectors, resulting in higher accuracy.  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are dominant in this category.",
        "The fastest-growing mode in urban mobility is on-demand mobility, primarily facilitated by transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft. Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) systems offer a significant advantage over private vehicles by reducing fleet size and, consequently, the need for parking spaces. This reduction is achieved through carsharing, allowing a single vehicle to serve multiple travel requests in a day. Moreover, some MoD options, such as Uber Pool, enable users to share rides, which reduces the total distance driven compared to traveling separately.\n\nA crucial challenge in MoD systems is determining the minimal vehicle fleet required to serve all travel requests, known as the fleet sizing problem. By minimizing the fleet size, the system can significantly decrease its capital costs by reducing the number of vehicles and the space needed for parking. Furthermore, operational costs can be lowered by reducing the number of drivers required.\n\nAnother significant issue in MoD systems is vehicle dispatching, which involves assigning vehicles to requests and determining the vehicles' routes. This problem is particularly complex when ridesharing is involved, as the number of possible routes increases exponentially with the number of requests. In the field of operational research, this is known as the dial-a-ride problem (DARP). By offering high-quality vehicle dispatching solutions, the system can cut operational costs by minimizing the total distance driven by the vehicles. Additionally, sharing rides can further reduce the necessary fleet size, providing all the previously mentioned benefits.\n\nIn the context of MoD, there is often a need to connect vehicle plans into longer schedules. For instance, a vehicle plan that starts at 7:00 and ends at 8:00 can be connected to another plan starting at 8:30 and ending at 9:00, creating a continuous plan from 7:00 to 9:00.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow:\n\n**Introduction and Background**\nIn kinematics, robotics, and mechanism science, Hamiltonian quaternions and dual quaternions have been employed to parametrize the group of Euclidean displacements SE(3) as well as its subgroups SO(3) and SE(2). The rich algebraic structure of the quaternion models allows investigation of certain problems from an algebraic perspective. Rational motions can be represented by polynomials over the ring of quaternions or dual quaternions.\n\n**Context and Significance**\nIn this context, factorization of a polynomial into polynomials of lower degree corresponds to the decomposition of a rational motion into \"simpler\" motions. One of the simplest non-trivial motions are rotations, which can be represented by linear polynomials. Linear polynomials generically represent rotational motions. Hence, a motion described by a polynomial that admits a factorization into linear factors can be realized by a mechanism whose revolute joints correspond to the linear factors.\n\n**Split Quaternions and Previous Work**\nA suitable model for motions in the hyperbolic plane is provided by the noncommutative ring of split quaternions. Unlike Hamiltonian quaternions, the presence of zero divisors makes the factorization theory of polynomials over split quaternions more complex. Previous research has examined factorization of quadratic split quaternion polynomials and zeros of higher-degree split quaternion polynomials. Based on motion factorization theory using quaternions and dual quaternions, researchers have developed characterizations of factorizability and adapted algorithms from the Euclidean setup.\n\n**Current Research Focus**\nIn this article, we consider rational motions in the hyperbolic plane, represented by polynomials over split quaternions. We extend previous results from the quadratic case to polynomials of arbitrary degree, with a focus on geometric interpretation of factorizability. We investigate the \"geometry\" of the factorization algorithm for generic cases and modify it to provably find all factorizations into linear factors, including special cases with infinite or zero factorizations.\n\n**Methodology and Applications**\nFor split quaternion polynomials without linear factor factorizations, we adopt a \"degree elevation technique\" from the Euclidean setup. Multiplying with a suitable real polynomial allows decomposition into linear factors without changing the underlying rational motion, enabling decomposition into hyperbolic rotations. Our approach emphasizes geometric considerations over algebraic ones.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\nIt's worth noting that the set of split quaternions is isomorphic to the fundamental algebra of real 2 \u00d7 2 matrices, making our results directly transferable.\n\n**Article Structure**\nThe article proceeds as follows:\n- Section 2: Definition of split quaternions and hyperbolic motions",
        "Here's my suggested restructuring of the text to improve its logical flow, organized into clear thematic sections:\n\n**Introduction and Background**\nElectromagnetic (EM) medical imaging in the microwave band is a relatively new modality, finding applications in the detection and characterisation of breast cancers, ischemic and haemorrhagic strokes, and torso imaging applications. The physical phenomenon that enables this modality is that the dielectric permittivity and conductivity of human tissues vary considerably over the microwave frequency band, particularly between healthy and unhealthy tissues. After transmitting and receiving signals through the body using antennas in known positions with known properties, an inverse scattering problem might be utilized. The solution of this problem can yield an image of the dielectric properties of the body under test, and hence the position of different tissue regions, allowing for disease localisation.\n\n**The Need for Boundary Information**\nThe imaging techniques currently reported in the literature typically require a priori information about the propagation or scattering model of the imaging domain. This need stems from the computational complexity of solving inverse scattering problems. Introducing the boundary of the imaged object can enhance detection accuracy and reduce computational complexity by providing a more accurate propagation model. Additionally, most biomedical imaging techniques use \"decluttering\" mechanisms that remove certain aspects of the scanned object, resulting in images that show only anomalies without object boundaries\u2014a format that clinicians find lacking in context.\n\n**Current Boundary Detection Methods and Limitations**\nWhile laser sensors represent the most accurate strategy for object surface detection, they present practical challenges in clinical settings. They must be synchronized with EM scans to prevent errors from subject movement, and their integration complicates the imaging system. These limitations suggest the need for utilizing the same EM data captured for imaging to detect boundaries\u2014a more cost-effective and convenient approach.\n\n**Previous Research on EM-Based Boundary Detection**\nPrevious research, particularly in breast imaging, has explored various approaches to boundary detection using EM data. These include:\n- Deconvolution of time-domain reflected signals\n- 2D matched filters for time delay approximation\n- Sparse data collection methods\nHowever, these approaches typically assume linear problem dynamics, despite evidence suggesting non-linear behavior.\n\n**Alternative Approaches and Their Limitations**\nThe Resonance Shift technique, based on manual feature extraction from scattered signals, has shown partial success but is limited by changing trends at different distances.",
        "Entropy is commonly understood as a measure of disorder. However, it can also be seen as a measure of uniformity and symmetry. As we will demonstrate, when constraints are absent, maximizing entropy leads to a uniform, equal-weight, or translation-invariant distribution. On the other hand, the introduction of information reduces entropy, creating nonuniformities. Symmetries, considered as uniformities across transformations or translations, naturally align with states of higher entropy. Therefore, the prevalence of symmetries in physics may not indicate a delicate, precariously maintained balance, but rather, a state of maximal entropy, given the constraints imposed by external forces. When stricter constraints are applied, certain symmetries may break, yet the system tends to maintain the most \"uniform\" or \"symmetric\" distribution, in line with the new constraints. Entropy, symmetry, and information are fundamental, appearing ubiquitously. In a mathematical context, the symmetries of a theory can be seen as dual to the axiomatic constraints of the theory.",
        "Long videos often demand a significant time investment and can easily lose a viewer's attention. Thus, efficiently presenting videos to users is a crucial and practical challenge in various video applications. For instance, consider home surveillance videos, which are typically recorded continuously throughout the day. Users might find it difficult to pinpoint a specific moment, like a package delivery, in an hour-long video. More generally, videos that are not meticulously edited, such as many YouTube videos, often contain irrelevant sections. These videos require content pre-processing to allow users to quickly access meaningful information.\n\nVideos are often composed of different modalities, primarily sequences of image frames. With advancements in recording devices and editing tools, videos can also include speech, as seen in YouTube videos recorded on smartphones, and subtitles, as in movies and TV shows. Research has shown that utilizing these different modalities can enhance various video tasks. However, it's important to note that these modalities can be quite noisy and redundant, featuring meaningless utterances, repeating frames, and more, which can lead to computational inefficiency and distract model learning.",
        "Over the past decade, images have been getting increasingly larger. Consumer cameras on smartphones now capture images at 4K resolution, which is roughly 8.3 million pixels, while professional DSLR cameras capture images at 8K resolution. In other fields, sensors on satellites and microscopes capture images with over a billion pixels. However, modern computer vision pipelines are limited by the memory in the systems they are trained upon, resulting in the development of models that only operate on small images.\n\nComputer vision practitioners often limit the size of images using two less-than-ideal methods: down-sampling or cropping. While these simple operations produce powerful models when measured against typical computer vision benchmarks, they result in the loss of high-frequency information or global context, which is crucial for many real-world tasks. For instance, consider a video feed of a football game captured in 8K resolution. A model attempting to determine where a player on the left side of the screen will pass the ball to on the right side cannot analyze the entire image in one pass. The image, the downstream model, and all intermediate tensors cannot fit into the memory of modern, large VRAM GPUs. A common approach is to process the image by treating it as individual \"windows,\" each fed through the model without sharing context, resulting in sub-optimal performance.\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce xT, a framework that allows myopic vision backbones to effectively integrate local and global context over large images. Our approach tackles the issues of quadratically-increasing GPU memory utilization and the integration of context across very large images. We achieve this by enhancing the strengths of hierarchical vision backbones through nested tokenization of images and processing resulting features with long-sequence models from the field of natural language processing, such as Transformer-XL and Mamba.\n\nThe key to our method is the nested tokenization of large images at multiple levels: at the region level for the region encoders and then at the patch level inside the encoders to capture local details. The image regions then undergo independent, hierarchical encoding by passing through a vision backbone that serves as a region encoder. Hierarchical region encoders yield down-sampled features, which, when combined with context encoders, allow us to process more regions simultaneously than typically possible. One such context encoder, Transformer-XL, is illustrated in Stage 2. It processes previous sequence tokens recurrently using cross-attention, significantly extending its context range with depth. The resulting sequence, enriched with both local and global context, is finally fed to a task-specific decoder.\n\nxT matches and surpasses the performance of competitive large image architectures on multiple downstream tasks that require large visual contexts, such as segmentation, detection, and classification.",
        "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) [1] is a well-known combinatorial optimization challenge where the objective is to determine a set of routes with minimal total costs. For each route, the total demand must not exceed the vehicle's capacity. In the literature, algorithms for solving VRP are generally categorized into exact and heuristic approaches. Exact algorithms provide optimal solutions but are not feasible for large-scale instances due to high computational complexity. Conversely, heuristic algorithms are often faster but lack theoretical guarantees. Considering the trade-off between optimality and computational costs, heuristic algorithms can find suboptimal solutions within an acceptable timeframe for large-scale cases. However, designing an effective heuristic algorithm is challenging, as it demands extensive problem-specific expertise and hand-crafted features. This raises the question: can we automatically learn a heuristic without human intervention? Inspired by recent advancements in machine learning, particularly deep learning, several studies [2][3][4][5][6][7] have explored using end-to-end neural networks to directly learn heuristics from data, eliminating the need for hand-engineered reasoning.\n\nIn the case of VRP, as depicted in Fig. 1, the problem instance is a set of nodes, and the optimal solution is a permutation of these nodes, viewed as a sequence of decisions. Hence, VRP can be regarded as a decision-making problem solvable through reinforcement learning. In reinforcement learning, the state is typically seen as a partial solution of the instance and the features of each node. The action represents the choice of the next node to visit, the reward is the negative tour length, and the policy corresponds to a heuristic strategy parameterized by a neural network. The policy is trained to make decisions that maximize the reward.",
        "It is well known that ensuring the safety of complex hybrid systems, such as cyber-physical systems (whether autonomous or not), cannot be accomplished solely through simulation and testing [8, 10]. The potential behaviors of these systems are so vast that testing and simulation alone cannot provide adequate coverage. To achieve a high level of confidence in correctness, it is essential to mathematically model the system and prove its properties using an automated reasoning system. Additionally, cyber-physical systems operate in uncertain environments, making the modeling of such systems a challenging task. Therefore, there is a need for a system that can reason about properties that encompass such uncertainties.\n\nDifferential Dynamic Logic (dDL) has emerged as a valuable tool for certifying hybrid systems [15, 16], with a practical implementation in the KeYmaera theorem prover [17]. This logic, akin to Propositional Dynamic Logic [5], introduces programs x = \u03b8dt & H that enable the system state to evolve continuously based on a differential equation x = \u03b8 for a non-deterministic amount of time, as long as the boundary condition H is met. The success of dDL can be attributed in part to the significant theoretical advancements made since its inception. Notably, the introduction of uniform substitution-based reasoning [15] facilitated a more concise axiomatization of dDL, leading to the transition from KeYmaera to KeYmaera X [6] with a reduced trusted code base. Furthermore, the incorporation of differential forms in the calculus provided a syntactic approach to reasoning about the derivatives of continuous dynamics, eliminating the need for side-conditions. More recently, the integration of definite descriptions in dLi [3] enabled reasoning about terms like \"the unique x such that P,\" essential for addressing terms that may not be universally defined, such as square roots.\n\nWhile dDL and its basic probabilistic extensions can only handle systems with fully deterministic continuous behavior, many hybrid systems are best represented using continuous stochastic processes. Stochastic Differential Dynamic Logic [12, 13] was devised to address reasoning about such systems in a dDL style. This logic extends the continuous programs to stochastic differential equations of the form x = \u03b8dt + \u03c3dW, where the evolution of x over time is influenced not only by \u03b8 but also by \u03c3 and an underlying continuous stochastic process W.\n\nIn this study, our objective is to develop the foundational theory necessary for a practical implementation of stochastic differential dynamic logic by introducing formalization with definite descriptions and differential forms in the uniform substitution style. Unlike the original sDL [13, 14], our formulation accommodates programs with true non-determinism, crucial for reasoning about hybrid systems with unspecified designs.",
        "Tactile perception is crucial for modern robotics, enhancing human-robot interaction and environmental awareness in autonomous robots.  Animals and humans rely heavily on tactile sensors in their skin and muscles for balance and agile movements [1], [2].  This principle, while fundamental in nature, has been less explored in legged robotics.  While visual feedback systems have received significant attention\u2014for example, Plagemann et al.'s laser range finders for surface adaptation [3], Sabe et al.'s stereo-vision system [4], and Chen et al.'s combined infrared and ultrasound sensors [5]\u2014tactile sensing offers a complementary approach.\n\nCurrent legged robots often utilize direct environmental feedback from sources like sonar, LIDAR, vision, and force feedback from joint actuators.  Several studies have explored alternative methods for surface estimation. These include joint position evaluation [6], Camurri et al.'s Pronto state estimator integrating RGB camera, LIDAR, and odometry data [7], Sarkisov et al.'s landing gear using foot-pad IMU orientation and joint angles [8], and Zhang et al.'s visual estimation of tactile patterns via a camera within the robot leg [9].  Furthermore, Smith et al. coupled foot contact sensors and IMU data for reinforcement learning of locomotion skills [10], and Luneckas et al. developed a hybrid tactile sensor system for obstacle navigation in hexapod robots [11].\n\nAdding tactile sensing to robot feet, mimicking the role of haptic sensing in animal locomotion, offers significant advantages for navigating challenging terrain.  Tactile sensors, like those employed in collaborative robots for enhanced environmental awareness through skin-like surfaces, can provide valuable information about surface properties when placed beneath a robot's feet.\n\nThis paper introduces the Touch Sensitive Foot (TSF), capable of recognizing surface textures using a trained CNN model.  This research provides an efficient pathway towards enhanced environmental awareness for autonomous robots, enabling predetermined gait adjustments for traversing unknown terrains.  This development mirrors the importance of tactile feedback in natural systems and offers a promising direction for improving legged robot locomotion.

        "Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a vital task in computer vision, involving the detection and tracking of multiple objects over time in a sequence of images. This technology can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as video surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and sports analysis. Despite numerous research methods proposed for MOT, challenges such as fragmented tracklets or ID switching, often caused by frequent occlusions in crowded scenes, persist. A promising solution is Multi-Camera Multi-Object Tracking (MC-MOT), which leverages information from multiple cameras. In this setup, objects occluded in one view may be visible in another, leading to more accurate tracking results.\n\nMost tracking-by-detection paradigms [1] utilize the Kalman filter [17] in the data association stage, serving as a motion model to predict the next possible position and match it with previous detections. However, this method is typically deterministic and struggles to adapt to dynamically changing environments. Achieving globally optimal tracking results is challenging due to variations in illumination, relative geometry distance, or sampling rates across different datasets, which are common in real-world scenarios. An alternative approach is reformulating the association problem into link prediction on graphs [5, 18, 25, 27]. This method allows a trainable model to determine the strength of the connection between two detections, enabling dynamic object association based on environmental conditions.\n\nNonetheless, current graph-based models for MC-MOT still face issues. Many approaches rely on a single-camera tracker to generate initial tracklets [13, 25, 27, 37]. Although several methods refine tracklets, single-view tracking errors often remain unaddressed. Additionally, these methods do not fully exploit the rich spatial and temporal information crucial for MC-MOT. Recently, spatial-temporal models have been used to learn representative features for tracklets. However, the resulting graphs are usually complex and difficult to optimize.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Reconfigurable Spatial-Temporal graph model (ReST) for MC-MOT to address these challenges. Our approach reformulates the MC-MOT problem into two sub-tasks: Spatial Association and Temporal Association. Spatial Association focuses on matching objects across different views, while Temporal Association uses temporal information, such as speed and time, to build temporal graphs that associate objects across frames. By dividing the problem into these sub-tasks, spatial and temporal consistency can be individually optimized for improved tracking results. Additionally, the graph model becomes more manageable and easier to optimize. To bridge the two association stages, we introduce a Graph Reconfiguration module that aggregates information from the spatial and temporal graph models. The benefits of graph reconfiguration are twofold: first, merging nodes of the same object results in a compact graph; second, iterative refinement of the graph model during each reconfiguration step enhances feature extraction and improves tracking results. As shown in Figure 1a, when the girl is occluded, fragmented tracklets lead to the ID switch problem. In Figure 1b, the correct object ID is retained by employing spatial and temporal consistency through Spatial Association, Temporal Association, and Graph Reconfiguration modules.\n\nThe proposed graph model is termed reconfigurable because the vertex and edge sets of spatial and temporal graphs are restructured to form a new graph at each moment, enabling adaptation to dynamic scenes. Unlike existing methods, our model does not rely on results from single-camera trackers. Instead, the tracking and association of detected objects are achieved by iteratively constructing spatial and temporal graphs. Our model is designed for online object tracking, as it does not rely on information from future frames.",
        "The use of graph structures is prevalent in various application scenarios [1, 2, 24], and graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained increasing attention due to their ability to leverage these structures. Graphs effectively model pairwise relationships between entities but fall short in capturing high-order relationships among multiple entities [3, 4, 5, 6]. As a generalized structure of graphs, hypergraphs address this limitation by defining a hyperedge as a collection of nodes that can connect more than two nodes. This extension of GNNs to hypergraphs allows for handling multi-modal data and capturing high-order correlations [23, 27].\n\nApplying GNNs to hypergraphs presents challenges due to the high-order relationships among multiple nodes represented by hyperedges. To address this, one can either preprocess the hypergraph structure to obtain a format compatible with graph convolution or define convolution operations directly on the hypergraph [15, 28]. A straightforward approach involves transforming the hypergraph into a simple graph that retains as much information as possible while only containing pairwise relationships, thus enabling the application of a GNN [7, 8, 9, 12]. Alternatively, defining convolution operations directly on the hypergraph structure preserves the comprehensive semantic relationships and higher-order interactions within the hypergraph, avoiding information loss [17, 18, 19, 20].\n\nDespite promising results, existing methods primarily focus on information propagation between nodes and hyperedges, often neglecting interactions among hyperedges. These interactions can effectively model high-order interactions among diverse entities/nodes that exist in real-world scenarios. Moreover, hyperedge features, representing these sets of nodes, can indicate the collective characteristics of the nodes, aiding in subsequent operations and downstream tasks. Therefore, incorporating hyperedge interactions into hypergraph convolution is valuable for capturing rich hyperedge information.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a Hyperedge Interaction-aware Hypergraph Neural Network (HeIHNN) model to learn hypergraph representation. Our approach integrates interactions between hyperedges into the hypergraph convolution process through a three-stage information propagation process: node-to-hyperedge (N2HE), hyperedge-to-hyperedge (HE2HE), and hyperedge-to-node (HE2N). First, we aggregate information from all nodes within each hyperedge to update the hyperedge's embedding. Next, we construct a hyperedge interaction graph based on relationships between hyperedges, enabling convolutional propagation at the hyperedge level. Lastly, we update the embeddings of all nodes within the hyperedges using acquired hyperedge features. For each stage, we design corresponding convolutions and incorporate attention mechanisms to capture the significance of different components. Additionally, we propose a hyperedge outlier removal mechanism that dynamically adjusts the hypergraph structure by identifying and removing outliers within hyperedges during information propagation. \n\nTo evaluate HeIHNN, we conduct experiments on five real-world datasets and compare our results with existing models. The experimental results demonstrate that HeIHNN achieves competitive performance by effectively incorporating information propagation between hyperedges and optimizing interaction between nodes and hyperedges. Our major contributions are as follows:\n- We propose HeIHNN, a novel hypergraph neural network model that integrates interactions between hyperedges into hypergraph convolution for representation learning of hypergraph structures. HeIHNN effectively handles high-order data and models relationships among hyperedges.\n- We introduce a hyperedge outlier removal mechanism during the information propagation process between nodes and hyperedges. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the hypergraph structure using learned embeddings, effectively removing outliers and enhancing the model's ability to handle noise and irrelevant information.\n- We conduct extensive experiments on node classification using five real-world datasets to validate the performance of HeIHNN.",
        "Live commenting is an emerging feature of online video platforms that enables real-time comments to fly across the screen or appear alongside the video, allowing viewers to engage with comments and video content simultaneously. Automatic live commenting seeks to enhance viewer interaction by providing additional opinions and responding to comments from other viewers, thus encouraging user engagement on online video sites. Moreover, it serves as an excellent testbed for models dealing with multi-modal information, requiring the integration of vision, text, and audio to produce video comments. As such, it is both an intriguing and vital task for human-AI interaction.\n\nDespite significant advancements in multimodal learning, live commenting remains a challenging endeavor. Recent research on live commenting utilizes an encoder-decoder model to generate comments. However, these models often fail to explicitly capture the interaction between video content and comments, resulting in comments that are generic and irrelevant to the specific video. Figure 1, for instance, demonstrates that encoder-decoder models tend to produce popular, generic comments, such as \"Oh, my God!\", in contrast to the more informative and video-relevant reference comments, like, \"The cat is afraid of spicy.\" This occurs because the encoder-decoder models prioritize the language model, neglecting the video-comment interaction, and, to minimize empirical risk, resort to generating frequent, safe, and, often, less meaningful comments.",
        "Consider the challenge of assigning a label to an object. In scenarios where label noise is minimal, predicting a single label is effective. However, in many applications, some data items may be ambiguous due to noise or occlusion. In such instances, even expert human annotators might disagree on the true label, opting instead to provide a list of possible answers while excluding classes that are evidently incorrect.\n\nResearch indicates that even on straightforward tasks, such as CIFAR-10, human annotators sometimes disagree (Peterson et al., 2019). Figure 1 illustrates this, showing images with varying levels of disagreement among annotators. The first row displays unambiguous images, while the second and third rows include images with, respectively, two and three possible classes. In all images, a single object is present, but, for some, the low image resolution prevents precise identification, leading to, for example, ambiguity among three classes. Nonetheless, filtering, or ruling out, some classes, remains beneficial in the presence of ambiguity.\n\nIn this paper, we explore an adaptive classification approach, allowing computational classifiers to, much like human experts, respond with a list of candidate labels.",

Panoramic images, with their 360\u00b0 field of view (FoV), provide comprehensive room contextual information that surpasses traditional perspective images. Recent advances in deep neural networks and the increasing accessibility of panoramic cameras have led to significant achievements in 3D room layout estimation from single panoramas.\n\n## Current Challenges and Limitations\n\nMost room layouts follow the Atlanta World assumption, featuring horizontal floors and ceilings with vertical walls. While the room layout can be represented by floor-boundary and room height, existing approaches face several limitations:\n\n1. Previous methods estimate room height using ceiling-boundary and predict floor and ceiling boundaries through the same output branch, leading to interference between horizontal shape and vertical height predictions.\n2. Current approaches either use Manhattan constraint or simplify boundaries in post-processing without considering wall planar attributes.\n3. Models that treat room layout estimation as 1D sequence prediction require sequence processors like Bi-LSTM, but lack specialized Transformer architectures for panoramic processing.\n\n## Proposed Solution: LGT-Net\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce LGT-Net, an efficient network for panoramic room layout estimation. Key features include:\n\n1. A feature extractor that converts panoramas to feature sequences\n2. A specialized Transformer architecture for sequence processing\n3. Dual output branches for direct prediction of room height and floor-boundary\n4. Horizon-depth representation for floor-boundary\n\n### Novel Loss Functions\n\nThe network implements two specialized loss functions:\n\n1.

These maps provide detailed, lane-level definitions and road network connectivity, offering the necessary context for prediction models, and aiding planning models in trajectory generation and optimization tasks.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that these applications often assume a static world, which, in practice, can be disrupted by changes in road layouts or temporary constructions, potentially leading to failures.",
        "Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance when train and test sets share the same distribution. However, domain shift\u2014the change in data distribution between training (source domain) and testing (target domain) sets\u2014significantly deteriorates generalizability [1, 2]. This issue is particularly pronounced in multi-center medical studies, where varying scanners, protocols, and patient populations across imaging centers contribute to this shift [2, 3].\n\nUnsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) [1, 2] aims to generalize large-scale models pre-trained on the source domain to an unlabeled target domain, eliminating the need for costly annotation.  This is typically achieved through fine-tuning, where a source-trained model is adapted to the target domain. However, fine-tuning creates a dedicated model for each target domain, replicating the parameter count of the original pre-trained model [4, 5].  Consequently, multiple target domains require multiple dedicated models, each with the same substantial parameter footprint.\n\nWhile UDA methods can be effective for single-target domain adaptation, resulting in a single model for a specific target domain, multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) aims to adapt to multiple unlabeled target domains simultaneously. MTDA offers broader applicability to real-world scenarios. However, training separate models for each target domain, each mirroring the source model's parameter count, is impractical and computationally expensive.\n\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has proven effective for Large Language Models (LLMs) [6]. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, PEFT freezes most model parameters while adapting a significantly smaller subset, often less than 5% of the total. This enables efficient learning and faster updates. PEFT can also outperform full fine-tuning and improve generalization, especially in low-data scenarios [6].\n\nIn medical imaging, few methods have employed adapter-based PEFT in Transformer-based architectures [7, 8]. These works focus on parameter-efficient transfer learning from natural to medical images. To our knowledge, neither the application of PEFT for UDA in medical imaging nor the use of adapter-based methods in CNNs has been explored [9].\n\nAddressing this gap, we propose a novel parameter-efficient MTDA method for medical image segmentation that is both computationally and memory efficient. First, we introduce Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (ConvLoRA), adapting Low-Rank Domain Adaptation (LoRA) from LLMs [4] for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  ConvLoRA addresses domain adaptation challenges specific to image data. Instead of creating multiple dedicated fine-tuned models, each replicating the base model's parameters, we inject several ConvLoRA adapters into the source-trained base model. Only the ConvLoRA parameters are adapted, while all other parameters remain frozen.",
        "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently gained attention as an innovative technology for the beyond fifth-generation (B5G) communication system. It is envisioned to significantly enhance communication coverage, throughput, and energy efficiency. IRS is a planar metasurface composed of reconfigurable passive elements controlled by a smart controller. This allows dynamic adjustment of signal reflections for purposes like signal power enhancement and interference suppression. Compared to traditional techniques such as active relaying/beamforming, IRS reflects signals in a full-duplex, noise-free manner, without self-interference, leading to energy savings and reduced hardware/deployment costs.\n\nNon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has also been a focus, showing superiority over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in conventional wireless systems. In downlink NOMA, the user with a stronger channel with the base station (BS) or access point (AP) utilizes successive interference cancellation (SIC) to cancel cochannel interference, based on user channel power gains. IRS, with its ability to reconfigure user channels, can change the user decoding order in NOMA, allowing for more flexible performance tradeoffs among users. However, the comparison between NOMA and OMA for IRS-assisted wireless communications is not well understood, necessitating further investigation.\n\nTo address this, a study was conducted to compare the theoretical performance between NOMA and OMA in an IRS-assisted downlink communication system, considering frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA) OMA schemes, as shown in Fig. 1. By formulating problems to minimize transmit power, the study revealed that the minimum transmit power of FDMA is consistently higher than TDMA and NOMA. The power comparison between NOMA and TDMA depends on user target rates and locations, with TDMA requiring lower power than NOMA for near-IRS, symmetric-rate user pairs, and vice versa.",
        "Super Resolution (SR) is an image processing technique that generates a higher resolution image from single or multiple low-resolution (LR) input images. SR aims at adding pixel density and high-frequency content (such as textures and edges) in the LR image. When low-resolution images are zoomed using upscaling techniques such as Lanczos resampling and interpolation, they become pixelated instead of providing more information. SR finds tremendous utility in areas where attention to detail is of utmost importance, such as in medical imagery, forensic analysis of surveillance feeds, satellite images, biometric systems, and person identification, etc.\n\nThis paper specifically focuses on the use of SR algorithms in offline forensic analysis of surveillance feeds. Due to its inherent nature, the surveillance environment mostly has uncontrolled and sporadic dynamics, affecting the quality of the surveillance feed, including factors such as occlusions, type of camera hardware, camera pose, limited bandwidth, varying illumination conditions, and background complexity, which, in turn, impact the process of identifying and monitoring individuals and related activities in the surveillance feeds, making the acquisition of a generic model for varying surveillance environments a complex task.",
        "A quantum computer can be programmed to carry out a given functionality in various ways, including the direct engineering of pulse sequences, the design of parametric quantum circuits via quantum machine learning, the use of adaptive measurements on cluster states, and the optimization of a program state operating on a fixed quantum processor. A fundamental result states there is no universal programmable quantum processor that operates with finite-dimensional program states. Since a quantum processor is universal if it can implement any quantum operation, this implies that the exact simulation of an arbitrary quantum channel on a single programmable quantum processor is impossible. Consequently, this highlights the importance of developing tools for the optimization of quantum programs.\n\nIn addressing these challenges, previous work explored the problem of approximately simulating a quantum channel using a finite-dimensional program state. It was proven that the error between the target channel and the simulated channel, as measured by the diamond distance and other related metrics, is convex in the space of program states. The optimal program state can be calculated using semidefinite programming. Expanding on this, the current study explores a more challenging setting where the channel to be simulated varies over time. It adopts a worst-case formulation where channel variations are arbitrary and potentially adversarial.\n\nTo tackle this dynamic setting, the framework of online convex optimization is proposed, which offers tools to track the optimal solution of time-varying convex problems. Specifically, an online mirror descent algorithm is developed and analyzed over the space of positive definite matrices, leading to a matrix exponentiated gradient descent (MEGD). MEGD had been previously used in the related problem of quantum state tracking.\n\nExperimental validation is conducted by using the generalized teleportation processor (GTP) as the programmable quantum processor. GTP can precisely simulate the class of teleportation-covariant channels, such as Pauli and erasure channels, and is operated here under adversarial settings with time-varying dephasing channels. The numerical results support the theoretical analysis, demonstrating sublinear regret of MEGD with respect to an optimized fixed program state.\n\nNotations and definitions employed throughout include: For any non-negative integer K, [K] represents the set {1, 2, ..., K}.

        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Evaluating and Improving NLP Models: A Comprehensive Analysis\n\n## Introduction to Model Evaluation Challenges\n\nThe standard paradigm for evaluating natural language processing (NLP) models relies on computing correctness metrics on held-out test sets from the same distribution as the training set. While this approach may effectively measure average performance with large, diverse test sets, it has several limitations:\n\n- Fails to account for worst-case performance\n- Overlooks model failures in cases where training data correlations don't hold\n- Does not indicate sources of model failure\n- Disregards important properties like fairness\n\n## Behavioral Testing as a Solution\n\nBehavioral testing has emerged as a complementary evaluation framework that systematically validates model capabilities through specific test stimuli. This approach uses test suites with input-output pairs that address specific linguistic or social phenomena.\n\n### Test Suite Hierarchy\n\nThe test suites are structured as a three-level hierarchy:\n\n1. Functionality classes (highest level)\n   - Capture system capabilities (fairness, robustness, negation)\n2. Functionalities\n   - Target finer-grained aspects of each capability\n3. Test cases\n   - Input-output pairs that validate model behavior\n\n## The Behavioral Testing Dilemma\n\nWhile behavioral test suites effectively identify model weaknesses, addressing these weaknesses presents a challenge:\n\n- Fine-tuning on failure cases can improve performance but risks overfitting\n- Not using test suite feedback misses opportunities to improve model trustworthiness\n- Even with split test cases, models may exploit data artifacts\n\n## Introducing BELUGA\n\nTo address these challenges, we present BELUGA (Behavioural Learning Unified Generalisation Analysis), a general method that:\n\n1. Measures model performance on unseen phenomena through structured cross-validation\n2. Handles different types of behavior measures\n3. Proposes specialized loss functions for various test types\n\n### Key Contributions\n\n1. Design of BELUGA analysis method\n2. Extended training configurations beyond simple fine-tuning\n3. Aggregate metrics for measuring generalization across different granularities\n4. Comparative analysis of regularization techniques across NLP tasks\n\n## Research Findings\n\nOur investigation reveals:\n\n- Naive optimization leads to over-optimistic scenarios\n- Fine-tuning on suite data shows improvements for seen functionalities but can degrade performance on unseen cases\n- Including both i.i.d. and test suite samples in training:\n  - Prevents performance degradation\n  - Improves scores for unseen functionalities\n  - Can enhance i.i.d. performance in specific cases\n\nThis restructured version presents the information in a more logical progression, moving from the problem statement through the proposed solution and its implications. The addition of clear section headers and bullet points improves readability and helps readers follow the argument's development.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, enhanced for clarity and flow while maintaining the technical content:\n\n# Forward Kinematics in Robotics: A Novel Neural Network Approach\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn robotics, one crucial challenge is understanding the mapping relationship between joint space and end-effector pose space\u2014known as the kinematics problem. This relationship is fundamental to both motion planning and control. The analysis becomes particularly challenging for robots with complex or closed-loop structures. The Gough-Stewart platform (GSP) [1], a classic parallel mechanism featuring a closed-loop design, exemplifies these challenges. Due to the unique characteristics of parallel robot structures, determining its forward kinematics can be exceptionally complex [2]. While researchers have proposed various solutions, no single method currently achieves both high precision and computational efficiency. This gap has driven continued research in the parallel manipulator community for more robust forward kinematics methods.\n\n## Neural Network Applications\n\nNeural networks (NNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning mapping relationships and providing real-time solutions. In parallel manipulator research, this began with single-layer multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) [3, 4]. Similar NN applications appear in studies of non-parallel structures [5, 6]. However, while NNs have opened new possibilities for solving complex mechanism kinematics, most implementations rely on basic MLPs using Euler angles for output representation. This traditional approach struggles to achieve high-precision pose outputs with limited datasets, primarily due to two factors:\n\n1. Traditional MLPs exhibit weak inductive biases [7], though such biases are crucial for deep neural network advances\n2. Direct rotation regression requires more sophisticated differentiable non-Euclidean representations beyond four dimensions [8]\n\n## Our Novel Approach\n\nSeeking to develop a network capable of both high-precision pose outputs and real-time solutions, we leverage the complex structure of parallel manipulators to construct a graph and apply message-passing graph neural networks (GNN). GNNs, known for their permutation equivariance, have demonstrated success across numerous fields [9]. However, implementing GNN techniques raises a crucial question: what input representation best serves forward kinematics learning? While GNNs typically use node coordinates as input features, these coordinates are not known a priori in forward kinematics. For the GSP, physical connection lengths are more readily available. We address this challenge by utilizing the graph distance matrix as GNN input.\n\n## Technical Innovations\n\nRecent research has highlighted traditional GNNs' limitations in effectively utilizing distance matrices for geometric learning [10-12], primarily due to their limited expressive power [12]. Building on Li et al.'s work [13] with k-WL/FWL algorithms and k-DisGNNs, we develop a highly expressive Distance Graph Neural Network (DisGNet) for forward kinematics learning. DisGNet employs 9D-SVD orthogonalization [15] for rotation representation, achieving high-precision pose outputs with parameter efficiency comparable to traditional MLP methods.\n\n## Two-Stage Framework\n\nTo further enhance precision, we combine DisGNet with an optimized Newton-Raphson method, creating a novel two-stage framework (DisGNet + GPU-friendly Newton-Raphson), as illustrated in Fig. 1. Our GPU-friendly implementation accelerates computations by efficiently approximating the Moore-Penrose inverse through matrix-matrix multiplication, enabling real-time processing on GPU platforms.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. Development of DisGNet: A highly expressive GNN optimized for learning geometric features from distances, delivering high-precision poses with efficient parameter usage\n2. Implementation of GPU-friendly Newton-Raphson: A novel two-stage framework enabling ultra-high precision output and real-time forward kinematics solving\n3. Introduction of refined evaluation metrics for forward kinematics learning models, accompanied by comprehensive dataset and benchmark results to benefit the parallel manipulator research community",
        "Deep neural networks have proven incredibly powerful across a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, they are highly sensitive to small input perturbations, which can dramatically reduce their accuracy (Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Szegedy et al., 2013). In natural language processing (NLP), these adversarial examples often take the form of spelling mistakes, synonyms, or other meaning-preserving transformations that alter the network's prediction (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a; Michel et al., 2019).\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of training robust models over natural language\u2014or more generally, sequences over a finite alphabet\u2014that are resilient to adversarial examples.  The discrete nature of the adversarial space for sequences makes it difficult to explore efficiently using gradient-based optimization techniques common in computer vision.  A common approach to achieving robustness is adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018), which has been extensively researched in computer vision and, more recently, in NLP (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a; Michel et al., 2019).  Given a perturbation space R(x) for a sample x\u2014for example, if x is a sentence, R(x) might contain all possible misspellings up to a certain limit\u2014adversarial training incorporates an adversary into the training objective. Instead of computing the loss for a sample (x, y), it computes the loss for the worst-case perturbed sample z \u2208 R(x). Formally, the adversarial loss for (x, y) is max z\u2208R(x) L(z, y, \u03b8).\n\nThe central question of this paper is: Can we train models robust against rich perturbation spaces over strings?\n\nThe practical challenge lies in computing this worst-case loss. The perturbation space R(x) can be enormous, making exhaustive enumeration impractical, especially in NLP tasks where R(x) should contain semantically equivalent inputs, such as variations of x with typos or synonyms.  Therefore, we need to approximate the adversarial loss.  Two classes of approximation techniques exist:\n\n* **Augmentation:** This class computes a lower bound on the adversarial loss by exploring a finite subset of R(x). This is typically done using gradient-based attacks like Hot-Flip (Ebrahimi et al., 2018) for NLP or Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) for computer vision.  These techniques effectively augment the training set with perturbed samples.\n\n* **Abstraction:** This class computes an upper bound on the adversarial loss by overapproximating, or abstracting, the perturbation space R(x) into a set of symbolic constraints that can be efficiently propagated through the network.  Interval abstraction, for instance, has been used in several works (Mirman et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019).\n\nBoth techniques can be suboptimal: augmentation may severely underapproximate the worst-case loss, while abstraction may severely overapproximate it.  Furthermore, they exhibit complementary utility, performing well on some perturbation spaces but not others. For example, Huang et al. (2019) showed that abstraction works better for token substitutions, while augmentation-based techniques like Hot-Flip (Ebrahimi et al., 2018) and MHA (Zhang et al., 2019a) are more general, applying to token deletions and insertions as well.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the numerical minimization of the Canham-Helfrich-Evans bending energy \\(W(\\partial\\Omega) = 2\\kappa_b \\partial\\Omega(H - H_0)^2 ds\\), with \\(\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3\\) being a bounded domain, subject to volume and area constraints. Here, the positive constants \\(V_0\\) and \\(A_0\\) satisfy the isoperimetric inequality. The mean curvature of \\(\\partial\\Omega\\), denoted by \\(H := \\frac{1}{2}(\\kappa_1 + \\kappa_2)\\), represents its principal curvatures \\(\\kappa_1\\) and \\(\\kappa_2\\), \\(2H_0\\) is the spontaneous curvature, and \\(\\kappa_b\\) is the bending elastic constant. We will use \\(S := \\partial\\Omega\\) as an abbreviation, where \\(S\\) encloses the volume \\(\\Omega\\). This energy model (1.1) is proposed to simulate membranes like vesicles and red blood cells.\n\nThe numerical treatment of this problem is challenging as computing the mean curvature typically involves the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the normal field, requiring a certain smoothness of the surface. Shapes are commonly approximated with continuous, non-smooth triangulations, posing the question of computing/approximating the appropriate curvature. Despite the complexity, various approaches have been suggested. Methods based on discrete differential geometry (DDG) approximate the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and the minimization is achieved by differentiating the discrete energy and following a negative gradient. A popular discretization method involves the finite difference cotangent scheme on a Voronoi area, also computing Gaussian curvature in terms of the angle deficit.\n\nThe shape derivative of geometric quantities and the full Canham-Helfrich-Evans energy have been computed, involving fourth-order derivatives and the Gauss curvature of the shape. Techniques such as boundary integral methods and surface finite element methods (SFEM) have been employed for approximating surface shapes. Smooth surface approximations using high-order B-splines or subdivision algorithms have also been explored to maintain continuity in the normal vector field.\n\nLevel set and phase field approaches discretize the full space, representing the surface implicitly via a level set function. Time-stepping algorithms are often used to find stationary solutions or for dynamic tests, with Dziuk's algorithm being a popular choice. This work introduces a novel discretization method based on lifting the distributional curvature to a more regular auxiliary curvature field. By considering the element-wise shape operator and the angle of the normal vector jump between adjacent elements, the full curvature can be described efficiently.\n\nThe paper's main contributions include a new numerical scheme for discretizing the Canham-Helfrich-Evans bending energy, distributional curvature derivation in the context of FEM, rigorous computation of the first variation of the discretized bending energy, and numerical minimization of the bending energy using a gradient-type algorithm based on the first variation.",
        "Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a promising technology for the sequencing of DNA, but it is limited by distortions imposed by the physics of the sequencer. A complete model of the nanopore sequencer has not yet been established in the research community. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to introduce a model suitable for developing codes that enable reliable data storage in synthetic DNA when using nanopore sequencing for the reading operation.\n\nThe nucleotides adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T) connected to a sugar-phosphate backbone molecule form the bases, the primary elements of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). These bases create arbitrary length sequences that can be seen as an alphabet {A, T, C, G}.\n\nThe nanopore is a microscopic pore that accommodates \u03c4 nucleotides for a random duration determined by a motor protein that shifts nucleotides one by one through the nanopore. Simultaneously, an ionic electrical current flowing through the nanopore is uniquely disturbed by the nucleotides inside it at any given time and is sampled by the sequencer at a frequency fs. By measuring the current level through an output function f, the nanopore sequencer estimates the state of the system defined by the bases in the nanopore. However, several distortions reduce the reliability of detection:\n- Random dwell times (sample duplications): Fluctuations in the motor protein operation result in a random number of samples per nucleotide.\n- Fading: Minor variability in the physical dimensions of the nanopores slightly changes the current level for each nucleotide.\n- Inter-symbol interference (ISI): The detection of a single base is distorted by interference from neighboring bases in the electrical current.\n- Noisy measurements: Each sample is distorted by measurement noise, with occasional backsteps (tandem duplications) and deletions observed in experimental data.\n\nA tractable channel model must be selected before applying information-theoretic methods to the nanopore sequencer. Our channel model incorporates inter-symbol interference, noisy measurements, and duplications, based on a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) extended to include duplications. Fading is not included, as its effect can be accounted for as additional measurement noise, and deletions can be eliminated by adjusting the sampling rate relative to the motor protein's speed.\n\nThe primary contribution of this work is establishing a tractable channel that models the dominant distortions in nanopore sequencing. Secondary contributions include generalizing MAP detection algorithms and estimating achievable rates using methods analogous to existing literature. The paper is organized as follows: preliminaries on (hidden) Markov and semi-Markov chains are presented in Section II, the noisy nanopore channel is introduced in Section III, detection algorithms are derived in Section IV, achievable information rates are computed in Section V, and numerical results are presented in Section VI.",
        "Ever since Bousquet and Elisseeff [4] unveiled a fundamental connection between generalization error and algorithmic stability, which gauges a learning algorithm's sensitivity to perturbations in training data, one of the central objectives in statistical learning theory is to establish generalization error bounds for learning algorithms. This assessment helps to determine the difference between the population risk of learned parameters and their empirical risk on training data. Numerous studies have used the framework of uniform stability to investigate generalization properties in gradient-based methods, encompassing both convex and non-convex settings (e.g. [18; 29; 32; 26; 14; 2; 24; 13; 12; 25; 22; 47]).\n\nA line of research has focused on understanding the generalization properties resulting from the incorporation of artificial noise into stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, as initiated by Keskar et al.

        "Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) holds transformative potential across diverse fields, from computer science and creative arts to language processing. While its efficacy is proven in areas like medicine and healthcare, its application in engineering domains, specifically urban planning and architectural design, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the use of genAI, particularly generative design methodologies, for intervention planning in urban environments.\n\nUrban green space (UGS) availability is crucial for the health and well-being of urban residents. Studies show beneficial associations between green space exposure and reduced stress, improved mood, better mental health, and decreased psychological distress, particularly in adolescents [14]. However, significant disparities exist in UGS accessibility between Northern and Southern European cities, with the former enjoying above-average availability and the latter facing below-average access [7].  This underscores the need for innovative intervention planning strategies, which this paper aims to address through genAI.\n\nGenerative design, employing advanced algorithms and computational techniques, offers a systematic approach to automating the design process.  By defining parameters and constraints, generative design can produce numerous design scenarios.  This research extends its application to multi-scale intervention planning, encompassing architectural design and urban revitalization, to harness genAI's potential for transforming urban landscapes.\n\nThe primary objective is to showcase the potential of generative AI models in these applications.  We introduce a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) Desktop application developed for generating images and implementing generative design in real-world scenarios.  Through experimentation and case studies, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this technology for intervention planning, offering insights into its practical implications for shaping future urban environments.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review; Section 3 describes the experimental setup; Section 4 presents the results; and Section 5 concludes the work.",

Thanks to advancements in techniques like residual connections and batch normalization, training very deep models with thousands of layers on powerful GPU or TPU clusters has become easier. For instance, training a ResNet model on a popular image recognition benchmark with millions of images takes less than ten minutes, while training a powerful BERT model for language understanding takes no more than an hour and a half. Despite the remarkable success of large-scale deep models, the substantial computational complexity and extensive storage requirements pose a significant challenge in deploying them in real-time applications, particularly on devices with limited resources like video surveillance and autonomous driving cars.\n\nTo address the challenge of deploying deep models in resource-constrained environments, recent research has primarily focused on developing efficient building blocks for deep models.

        "Data visualization has been broadly applied to communicate data and information in an effective and expressive manner. Recently, an emerging trend has been to combine narrative and storytelling with visualization. The norms of communicative and exploratory information visualization are used in narrative visualizations to tell the desired story. However, creating visualizations with narrative information is a challenging and time-consuming task. Such a creation usually requires data analytic skills and visualization design expertise. Even experts need to spend much time and effort creating an ideal visualization for a specific design scenario. Therefore, by summarizing the experience in practice, researchers specify various design spaces and visualization scenarios for distinct narrative genres, which guide users to create narrative visualizations.\n\nWith the emergence of new user requirements and the advancement of automation technology, an increasing number of intelligent tools have been created to assist the visual creative process. Authoring tools offer rich interactions that allow users to control the creation process. However, such tools still require users to decide on each visualization element manually. To further weaken the barriers and reduce the burdens of creation, researchers have developed ML/AI-supported tools and ML/AI generator tools to support a more automatic process. ML/AI-supported tools usually provide recommendations as part of the narrative visualization creation process, requiring users to make their design choices. However, ML/AI-generator tools do not need user expertise in visualization and can generate a complete set of visualization designs without user intervention.\n\nOver the past few years, related surveys of automated techniques have focused on the automation of traditional statistical charts. Automatic tools that support various genres of narrative visualizations have not been sufficiently investigated. Systematic reviews on how automation shapes visual design and visual narrative processes are generally lacking. The narrative process describes the primary responsibilities and actions of data visualization storytellers and the types of artifacts that result from these activities. Most previous studies aim at the creation process from the visual design level. Advances in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction have brought more opportunities and challenges to this field. Therefore, a state-of-the-art survey is required to provide a better understanding of automation involvement in narrative visualization creation tools.\n\nTo address this gap, we collected 91 design spaces and tools covering the six genres of narrative visualization and classified them into four automation levels. This allowed us to describe how automatic techniques could be progressively used in visualization design and visual narrative, enabling users to create data visualizations. By analyzing the tools of each narrative visualization genre, we compared the focus of the four levels of tools in each narrative genre to help users select the appropriate tool for different scenarios.",
        "This paper studies Probabilistic Almost-Sure Termination (PAST) for imperative programs augmented with bounded nondeterministic and probabilistic choice.  We establish a deep connection between PAST and the termination of programs with (un)bounded nondeterminism and fair termination.  Specifically, we show that deciding PAST is \u03a0<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>-complete, matching the complexity of termination for programs with countable nondeterminism.\n\nThis complexity result is further underscored by our construction, for each recursive ordinal *o* < Church-Kleene ordinal (CK<sub>1</sub>), of a probabilistic program *P*(*o*) such that *o* is well-founded if and only if *P*(*o*) is PAST.  This demonstrates that transfinite ordinals up to CK<sub>1</sub> are necessary for proving PAST.  This contrasts with Almost-Sure Termination (AST) and Bounded AST (BAST) which do not require transfinite reasoning.  Typically, AST and BAST proofs employ ranking supermartingales mapping program states to reals, demonstrating a minimum expected decrease with each transition.  Our work reveals that this approach is insufficient for PAST.  We illustrate this in Section 2 with a stochastic Hydra game, a PAST program requiring ordinals up to CK<sub>1</sub> to prove termination.  Since the complexity of valid statements in standard arithmetic is \u0394<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>, relative completeness results for PAST necessitate more powerful proof systems.\n\nTo address this, we introduce a sound and complete proof rule for a special normal form, which we call *Knievel form*,  effectively constructible for any probabilistic program.  This proof rule uses two key components: a ranking function from program states to ordinals up to CK<sub>1</sub>, where only terminal states are ranked zero, and a state-dependent certificate based on ranking supermartingales, bounding the expected time to reach a lower-ranked state independent of the scheduler.\n\nThis proof rule is complete for *all* probabilistic programs: a suitable rank and certificate can always be extracted.  Crucially, soundness is guaranteed for Knievel form programs: the existence of a ranking function and supermartingale certificate implies bounded expected running time.  However, the rule is *not* sound for general programs.  Therefore, our complete proof system involves first transforming a program into Knievel form and then applying the proof rule.\n\nOur core results are summarized as follows:\n\n1. Deciding PAST for probabilistic programs with bounded nondeterministic and probabilistic choice is \u03a0<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>-complete.\n\n2. For any probabilistic program *P*, there is an effectively constructible Knievel form program *P'* and non-probabilistic programs *P*<sub>1</sub> (bounded nondeterministic choice) and *P*<sub>2</sub> (unbounded choice) such that *P* is PAST iff *P'* is PAST iff *P*<sub>1</sub> is fairly terminating iff *P*<sub>2</sub> is terminating.\n\n3. For any recursive ordinal *o*, there is a probabilistic program *P*(*o*) such that *o* is well-founded iff *P*(*o*) is PAST. Hence, proving PAST requires ordinals up to CK<sub>1</sub>.\n\n4. There is a sound and complete proof rule for Knievel form programs using a ranking function to CK<sub>1</sub> and ranking supermartingales.

Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) presents significant challenges in computer vision, primarily due to three key factors:\n\n1. Target size limitations (objects smaller than 20 pixels)\n2. Complex, highly textured backgrounds that generate numerous false alarms\n3. Learning constraints, including limited dataset size, low diversity, and severe class imbalance between target and background pixels\n\nDeep learning has revolutionized object detection over the past decades, leveraging large annotated datasets to extract task-specific non-linear features. In IRSTD applications, semantic segmentation neural networks (NN) have become predominant [1], with notable implementations including ACM [2], LSPM [3], and the state-of-the-art DNANet [4]. DNANet's architecture combines nested UNets with a multiscale fusion module to effectively segment small objects of varying sizes.\n\nHowever, segmentation-based approaches face a significant limitation: object fragmentation can occur during segmentation map binarization, leading to false alarms and compromised counting metrics. While object detection algorithms like Faster-RCNN [5] and YOLO [6] mitigate this risk through explicit bounding box regression, they often struggle with tiny object detection. Few studies have explored adapting these detectors for IRSTD [7], and comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art IRSTD methods remain lacking.\n\n## Our Contribution\n\nWe introduce OL-NFA (Object-Level Number of False Alarms), a novel YOLO detection head specifically engineered for small object detection. This module incorporates an a contrario decision criterion that:\n\n- Guides feature extraction to highlight unexpected objects against the background\n- Re-evaluates objectness scores computed by the YOLO backbone\n- Maintains compatibility with backpropagation during training\n\nThe a contrario paradigm's key advantage lies in its focus on background modeling, where data is abundant, rather than modeling objects directly. This approach effectively addresses class imbalance and limited training data challenges by detecting objects through background hypothesis rejection.\n\n### Key Contributions\n\n1. Development of a novel YOLO detection head incorporating a contrario criterion for objectness score estimation, reducing dependence on extensive training samples\n2.",
        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 2000) is a strongly-lexicalized grammar formalism that imposes tight constraints on the constituents formed by rich syntactic categories at the lexical level. Its syntax-semantics interface has found applications in downstream tasks such as semantic parsing and machine translation.\n\nMost CCG parsers follow a pipeline approach, with 'supertagging' as the initial step. Supertagging involves sequence labeling using complex 'supertags' that signal valency information through forward and backward slashes. This step is crucial in resolving syntactic ambiguity and sets the stage for parsing by combining constituents based on general rules.\n\nA primary challenge in CCG supertagging is the large and open-ended tagset to encompass various syntactic constructions. Many supertags are rare or unseen even in extensive training datasets like the Penn Treebank, leading to a heavy-tailed distribution. The existing approach of considering only frequently occurring supertags limits the generalizability of parsers and hinders performance on rare tags.\n\nTo address this challenge, a new constructive framework is proposed in this paper, where supertags are constructed as tree structures instead of being treated as fixed labels. This innovative approach allows the model to predict rare and unseen tags while maintaining performance on common ones. Experiments on English CCGbank demonstrate the effectiveness of this tree-structured supertag generation approach.\n\nThe key contributions of this work are threefold: firstly, introducing a novel constructive supertagger that generates each lexical category as a tree; secondly, applying this model to English CCG supertagging to improve predictive performance on rare and unseen supertags; and thirdly, conducting detailed analyses to examine the impact of different modeling and inference choices on the task of predicting supertags.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed constructive framework for generating supertags as tree structures represents a significant advancement in addressing the long-tail problem in CCG supertagging. By enhancing the ability to predict rare and unseen tags without compromising performance on common ones, this model opens up new possibilities for improving the accuracy and generalizability of CCG parsers.",

While graphs serve as the primary representation in domains like social networks [3, 31] and recommendation systems [6], our focus lies on molecular graphs\u2014fundamental to drug discovery, molecular property prediction [13, 23], and virtual screening [56, 64].\n\nMolecular graphs possess distinct characteristics that set them apart from conventional graph types:\n\n1. **Structure**: Each molecule is represented as a compact graph of atoms and bonds, resulting in relatively small graph sizes.\n\n2. **Diversity**: Despite their small size, molecules exhibit remarkable structural heterogeneity due to continuous development across various applications.\n\n3. **Multi-dimensional Labeling**: Molecules can be labeled across multiple independent dimensions, making the learning process inherently multi-task oriented. For example, a molecule may be labeled for both its potential interactions with diabetes medications and its toxicity under specific conditions.\n\n4. **Limited Data Access**: Molecular property analysis requires resource-intensive laboratory experiments, often resulting in partially labeled molecules despite known graph structures. Additionally, molecules represent valuable intellectual property, leading institutions to maintain proprietary graph representations that cannot be shared due to competitive and regulatory constraints.\n\nFederated Learning (FL) addresses this data isolation challenge by enabling collaborative training among multiple clients without centralizing data, while maintaining user-level privacy [42, 26]. However, training GNNs in a federated setting presents several challenges:\n\n- Poor performance in non-IID settings [20], which is typical for molecular graphs where owners may possess different molecules or incomplete label sets\n- Practical limitations of central server-based communication when competing entities wish to collaborate\n- Complexity of designing systems that can handle both partial labels and serverless operations\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce SpreadGNN, a multitask federated learning framework designed to operate with partial labels in a serverless environment (Figure 1). Our approach incorporates:\n\n1. A multitask learning (MTL) formulation for partial label learning\n2. Decentralized periodic averaging stochastic gradient descent (DPA-SGD) for serverless MTL optimization, supported by theoretical convergence guarantees\n\nWe validate SpreadGNN through graph-level molecular property prediction and regression tasks, using non-IID and partially labeled datasets derived from the MoleculeNet [69] benchmark. Our experimental results demonstrate that SpreadGNN achieves superior performance compared to FedAvg [44], both in fully connected and partially connected client networks. We will release our source code and datasets to facilitate further research in this domain.\n\n2 SpreadGNN Framework",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# The Challenge of Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Text-Only Tasks\n\n## Introduction and Background\n\nTraining language models solely on text has faced criticism from multiple angles - from fundamental arguments about language acquisition (Bender and Koller, 2020) to identified gaps in text-based information (Gordon and Van Durme, 2013; Paik et al., 2021). To address these limitations, researchers have proposed developing multimodal language models that learn from multiple information sources (Bisk et al., 2020).\n\nVision-and-language (VL) models represent a key development in this direction. Trained on images paired with captions or visual questions, these models have demonstrated strong performance on tasks like image captioning and Visual Question Answering (VQA) (Lu et al., 2019; Tan and Bansal, 2019; Su et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020). Recently, there has been growing interest in understanding how their multimodal training influences their natural language understanding capabilities (Iki and Aizawa, 2021; Yun et al., 2021).\n\n## The Adaptation Challenge\n\nHowever, evaluating the pure natural language understanding of VL models presents a unique challenge - their language processing is inherently tied to visual features. While we may want to assess these models on text-only tasks, they weren't originally designed for this purpose. Without proper adaptation methods, we risk out-of-distribution evaluation that fails to accurately measure their language understanding capabilities.\n\nWhile some methods for adapting VL models to text-only input have been explored (Iki and Aizawa, 2021; Yun et al., 2021), there hasn't been a systematic investigation of optimal adaptation approaches. This gap needs to be addressed to ensure accurate evaluation of multimodal models' language understanding capabilities.\n\n## Research Contributions\n\nOur work makes the following key contributions:\n\n1. We conduct a comparative analysis of seven methods for adapting three VL models (LXMERT, VisualBERT, and CLIP-BERT) to text-only input (Section 3), including two previously used adaptation methods.\n\n2. We evaluate these adaptations through:\n   - The GLUE benchmark for general natural language understanding (Section 4.1)\n   - The Visual Property Norms (VPN) for assessing visual conceptual knowledge (Section 4.2)\n\n3. We provide comparative analysis by:\n   - Benchmarking adapted VL models against their unimodal BERT-base counterparts\n   - Comparing performance with FLAVA, a multimodal model designed to handle text-only tasks without adaptation\n\nThis comprehensive evaluation aims to provide deeper insights into the natural language understanding capabilities of VL models and the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies.",
        "Here's a restructured and more coherent version of the text:\n\n# The Evolution and Impact of Artificial Intelligence\n\n## Definition and Fundamentals\nThe term \"artificial intelligence\" refers to reproducing human intelligence processes using machines, specifically computer systems. AI systems differ fundamentally from expert systems, which are collections of rules programmed by humans in the form of if-then statements. While expert systems attempt to formalize human intelligence through rules in a top-down approach, they cannot learn autonomously from external data and perform poorly in tasks like vision, sound, and language understanding compared to AI systems.\n\n## Classification and Capabilities\nAccording to research, AI systems can be classified into three distinct categories:\n- Analytical AI\n- Human-Inspired AI\n- Humanized AI\n\nThis classification is based on intelligence capabilities including cognitive, emotional, social intelligence, and artistic creativity. The benchmark for AI intelligence remains the Turing test, where a machine is considered intelligent if a human cannot distinguish it from another human during interaction.\n\n## Applications and Benefits\nSince its advent, AI has revolutionized numerous sectors:\n- Business operations\n- Healthcare services\n- Information technology\n- Banking systems\n- Transportation\n- Robotics\n\nIn the United States, AI applications have led to:\n- Improved operational efficiency\n- Cleaner product development\n- Reduced environmental impact\n- Enhanced public safety\n- Better human health outcomes\n\n## Ethical Considerations\nUntil recently, discussions about AI ethics were primarily confined to academic institutions and non-profit organizations. However, the landscape has shifted dramatically.",
        "Deep learning holds immense promise for revolutionizing medicine, yet its integration into clinical practice faces a significant hurdle: trustworthiness.  Doctors and patients need to trust the AI's diagnostic capabilities, requiring not just high accuracy but also clear explanations and reliable decision-making processes.  This study addresses this challenge by focusing on building inherently interpretable models for medical AI, specifically targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis.\n\nExplainability and reliability are paramount for trustworthy medical AI.  Explainability ensures that the rationale behind an AI's diagnosis is transparent, increasing acceptance among patients and clinicians. Reliability, on the other hand, guarantees that predictions are based on relevant patterns rather than spurious correlations or biases, often referred to as \"Clever Hans\" behavior.  While post-hoc explainability tools exist for complex black-box models, they can be unreliable.  Therefore, this paper prioritizes building interpretable models, providing insights into their decision-making process during the training phase itself.\n\nExisting AD diagnostic models often rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which, despite their performance, lack interpretability, hindering their clinical adoption.  Further complicating matters, AD diagnosis frequently involves multiple modalities like CT and MRI scans.  While combining these modalities can improve accuracy, it poses a further challenge for interpretable model design.  This work tackles these challenges by introducing a novel approach that guides the training process to penalize reliance on irrelevant cues, even if the predictions are correct.  This ensures the model learns genuine patterns, promoting reliability and generalizability to unseen data.\n\nSpecifically, we propose an interpretable, multimodal model for classifying AD across its various stages, from early detection (mild cognitive impairment) to more severe forms.  This fine-grained classification surpasses existing approaches that typically offer only binary classifications or combine multiple stages.  Our model leverages a novel Jacobian-Augmented Loss function (JAL) incorporating Jacobian Saliency Maps (JSM) as a model self-debugger.  JSMs, calculated during preprocessing, highlight relevant image regions, enhancing both model precision and interpretability.  This modality-agnostic approach seamlessly integrates multiple data sources, focusing on images, a crucial aspect for early AD detection.\n\nThe JAL function not only guides the model toward accurate predictions but also penalizes reliance on incorrect cues, mimicking a debugging process.  This ensures the model avoids Clever Hans behavior, learning from genuine patterns and increasing the trustworthiness of its predictions.  Furthermore, the use of JSM provides insights into the model's decision-making, making it more transparent and interpretable.\n\nIn summary, this paper contributes:\n\n*   A novel loss function, JAL, incorporating JSM for model self-debugging, improving both accuracy and interpretability.\n*   Multimodal data fusion using two distinct techniques, demonstrating JAL's adaptability to various modalities.\n*   Fine-grained, four-class AD classification, exceeding the accuracy of existing coarse-grained approaches.\n*   Comprehensive evaluation, including an ablation study, validating the efficacy of JSM for reliable predictions and trustworthy interpretations.  This work addresses the critical need for trustworthy AI in medicine, paving the way for greater clinical adoption of AI-driven diagnostic tools.",
        "Modern computing systems are experiencing a surge in data processing demands. Data plays a crucial role in a wide array of contemporary and anticipated future workloads and systems. Whether operating on cloud servers or mobile platforms, significant workloads like machine learning, artificial intelligence, genome analysis, graph analytics, databases, and video analytics are heavily reliant on vast volumes of data for efficient functioning. The current scenario reveals a notable data surplus, outpacing our processing capacities, evident in the exponential growth of data from astronomical observations to genome sequencing.\n\nRegrettably, the structure of modern computers is not optimized to handle copious amounts of data effectively. The sheer volume of application data puts a strain on the storage, communication, and computation capacities of present-day machines, posing a significant performance, and energy bottleneck, impacting system stability, and security. For instance, the advancement of genome sequencing technologies, such as nanopore sequencing, is hindered by the efficiency of processing the immense genomic data, limiting the potential of these technologies.\n\nOne of the primary reasons data overwhelms contemporary machines is the prevalent processor-centric design paradigm, and the subsequent execution model, of modern computing systems.

        "Here's a restructured and more coherent version of the text:\n\n# Introduction to Lightweight Cryptography and LED Cipher\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nOver the past few years, lightweight cryptography has seen increasing demand due to the proliferation of highly constrained devices such as RFID tags, wireless network sensors, and small internet-enabled applications with limited computing power and implementation area. A major challenge in this field has been improving encryption efficiency while maintaining system security, spurring significant research efforts.\n\nSeveral lightweight block ciphers have been developed to address these challenges, including SIMON, PRINCE, and TWINE. Among these, LED (proposed by Guo et al. at CHES 2011) achieves the smallest area footprint through its compact hardware implementation compared to block ciphers with similar parameters.\n\n## LED Cipher Architecture\n\nLED supports three key lengths: 64-bit, 80-bit, and 128-bit. Unlike AES, LED employs a simplified key scheduling procedure, initializing the round key at the beginning and using it repeatedly in each round. For 128-bit keys, the sub-key is divided into two parts and used alternately in each round.\n\nThe cipher's structure consists of 8-12 steps (depending on key length), with each step comprising four rounds of encryption operations:\n1. AddConstant\n2. SubCells\n3. ShiftRows\n4. MixColumnSerial\n\nLED utilizes the Sbox from PRESENT, which is commonly used in many lightweight cryptographic ciphers.\n\n## Security Challenges and Side Channel Attacks\n\nAlthough modern block cipher algorithms like LED are secure against cryptanalysis, their implementations can leak information about sensitive parameters, making them vulnerable to Side Channel Attacks (SCA). SCAs compromise cryptosystems by exploiting information leaked through:\n- Power consumption\n- Electromagnetic radiation\n- Execution delay\n\nDifferential Power Analysis (DPA) is a popular SCA scheme that combines information across multiple power measurements with different known inputs.\n\n## Countermeasures and Threshold Implementation\n\nWhile masking is a widely implemented countermeasure to SCA, hardware implementations with masking can still be vulnerable to DPA due to glitches and require fresh random values after every nonlinear operation.",
        "The breadth and depth of academic research conducted in the United States today are heavily reliant on federal funding. According to the National Science Foundation's annual Higher Education Research and Development Survey, total higher education R&D expenditures reached $86.4 billion for the 2020 fiscal year, with over $46 billion originating from the federal government [1]. Specifically, in the field of academic biomedical research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded research grants exceeding $29 billion during the same fiscal year [2]. Notably, a pivotal study highlighting racial disparities in research funding, conducted in 2011, focused on the NIH [3]. Subsequent studies have further contributed to the national dialogue using NIH proposal data [4] [5] [6] [7] [8].\n\nThe NIH stands as the primary and most influential funder of academic biomedical research in the United States. Research awards from the NIH, particularly through mechanisms like R01 grants, significantly impact promotion decisions and the sustainability of research programs. The substantial size and duration of these awards allow researchers to dedicate more time to research and less to grant-writing. Academic institutions highly value NIH funding due to its higher indirect cost rates compared to non-federal funding, and its role in assessing Medical School research programs in external rankings. For example, in the evaluation of Medical Schools for the \"Best Medical Schools for Research\" rankings by US News & World Report, a weight of 0.4 out of 1.0 is assigned to \"Research Activity\", a metric primarily based on federal funding [9], primarily NIH grants. While US News & World Report introduced a campus ethnic diversity index in 2020 [10], it does not influence the \"Best Medical Schools for Research\" rankings. As Ginther's research [3, 4] and recent acknowledgments and expansions by NIH researchers suggest [5, 6], a significant disparity persists in NIH funding rates between white principal investigators (PIs) and Black/African American (B/AA) PIs. This disparity underscores the inherent conflict between medical school rankings and faculty diversity.\n\nThe critical need for enhanced diversity in academic medicine and the biomedical workforce has been well-documented. While many academic institutions advocate for greater equity among faculty demographics, there is a lack of quantitative data to support specific interventions. Understandably, academic administrators and faculty leaders are cautious about implementing reforms that could inadvertently exacerbate existing inequities or create new systemic issues. Given the stakes involved, this policy paralysis can result in a cycle of calls for action followed by educational initiatives, which while crucial, are insufficient on their own to drive policy changes.\n\nAn actionable step forward is for academic administrators to leverage existing proposal databases at their institutions to assess diversity in academic research. Given the significance of extramural grant funding in academic research and its impact on promotion, tenure reviews, and departmental evaluations, it is logical to start any study on potential research inequities with an analysis of research grant proposals and awards. This approach not only enhances understanding of the complexities of the research funding system but also serves as a foundation for revising faculty development, research support procedures, performance metrics, and promotion and tenure review processes.\n\nDr. James Hildreth highlighted that at historically black colleges, there is a perceived \"intimidation factor\" in submitting proposals to the NIH and a belief that proposals may not be evaluated fairly [11]. This observation, combined with reported racial/ethnic discrepancies in award rates by the NIH, prompted an investigation into the relationship between race/ethnicity and submission behaviors for principal investigators at the University of Michigan Medical School (UMMS).",
        "In the digital age, industries such as virtual design, online marketplaces, product lifecycle workflows, AR/VR, and video games demand lifelike digital representations of real-world materials, known as digital twins. Acquiring these digital replicas is often a cumbersome and slow process, requiring costly machinery and multiple manual steps, which pose challenges to scalability, repeatability, and consistency. The fashion industry, in particular, faces a pressing need to digitize hundreds of textile samples swiftly\u2014 a feat current technology struggles to accomplish. \n\nOur method addresses this issue by digitizing a material using just a single scanned image as input. Moreover, it provides a pixel-wise uncertainty metric, denoted as \u03c3BRDF, calculated at test time through probabilistic sampling, which is beneficial for active learning. We present a plot comparing the average deviations of radiance in various renders against the ground truth (GT) for: 1) the distribution of probabilistic samples from a model trained with 100% of the data; 2) the deterministic output of that model; 3) the output from a model trained on 40% of the dataset selected via active learning using \u03c3BRDF; and 4) a model trained on 40% of the dataset, randomly sampled. The model shows higher uncertainty for the material at the bottom, resulting in more varied renders and greater deviation from the ground truth.\n\nIn this setting, casual capture systems for optical digitization offer a promising route for scalability. These systems utilize handheld devices (such as smartphones), varied illuminations, and learning-based priors to estimate a material's diffuse and specular reflection lobes. However, existing solutions have significant drawbacks, making them impractical for real-world digitization workflows. Generative approaches often produce unrealistic artifacts, and despite efforts to improve tileability and controllability, they remain slow, limited in resolution, and face challenges in generalization, needing one model per material class. Furthermore, the reliance on perceptual losses rather than pixel losses makes it difficult to ensure repeatability and consistency, essential for building a digital inventory (e.g., color swatches, prints).\n\nAlternatively, methods utilizing differentiable node graphs can overcome tileability and resolution issues but still suffer from problems associated with perceptual losses and category-specific training.\n\nIn this work, we introduce UMat, a practical, scalable, and reliable approach to digitizing textile materials using Spatially Varying Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (SVBRDFs). Typically, SVBRDFs include two reflection terms: a diffuse term, parameterized by an albedo image, and a specular term, characterized by normals, specularity, and roughness. Previous work attempts to estimate both components, which is a complex task, often yielding overly smooth outputs prone to artifacts. We demonstrate that accurate material digitization is possible with a single diffuse image as albedo and by estimating the specular components using a neural network. Our key insight is recognizing that the microgeometry of textiles accounts for most appearance variability, and a standard flatbed scanner can approximate the necessary diffuse illumination for most textiles.\n\nHowever, single-image material estimation is an inherently ill-posed problem, as reflectance properties are not directly observable from a single image. To address this, we propose a novel method to assess the model's confidence in its predictions at test time. By leveraging Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, we introduce an uncertainty metric calculated as the variance from sampling and evaluating multiple estimates for a single input in the render space. This confidence measure correlates with the digitization accuracy, helping to identify ambiguous inputs, out-of-distribution samples, or underrepresented classes. In addition to enhancing the trustworthiness of the capture process, our confidence quantification enables smarter dataset creation strategies, demonstrated through an active learning experiment.\n\nWe frame the estimation process as an Image-to-Image Translation problem, directly regressing roughness, specularity, and normals from a single input image. Our novel residual architecture features a single encoder with lightweight attention modules for improved global consistency and artifact reduction, specialized decoders for each target reflectance map, and a U-Net discriminator to enhance generalization.\n\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\n- A novel material capture system using flatbed scanners for high-resolution, scalable, and reliable digitization.",
        "Traditional image segmentation typically requires explicit target objects or predefined categories for pixel-level classification. However, a wide range of open-world applications, such as home robotics [18], self-driving vehicles [8], and augmented reality [15], demand that segmentation systems comprehend and interact with more complex human instructions.\n\nRecently, the advent of vision-language pretrained models, like CLIP [28], has transformed image segmentation from a closed-set approach\u2014where targets must belong to predefined categories\u2014to open-vocabulary segmentation, which allows adaptation to unseen categories. By unifying text and image into the same feature spaces, these models significantly reduce the cost of training on new datasets, thereby expanding the applicability of image segmentation tasks. However, the scope of open-vocabulary segmentation remains limited to the vocabulary or phrase level, lacking the capability to understand lengthy and complex text prompts.\n\nThe recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) [2-4, 6, 30], such as ChatGPT and LLama [30], has introduced new possibilities for defining segmentation targets. These state-of-the-art models demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities, enabling them to answer complex questions. To leverage the reasoning capability of LLMs in image segmentation, [16] introduces the concept of Reasoning Segmentation. This task requires the model to segment the target based on a question posed by a human, making it a more challenging endeavor due to the need for strong reasoning to identify the segmentation target, as well as the target's unclear granularity. Nevertheless, the application of Reasoning Segmentation is more expansive and dynamic.\n\nIn this work, we propose LLM-Seg, a two-stage method that combines vision-language models (VLMs) with vision foundation models. Our method, defined as two-stage, separates the processes of prompt understanding and image segmentation.",
        "Many network applications deliver flows with high Quality of Service (QoS), such as meeting end-to-end delay constraints. With the rise of mobile computing, multimedia applications are undergoing significant changes, altering user subscription patterns [1], [2]. For instance, Anvato [3] provides services like online video editing for content providers, ad insertion for advertisers, and caching and transcoding for diverse user devices. These specific requirements for video flows are typically fulfilled by traversing various network function middleboxes, a process known as a service function chain (SFC). Network Function Virtualization (NFV) [4] is an emerging technology for deploying network functions in software, offering multiple benefits. Notably, the popular streaming media company, Netflix [5], has adopted AWS to support their service chains through NFV.\n\nHowever, implementing network functions in software via virtualization technologies on general servers may lead to performance degradation compared to physical versions on dedicated hardware [6]. This degradation occurs because the operation of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) can be influenced by surges in computing load and hardware malfunctions. Consequently, deploying VNFs in different virtual machines (VMs) may result in varying delays and costs, affecting flow transmission expenses. For any given flow, the objective is to embed the required SFC with the minimum cost while satisfying the end-to-end delay constraint.\n\nFigure 1(a) illustrates a network, where each edge and node is assigned a two-tuple weight, (cost, delay). The weights on the edges pertain to flow transmission, while the weights on the nodes relate to the flow process. In this context, a VM without a deployed VNF incurs a processing cost and delay of zero. There are four available VMs (A, B, C, D) for deploying the SFC, (f1 \u2192 f2 \u2192 f3).\n\nIn this paper, the assumption is that a VM can host, at most, one VNF.",
        "Deep learning models have been instrumental in solving numerous real-world problems, even surpassing human-level performance in many tasks. However, these models typically require all training data to be available at the start of the training process. If this condition is not met, they are prone to catastrophic forgetting, where their performance on previously learned classes or tasks deteriorates. In contrast, humans have the ability to continually learn new data classes without losing previously acquired knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, deep learning models should adopt lifelong, continual, or incremental learning strategies.\n\nA significant challenge for deep learning models arises when all classes are not present in the training set. If the test set includes classes not seen during training, the model's performance declines markedly, leading to the zero-shot learning problem. This issue becomes even more daunting when combined with the incremental learning problem. In this paper, we address the task incremental learning problem in both zero-shot and non-zero-shot settings.\n\nThe task incremental learning problem involves training a model on one task at a time, with each task comprising a distinct set of non-overlapping classes. When a new task is introduced for training, the data from previous tasks is no longer accessible, causing the model to forget prior knowledge if trained only on the new task. Thus, the model must preserve the knowledge of older tasks while learning new ones. The task incremental generalized zero-shot learning problem extends this by involving classes that are unseen during training, akin to the zero-shot learning scenario. Here, the model's goal is to accurately recognize both seen and unseen classes across all trained tasks.\n\nIn our research, we conduct various experiments on the task incremental learning problem in both zero-shot and non-zero-shot contexts to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\nFinite element methods (FEM) are extensively used to simulate real-world physical phenomena [1], [2]. In FEM, the mathematical equations associated with the physics are reformulated with a variational formulation which is then discretized. This discretization is performed on a mesh, and the quality of the mesh elements directly impacts the approximated solution. Several techniques exist to ensure high quality of the approximated solution, including Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) [3], stabilized finite elements [4], bubble elements [6], and infinite elements [7], [8].\n\nThe FEM solution is obtained by solving a linear system of equations, whose size is proportional to the number of discretization points composing the mesh. This represents a significant part of the computational time. The high time cost of generating the FEM solution makes it tedious for running thousands of simulations by varying the input parameters for optimization applications and finding the best input parameter set. This is particularly challenging in metal forging process design.\n\nIn this paper, we explore deep learning models as an alternative to FEM for metal forging process design. Neural Networks [25] are efficient at learning patterns in data and have been widely used in various applications including image learning, speech recognition, and graph learning, where classical learning is difficult due to data complexity. The motivation behind using a deep learning surrogate model is to create a hybrid approach in which FEM is only used to generate high-resolution results in a reduced parametric space.\n\nWe created a Graph Neural Network-based deep learning model that takes mesh objects in the form of a graph and input parameters as the graph features. The choice of Graph Neural Network [19] is based on the property of graphs [20], which share the same permutation invariance property between meshes and point-cloud objects. We train the model on FEM-generated simulations to minimize the Mean Squared Error loss between predictions and actual graphs for all training simulations, then test the model's performance on test simulations. The proposed Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, once trained, can generate output data for a set of inputs in less than 500 milliseconds, compared to 110 minutes using FEM\u2014a 99.9% reduction in processing time.",
        "Robots are becoming increasingly common in everyday life, automating tasks for both individuals and companies. As the diversity of robots expands, tools to aid and speed up the design process are becoming more relevant. Designing a robot by hand is a challenging and time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. To expedite this process, engineers can offload some of the design work to computers, allowing them to select from various computer-generated designs and then tailor these designs to meet specific requirements.\n\nIn this paper, we explore how a variety of initial designs can be generated for linkage-based robots. We focus on the use of evolutionary algorithms, which have a long-standing history in the field of evolutionary robotics for optimizing robot morphology and control. A particularly interesting subclass of these algorithms, known as quality-diversity algorithms, optimizes for both diversity and novelty along with performance, often preserving a repertoire of solutions. These algorithms, such as MAP-Elites (Multidimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites) and its extensions like SAIL, have been employed in the evolution of modular robots and as suggestion generators for prototyping in various design tasks. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate MAP-Elites as a design suggestion tool within an iterative prototyping process for physical robots.\n\nTo facilitate quick design iterations on physical robots, we have chosen mechanical linkage-based robots as our platform. Mechanical linkages serve as an appropriate test-bed because new linkages can be rapidly created by rearranging beams without altering the robot's chassis. This concept is well-established, with a history spanning over a century. Various optimization algorithms have been used to create linkages that follow specific paths, primarily by optimizing beam lengths within a given configuration. Mechanical linkages have been applied in numerous industrial contexts, including robotics for locomotion, due to their ability to function with fewer motors, making them lighter and more energy-efficient. However, they also present constraints, as the path of the legs is typically fixed unless self-modifying features are incorporated.\n\nWe tested three evolutionary approaches for generating mechanical linkages for our robot: a standard evolutionary algorithm, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), and the quality-diversity approach MAP-Elites.",
        "Persuasion, a pervasive element of human interaction, aims to alter beliefs, positions, or opinions.  Its mechanisms are extensively studied across the social sciences (Cialdini, 2001; Crano and Prislin, 2006; Keynes, 2010), informing strategies in diverse fields like public health (Farrelly et al., 2009; Pirkis et al., 2017; Young et al., 2018), marketing (Danciu, 2014; Funkhouser and Parker, 1999), and politics (Markov\u00e1, 2008; Yu et al., 2019). The advent of social media has amplified these efforts through microtargeting\u2014tailoring messages to specific individuals or groups (Kreuter et al., 1999; Teeny et al., 2020).  While proven effective (Ali et al., 2021; Latimer et al., 2005; Matz et al., 2017), microtargeting has faced scalability challenges due to the costs associated with individual profiling and message crafting.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Claude (Anthropic, 2023), and Gemini (Gemini Team, 2023) may overcome these limitations.  These models, trained on vast textual data, mimic human language and reasoning with remarkable fluency and versatility, often exhibiting superhuman performance in various tasks (Bubeck et al., 2023).  This power raises concerns about their potential for manipulation, misinformation, and exacerbating political polarization (Bontcheva et al., 2024; Burtell and Woodside, 2023; Hendrycks et al., 2023; Weidinger et al., 2022).  A key concern is the potential for cheap and easy personalization, leveraging LLMs' ability to condition generated text on personal attributes and psychological profiles (Bommasani et al., 2021).  This is particularly relevant given LLMs' capacity to infer these attributes from publicly available digital traces like social media posts (Christian et al., 2021; Kosinski et al., 2013; Park et al., 2015; Peters and Matz, 2023; Schwartz et al., 2013; Segalin et al., 2017; Staab et al., 2024; Youyou et al., 2015) and other online activities (Stachl et al., 2021).  Furthermore, the increasing difficulty in distinguishing AI-generated from human-written content enhances LLMs' credibility and persuasive potential (Clark et al., 2021; Jakesch et al., 2023; Kreps et al., 2022; Spitale et al., 2023).\n\nExisting research indicates LLMs can generate persuasive content comparable to, or even exceeding, human-written messages (Bai et al., 2023; Karinshak et al., 2023; Palmer and Spirling, 2023).  Studies on personalized persuasion via LLMs have yielded promising but not unanimous results (Hackenburg and Margetts, 2023; Matz et al., 2023; Simchon et al., 2024). However, direct conversational persuasion by LLMs remains under-explored.  Given the conversational design of commercial LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini (Gertner, 2023), this area warrants further investigation.\n\nOur pre-registered study (https://aspredicted.org/DCC NTP) addresses this gap by analyzing AI-driven persuasion in controlled debates. Participants engaged in multiple-round debates on randomly assigned topics and stances, paired with either an AI or human opponent.  We also introduced a personalized condition where opponents accessed anonymized participant information. By measuring pre- and post-debate agreement, we compared the persuasive impact of different treatments.  This setup allows direct comparison of human and LLM persuasive abilities in real-time conversations, benchmarking LLM performance and their capacity to exploit personal data.\n\nWith 150 debates per treatment condition (N = 820 unique human players), we found personalized GPT-4 had the strongest effect, increasing the odds of higher post-debate agreement by 81.7% ([+26.3%, +161.4%], p < 0.01) compared to human-human debates.  Non-personalized GPT-4 also outperformed humans (+21.3%), but non-significantly (p = 0.31).  Human opponents with personalization showed a non-significant trend towards increased agreement radicalization (p = 0.38).  These results highlight LLMs' superior ability to leverage personal information for persuasive tailoring.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, with improved clarity, flow, and academic style:\n\n# Social Network Communities: A Data-Driven Analysis\n\nSocial networks represent the next evolution of websites, commanding significant user attention in today's digital landscape. These platforms operate by forming online communities, each attracting internet users with specific characteristics. Social networks, a distinct category of social media, have revolutionized communication and content sharing through the internet [1].\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, cluster analysis is defined as \"a statistical classification method with quantitative comparison of several properties, for discovering whether members of a population belong to different groups\" [2]. The fundamental purpose of clustering is to categorize samples (such as people or events) into groups where intra-cluster relationships are strong and inter-cluster relationships are weak [3].\n\nIn social networks, communities exhibit dense and complex internal relationships compared to their external connections. These communities provide valuable insights into:\n- User relationship patterns\n- Data transmission methods\n- User distribution across networks\n\nIndeed, communities form the cornerstone of these networks.\n\nCommunity detection in social networks has become crucial across diverse research fields. The primary objective is to group individuals with maximum similarity within communities. In other words, people within the same community are \"closer\" to each other than to members of different communities, with this proximity determined by various parameters.\n\nIn major social networks like Facebook and Twitter, communities manifest as groups of frequently interacting users. The volume of data exchanged between community members typically exceeds interactions with external users significantly. While network topology indicates whether direct connections exist between users, it doesn't reveal the intensity or frequency of their interactions. Notably, it doesn't indicate preferred paths for data flow [4]. Consequently, the volume of exchanged data serves as a valuable parameter for community detection.\n\nWhile numerous studies focus on temporal or static networks, this analysis examines users' online interactions across different time intervals. When messages are exchanged between nodes, an edge forms between them, with the relationship strengthening as message frequency increases. The relationship intensifies with higher message exchange rates and weakens with decreased activity.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows:\n- Section 2: Literature Review\n- Section 3: Proposed Methodology\n- Section 4: Evaluation Criteria\n- Section 5: Results and Analysis\n- Section 6: Conclusions and Future Work",
        "Scene text recognition (STR), the task of reading text from natural images, is a fundamental challenge in computer vision [15, 31, 32, 42, 46]. Early methods treated STR as a symbol classification problem [19, 31], but these struggled with images containing visual complexities like occlusion and noise. Recognizing that scene text embodies both visual and linguistic information, recent approaches, inspired by Natural Language Processing (NLP) [5, 23], incorporate linguistic context to improve recognition [28, 45, 46, 47].  These methods typically employ a two-step architecture (Fig. 1, top left), with a vision model processing visual features and a separate language model (RNN [32], CNN [7], or Transformer [45]) capturing character relationships.\n\nHowever, this two-step approach suffers from two key limitations: high computational cost, especially with longer words due to the language model's complexity (linear growth for RNN/CNN, quadratic for Transformer; Fig. 1), exacerbated by bi-directional architectures [32, 38, 45]; and the difficulty of effectively fusing the visual and linguistic information from two separate modules [7, 46].  We argue that these limitations stem from the vision model's lack of linguistic awareness; it focuses solely on visual texture [45].\n\nInspired by the human ability to acquire language [11, 21], we propose a novel approach (Fig. 1, bottom) where the vision model learns linguistic context directly (Fig. 5).  During training, the vision model is guided to reason about occluded characters, effectively integrating linguistic information within the visual processing stage.  In testing, this enables the model to adaptively leverage linguistic cues to enhance visual features, particularly in challenging scenarios like occlusion or noise, effectively supplementing and clarifying visual cues. To our knowledge, this is the first STR method to imbue the vision model with linguistic understanding.",
        "Text recognition, the process of transcribing visual information into text, is a critical technology bridging vision and language.  Its applications are diverse, ranging from visual search to document digitization.\n\nDespite recent advancements in text recognition, challenges persist, particularly in recognizing fine-grained text categories with variations in fonts and colors.  This difficulty is compounded by the limited availability of labeled real-world data.  While synthetic data has been employed in previous studies (e.g., [12, 20, 36, 44, 45, 60]) with some success, the performance gap between synthetic and real-world data remains a significant hurdle.\n\nTo mitigate the reliance on labeled real-world data, researchers have explored pre-training techniques, broadly categorized into two approaches: strengthening visual representations using unlabeled real images and incorporating language priors with a language model.  Some studies (e.g., [32, 58]) have leveraged contrastive learning and masked image modeling with large unlabeled image datasets to enhance visual representations.  Others (e.g., [12, 41]) have utilized pre-trained language models to guide or correct recognition model predictions.  While these methods have shown promise by incorporating visual or linguistic priors, they suffer from two key limitations. First, they often focus exclusively on either visual or linguistic knowledge, neglecting the inherent interplay of both within text images. This narrow focus can lead to reduced accuracy. Second, some previous approaches (e.g., [12, 41]) introduce language priors through a detached language model, preventing gradient flow between the recognition and language models and potentially hindering optimal performance.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel approach that leverages both visual and linguistic priors through pre-training to enhance text recognition performance.  We unify vision and language pre-training within a classical encoder-decoder framework.  Specifically, we pre-train the feature encoder on a large set of unlabeled real text images using masked image modeling, enabling the extraction of richer visual representations through self-supervision.  Concurrently, we directly pre-train the sequence decoder to improve its language modeling capabilities.\n\nTo achieve this unified pre-training, we first transform a text corpus into synthetic text images, aligning data modalities.  Then, we employ a novel masked image-language modeling technique to learn linguistic representations.",
        "Graph-based fraud detection methods, also known as graph anomaly detection methods, involve representing objects to be classified as fraud or benign as nodes and establishing connections between them. In the YelpChi benchmark dataset, for instance, reviews are the nodes and edges are formed based on whether the reviews were authored by the same user, written in the same month, or had the same star rating, with each factor considered a distinct relation.\n\nSeveral recently developed fraud detection techniques focus on differentiating relationships when calculating node representations. For example, CARE-GNN incorporates a relation-aware neighbor aggregator, BWGNN employs a propagation process for each relation, and FRAUDRE learns a fraud-aware graph convolution model specific to each relation. These relation-aware methods have demonstrated better performance compared to approaches that treat all edges equally and ignore relations.\n\nThe proposed DRAG, a Dynamic Relation-Attentive Graph neural network, decomposes the original graph based on relations to learn a node representation for each relation, as well as a self-transformation, resulting in multiple representations for each node. DRAG incorporates a self-loop, used in self-transformation, as an additional relation. At each layer, the model aggregates the multiple representations for each node, applying different learnable attention weights for the relations, and the final representation is computed by aggregating representations across different layers, taking into account not only the last layer, but also intermediate layers, to capture a holistic view.",
        "Humans naturally perceive various sounds and determine their origins using both their visual sense (eyes) and auditory sense (ears) [12]. The task of sound source localization aims to replicate human abilities by linking auditory cues with visual information to identify objects producing sounds. This property makes sound source localization relevant to numerous real-world applications, including unmanned aerial vehicles [14, 30], robotics [20, 28], and speaker source localization [6, 31].\n\nThe sound source localization task can be categorized into two groups: single sound source localization and multi-sound source localization. Single sound source localization [8, 11, 21, 22, 25, 32-36, 38, 39, 41, 44, 48] focuses on finding a single source within a scene by leveraging crossmodal correlations [32, 40] between audio and visual cues. Various methods have been developed for effective single sound source localization, such as hard positive mining [8, 33], iterative learning [21], and spatial integration [41]. However, these methods are limited to locating a single sound source, which can be challenging in environments with multiple mixed sounds.\n\nTo address this challenge, several multi-sound source localization methods [16, 17, 26, 27] have been introduced. Multi-sound source localization aims to separate and pinpoint individual sources from complex mixtures. However, existing methods often require prior knowledge of the number of objects to be separated, which can limit their applicability in practical scenarios.\n\nIn response to these limitations, we present a novel method for multi-sound source localization that can identify multiple sound sources without prior knowledge of the number of sources. Our method utilizes an Iterative Object Identification (IOI) module that automates object separation by recognizing sound-making objects iteratively until all relevant objects are identified.\n\nThe IOI module follows a process of identifying foreground objects iteratively and merging regions belonging to the same object using an Object Similarity-aware Clustering (OSC) loss. This loss guides the module to combine regions of the same object while distinguishing between different objects and backgrounds. As a result, our framework can accurately locate sound-making objects and differentiate between multiple sound sources without relying on prior source knowledge, outperforming existing methods in sound source localization performance.\n\nKey contributions of our study include:\n- Introducing the Iterative Object Identification (IOI) module for adaptively localizing multiple sound sources without prior source knowledge, a novel approach in multi-sound source localization.\n- Proposing the Object Similarity-aware Clustering (OSC) loss to guide the merging of regions belonging to the same object while distinguishing between different objects and backgrounds.\n- Demonstrating the effectiveness of our method on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets for both single and multi-source sound localization through experimental results.",
        "Here's the restructured text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\nDigital steganography represents a modern branch of information security that addresses the critical challenge of secure data transmission. While both steganography and cryptography aim to protect information during transmission, their approaches differ fundamentally. Cryptography alters the information to make it unreadable, whereas steganography creates covert communication channels by embedding messages within digital objects. Recent years have witnessed active development and investigation of various steganographic algorithms [1, 2].\n\nDigital images serve as ideal carriers for steganographic purposes, owing to their widespread use and ability to transmit secret information without arousing suspicion. Among digital image formats, JPEG is particularly significant due to its prevalence in network storage and transmission. This research specifically explores information hiding techniques within JPEG images.",
        "Conformal prediction is a versatile and simple method that provides a confidence region on predicted objects based on past observations. The main idea involves hypothesis testing between two scenarios where the unknown response is compared to a replacement candidate. The conformal prediction set comprises candidates whose tests are not rejected, and a p-value function is constructed based on prediction scores/errors and rank statistics. The key assumption is the invariance of the predictive model and the joint probability distribution, leading to a valid confidence set.\n\nThis method guarantees coverage without additional distribution assumptions and is valid for any finite sample size. It has been applied in various areas such as active learning, anomaly detection, and robust optimization. Due to its flexibility and ease of deployment, there is a growing interest in conformal prediction techniques for complex problems where classical approaches may be limited. The computation of conformal prediction sets is essential, and leveraging algorithmic stability can help in bounding the model's variation and providing tight confidence estimations efficiently and without the need for data splitting.\n\nIn a regression setting with a potentially infinite set of candidates, the computation of conformal prediction sets becomes infeasible without additional structural assumptions. The recommendation is to use less efficient data splitting methods to address the computational challenges. By incorporating algorithmic stability, the method overcomes the bottleneck of model readjustment and offers a single model fit without the need for data splitting, ensuring computational and statistical efficiency.\n\nNotation is used to define the dataset, input feature matrix, and the rank of the order statistics. The approach of leveraging algorithmic stability and the invariance of the predictive model and the joint probability distribution enhances the efficiency and validity of the conformal prediction method, making it a valuable tool in the realm of machine learning and prediction.",
        "The rapid advancement of blockchain technology and communication methods has sparked significant interest in the Metaverse, hailed as the next-generation Internet paradigm [1] - [3]. Governments and companies worldwide are gearing up for the impending Metaverse era, with initiatives such as South Korea integrating Metaverse-based lessons, Facebook's transformation into a Metaverse-focused entity, now known as Meta, and Tencent's investment in the AR platform \"Avakin Life\" [4] - [6].\n\nA pressing challenge in the Metaverse is bridging the gap between the virtual realm and reality through extended reality (XR), encompassing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) [7] - [10]. Current research primarily targets enhancing communication and computation for VR to deliver users an immersive experience [11], [12]. However, mobile VR services demand exceptionally high data rates, posing challenges even in the 5G landscape. Moreover, users grapple with the weighty nature of existing VR devices, necessitating a solution.\n\nMobile augmented reality (MAR) emerges as a viable alternative to VR and a crucial component of the Metaverse [13] - [16]. Unlike VR, MAR blends reality with the virtual world, curtailing communication and computational expenses [17] - [19]. AR devices also excel in weight compared to VR gadgets, offering enhanced comfort and safety as wearable technology. AR boasts unique benefits in various sectors like navigation, healthcare, tourism, shopping, and education, requiring interaction with the physical world [20] - [22].\n\nWhile AR necessitates lower data rates than VR, efficient communication resource allocation remains crucial due to the vast number of users and devices linked to the Metaverse server. To enhance communication resource efficiency and quality of service (QoS), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for VR/AR services have garnered significant attention [23] - [29]. Various studies have proposed innovative approaches, such as an RL-based energy-efficient MEC framework for AR services and utilizing deep RL for MAR services over 6G networks.\n\nThis paper introduces an AR-based Metaverse model featuring resolution control and a resource allocation algorithm. The proposed algorithm, addressing the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem, leverages an outer approximation (OA) algorithm to achieve the global optimum. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to maximize utility within communication resource constraints, outperforming conventional greedy algorithms.\n\nKey contributions of this study include:\n- Proposal of an MAR-based Metaverse model for reality-centric applications.\n- Introduction of a resolution control and resource allocation optimization problem for Metaverse MAR services, solved using an OA algorithm.\n- Implementation of simulation to compare the proposed algorithm against a benchmark greedy algorithm under diverse parameter settings, highlighting the efficacy of the proposed Metaverse MAR service model.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section II outlines the proposed system model, Section III defines the problem and Section IV presents the solution approach. Section V showcases simulation results and Section VI concludes the paper.",
        "The remarkable performance of Transformers across diverse applications, from computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) to natural language processing (OpenAI, 2023), has spurred significant interest in understanding their underlying learning mechanisms.  While Transformers consistently outperform domain-specific models like CNNs, GNNs, and RNNs/LSTMs (Vaswani et al., 2017), the effectiveness of their fundamental building block \u2013 the self-attention and two-layer MLP combination \u2013 remains an open question: How does this basic block facilitate effective learning?\n\nUnraveling the learning dynamics of multi-layer Transformers presents a significant challenge due to their inherent complexity and nonlinearity.  Existing research primarily focuses on simplified scenarios, such as single-layer Transformers (Li et al., 2023a; Tarzanagh et al., 2023b) with constraints like fixed MLP layers (Tarzanagh et al., 2023a), linear activation functions (Tian et al., 2023), or localized gradient steps at initialization (Bietti et al., 2023; Oymak et al., 2023).\n\nThis paper introduces JoMA (Joint MLP/Attention Integral), a novel framework analyzing the joint dynamics of self-attention and MLP layers.  JoMA reveals a nuanced behavior of self-attention: initially, it exhibits sparsity, focusing on frequently co-occurring tokens, similar to observations in linear models (Tian et al., 2023). Subsequently, with nonlinear activation, attention becomes denser, progressively incorporating tokens with less frequent co-occurrence. This suggests an evolving inductive bias during training, progressing from salient to less salient features.\n\nA natural follow-up question is why this learning pattern is advantageous. While seemingly inconsequential in single-layer settings, this dynamic plays a crucial role in multi-layer Transformers. We illustrate this using a hierarchical tree generative model for input tokens, where higher-level latent variables (LVs) generate lower-level ones, culminating in the observed tokens.  Tokens originating from lower-level LVs exhibit frequent co-occurrence, captured initially as salient features by the attention mechanism.  This triggers the learning of these token combinations within the MLP's hidden nodes, leading to self-attention grouping at progressively higher levels of the hierarchy. Consequently, less salient co-occurrences are explained by higher-level hierarchical relationships, preventing their misinterpretation as spurious correlations at lower levels, a pitfall effectively mitigated by the attention mechanism. This theoretical finding is corroborated by observations in both pre-trained models like OPT/Pythia and models trained from scratch on datasets like Wikitext2 and Wikitext103.\n\nJoMA surpasses existing frameworks like Scan&Snap (Tian et al., 2023) by incorporating key elements like residual connections and MLP nonlinearity, analyzing the joint training of MLP and self-attention, and providing a qualitative explanation for multi-layer Transformer dynamics. Notably, JoMA converges to Scan&Snap's sparse attention behavior in the specific case of linear activation.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Named Entity Recognition for Person Names: A Study in Model Performance Across Cultural Diversity\n\n## Introduction\n\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task in which a computer finds and labels elements in a piece of text that fall into a set of predetermined categories, such as person names, locations, medical terminology, and organization names. This task is an integral part of information extraction from unstructured text.\n\n*Note: Throughout this paper, unless otherwise specified, the word \"names\" will only be used to refer to person names.*\n\nThis paper focuses specifically on person name recognition. The research experiments with model input and training data composition to develop a model that increases true positives when extracting names from text. While this work has broad applications, it was developed specifically for Businessolver's virtual benefits agent, Sofia, to match extracted names with user information on file, such as names of dependents and beneficiaries. Successful name extraction enables the system to process user requests like checking dependent benefits or viewing beneficiary designations.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nA shared task by Derczynski et al. (2017) evaluated NER model performance on rare and emerging entities using a curated test dataset. The study revealed that while models handled common English names well, they struggled with names from other languages. The top-performing model achieved an F1 score of only 41.86, highlighting the challenge of identifying rare or novel entities compared to high-frequency entities.\n\nGiven that Sofia's user base primarily resides in the culturally diverse United States, this research aims to create a model that performs consistently across names from various cultural backgrounds, avoiding performance bias between common and rare names. The hypothesis is that incorporating character-level input could reduce the impact of out-of-vocabulary names not present in the training data.\n\n## Existing Approaches\n\nAccording to Yadav and Bethard (2018), high-performing NER models fall into four categories:\n1. Knowledge-based systems\n2. Unsupervised and bootstrapped systems\n3. Feature-engineered supervised systems\n4. Feature-inferring neural network systems\n\nRecent studies have shown promising results with combined architectures:\n- Chiu and Nichols (2016) achieved the best F-score for English using an RNN with character and word-level architecture\n- Yadav et al. (2018) obtained the best F-scores for Spanish, Dutch, and German using an RNN with character, word, and affix architecture\n- In the DrugNER shared task, Yadav et al.'s word and character-level architecture outperformed Chalapathy et al.'s (2016) word-level-only approach\n\n## Proposed Approach\n\nThis research will compare models trained on combined word and character input against those trained solely on word input. Character-level input may enable the model to learn sub-word patterns that help identify similarities between names (e.g., \"Ashleigh\"/\"Ashley\", \"Alex\"/\"Alexis\", or \"Drew\"/\"Andrew\").",
        "Today's scientific research applications produce volumes of data too large to be stored, transferred, and analyzed efficiently because of limited storage space and potential bottlenecks in I/O systems. Cosmological simulations, for example, may generate more than 20 PB of data when simulating 1 trillion particles over hundreds of snapshots per run. Climate simulations, such as the Community Earth Simulation Model (CESM), may produce hundreds of terabytes of data for each run.\n\nEffective data compression methods have been studied extensively. Most existing lossy compressors consider the error bound preeminent and endeavor to improve the compression ratio and performance as much as possible subject to the error bound. Since the major scientific floating-point datasets are composed of floating-point values, however, lossless compressors cannot effectively compress such datasets because of high entropy of the mantissa bits. Therefore, error-bounded lossy compressors have been widely studied because they not only significantly reduce the data size but also prevent data distortion according to a user's specified error bound.\n\nHowever, many scientific application users have requirements for the compression ratio. These users desire to perform fixed-ratio lossy compression, compressing data based on the required compression ratio instead of strictly respecting the user's error bound. The lossy compressor needs to adjust the error bound to respect the target user-specified compression ratio while minimizing data distortion. Users can provide additional constraints regarding data distortion to guarantee the validity of the results from reconstructed data.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a generic, efficient fixed-ratio lossy compression framework, FRaZ, that accurately determines the error settings for various error-controlled lossy compressors based on the target compression ratio with a specific scientific floating-point dataset. Our design involves two critical optimization strategies: utilizing a global optimum searching method to determine the most appropriate error setting and optimizing the parameter searching performance through parallelization.\n\nConstructing a generic, high-fidelity framework for fixed-ratio lossy compression poses research challenges, such as the non-monotonic relationship between error bounds and compression ratios and the need to treat the compression algorithm as a black box to allow for future inclusion of various compressors. We evaluate our framework based on state-of-the-art lossy compressors using real-world scientific floating-point datasets and show accurate error setting determination with minimal time overhead in parallel performance evaluation.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the background and user requirements on compression ratios, Section III compares our work with related research, Section IV presents the problem formulation, Section V describes our design and optimization strategies, Section VI presents the evaluation results, and Section VII concludes with future work considerations.",
        "Commercial and civil unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) applications are expected to experience significant growth in the global market. According to SESAR, the European drone market is projected to surpass C10 billion annually by 2035 and exceed C15 billion annually by 2050 [SESAR JU, 2016]. It is anticipated that the most market value will come from operations of small UAS (sUAS) and within the very-low-level airspace (VLL), based on the characteristics of the missions and application fields. This growth trend will bring about increased traffic density and new challenges related to safety, reliability, and efficiency. Therefore, the development and implementation of conflict management systems are seen as crucial for the integration of UAS into civil airspace.\n\nA notable effort in this regard is the initiative by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the USA to establish a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system. This system aims to enable numerous UAS to operate at low altitudes alongside other airspace users [Barrado et al., 2020]. In Europe, similar progress is being made with the development of a UTM concept known as U-space, which is designed to provide a range of services to accommodate current and future traffic in the VLL airspace [Prevot et al., 2016]. China and Japan are also adopting similar approaches [Zhang, 2018].\n\nUnder the UTM services, UAS must possess the ability to avoid both static conflicts like buildings, terrain, and no-fly zones, and dynamic conflicts such as encounters with manned or unmanned aircraft. A pairwise conflict is defined as a breach of the en-route separation minima between two UAVs [ica]. To ensure conflict-free operations, UTM offers Conflict Detection and Resolution services, which consist of three safety layers based on the time-horizon (look-ahead time): Strategic and Tactical Conflict Mitigation and Collision Avoidance (CA) [ica][nas].\n\nThis study focuses on the tactical Conflict Resolution (CR) applicable for small UAS missions. This function is typically addressed in two ways: Self-separation and Collision Avoidance [nas] [Radanovic et al., 2019]. Self-separation involves a maneuver executed seconds before a potential breach of separation minima, aiming to prevent the need for Collision Avoidance activation. Collision Avoidance serves as a last-resort safety measure characterized by immediate and evasive maneuvers. Both functions fall under the umbrella term of Detect and Avoid capability [Consiglio et al., 2016, Johnson et al., 2017a].\n\nIn line with current advancements, a loss of separation minima is referred to as a loss of Well Clear (LoWC). While there is no standard definition of well clear (WC), two associated functions are Remain Well Clear (RWC) and Collision Avoidance (CA) [Manfredi et al., 2017]. RWC in terms of tactical CD&R is comparable to the self-separation function. The definition and computation of RWC thresholds remain areas of ongoing research, primarily conceptualized as a protection volume around UAS [Cook et al., 2017, Consiglio et al., 2019, Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2016], typically defined by distance-based thresholds.\n\nMoreover, the concept of a near-mid-air-collision (NMAC) represents the final safety volume. A distance smaller than NMAC signifies a severe loss of well clear that could potentially lead to a collision. This distance is typically determined based on the dimensions of the UAS and its navigation performance [Modi et al., 2016].\n\nWhile numerous existing works propose conflict resolution algorithms (see Section II for a detailed overview), many primarily focus on pairwise conflicts.",

These advancements have enabled the application of AI methods in diverse areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and more. However, with these advancements, concerns regarding the safety of AI systems have emerged, particularly as AI becomes integrated into safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles and tumor detection. Consequently, there is a growing need for suitable safety assurance approaches, especially in light of recent reviews that indicate both the frequency and severity of AI failures are expected to increase steadily.\n\nA crucial aspect of machine learning (ML) robustness is the estimation of the confidence associated with the output of a given ML model. Although many ML and AI systems are equipped with inherent uncertainty heuristics or probabilistic outputs that can be interpreted as confidence levels, these outputs alone are insufficient to confirm the model's trustworthiness. This is because the confidence measures are developed using the same data, making them susceptible to the same noise and biases as the model itself.\n\nA safety argument for a system with ML components should be tailored to the specific application and its context, comprising a diverse range of measures and assumptions. These include both development-time and runtime approaches. SafeML, as proposed in the literature, is a methodology designed to ensure the safety of ML models during runtime, particularly by verifying that the models are operating as intended. This is achieved by comparing the training and operational data of the ML model and determining whether the data are statistically similar enough to produce a reliable outcome.\n\nThis paper highlights the problems and limitations of the current implementation of statistical distance methods in SafeML and proposes approaches to address these issues.",
        "Food image classification is crucial for advancing food pattern tracking, nutritional and health analysis, and dietary monitoring. Despite the high accuracy of current food classification models on static datasets with fixed classes, they falter when faced with the dynamic and evolving nature of food habits. This dynamic necessitates that food image classification models are capable of adapting to and learning from continuously changing data. In response to this challenge, our work champions the adoption of continual learning, which is designed to incrementally process and learn from data streams, facilitating seamless adaptation.\n\nOur research focuses on addressing the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting within continual learning frameworks, aiming to enhance the robustness and adaptability of food image classification models in the face of ever-evolving data with the help of compression. This approach holds promising potential for deployment in on-device learning applications, such as food recognition mobile apps, which typically operate within environments under constrained memory and computation resources.\n\nIn this work, we mainly focus on class-incremental learning (CIL), where a model is trained on a sequence of tasks, with each task introducing new classes that were not present in previous tasks. Memory replay, a method that stores selected exemplars from previously seen classes in a memory buffer, is effective in mitigating catastrophic forgetting in CIL. Our objective is to design a continual food recognition system by extending memory replay-based approaches in CIL.\n\nThe central idea of our method is to leverage image compression techniques to increase the number of previously seen class data stored in the memory buffer. Compressing exemplars allows for a more balanced and diverse training set during each incremental learning step, mitigating the effects of catastrophic forgetting and enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new classes while retaining knowledge of previous ones.\n\nHowever, directly employing compressed images as exemplars introduces the challenge of domain shift in CIL, leading to a decline in accuracy for previously learned classes. To address this, we involve neural compression, which preserves more of the original image's characteristics during the compression process. Additionally, we use class activation maps (CAM) to preserve foreground semantic information and further mitigate the domain shift issue.\n\nThe main contributions of this work include a continual food recognition framework that incorporates a continually trained neural compressor and CAM-based background compression to enhance classification accuracy. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews prior works related to food image analysis, incremental learning, and image compression. Section 3 introduces our proposed method. Section 4 presents quantitative experimental results, and Section 5 discusses the conclusion and potential future works.",
        "Advancements in 3D measurement technology, such as passive stereo vision [1-4], the phase-shifting method [5], gray code [6], and other techniques [7, 8], have made the acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds more accessible. Consequently, efficiently processing these 3D point clouds has emerged as a significant challenge. Segmentation of 3D point clouds is often a crucial preprocessing step in various applications, including autonomous vehicles [9], human-robot interaction [10-12], robotic bin-picking [13-16], pose estimation [17-21], visual servoing [22, 23], and other forms of 3D point cloud processing [24-28].\n\nIn the robotics field, bin-picking scenarios have garnered considerable attention over the past decade. In these scenarios, numerous objects of the same category are often stacked together. The challenge in logistics warehouse bin-picking lies in the diversity of categories and unknown objects [29-31]. In contrast, industrial bin-picking scenes face difficulties in distinguishing identical objects and creating datasets. Currently, applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to 3D point cloud instance segmentation lags behind its practical application. The primary technical challenges include: 1) convolution kernels are better suited for structured information, whereas raw 3D point clouds are unstructured and unordered; 2) the availability of high-quality, large-scale 2D image datasets [32-34] has propelled deep learning applications in 2D images, but there are fewer datasets for 3D point clouds; and 3) instance segmentation of 3D point clouds using CNNs is time-consuming.\n\nRegarding key point 1, PointNet [35] was the first framework designed to process unstructured and unordered 3D point clouds. Unlike methods that convert 3D point cloud data into voxel grids [36, 37], PointNet employs multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn individual point features, using max-pooling to gather global information. This pioneering work has spurred further research, with several researchers incorporating PointNet's structure as their network backbone [38-40]. However, since PointNet processes each point independently, it captures less local information [38, 41]. To enhance local information learning in 3D point clouds, methods proposed in [42-48] have improved the network's ability to perceive local details by exploring adjacent points. Following our previous work [49], we use DGCNN [41] as our feature extractor due to its flexibility and robustness in processing point clouds with only coordinates.\n\nFor key point 2, well-known 3D point cloud datasets include indoor scene datasets like S3DIS [50] and SceneNN [51], driving scenario datasets such as the KITTI dataset [52] and Apollo-SouthBay dataset [53], and single object recognition datasets like ShapeNet [37]. For robotic bin-picking, creating a comprehensive training dataset of various industrial objects is a massive and challenging task, and no such dataset currently exists. Simulating training data offers a viable solution to the dataset shortage [54-58]. At this stage, we advocate training the network with synthetic data as a cost-effective and practical strategy. Our network, trained on synthetic data, demonstrates satisfactory results on real-world data.\n\nFor key point 3, the time-consuming nature of instance segmentation on 3D point clouds using CNNs arises from several factors. Instance segmentation involves locating different instances, even within the same class. As instances in a scene are unordered and their quantity unpredictable, using a fixed tensor to represent instance labels is impossible. Therefore, instance segmentation involves two methods: proposal-based, requiring an object detection module, and proposal-free, which does not. Proposal-based methods necessitate complex post-processing steps to handle numerous proposal regions and perform poorly in cases of strong occlusion. Most researchers prefer the proposal-free method for 3D point cloud instance segmentation [39, 40, 59-63]. This method typically performs semantic segmentation first, then distinguishes different instances through clustering or metric learning [39, 40, 59, 49]. Current clustering methods generate multiple candidate groups, which are then merged\u2014a highly time-consuming process. In contrast, our clustering algorithm directly generates instances based on the feature distance between an object's center point and the remaining points, significantly speeding up instance generation and avoiding a scenario where a point belongs to multiple instances simultaneously.\n\nThis paper introduces a fast point cloud clustering method for instance segmentation, named FPCC, comprising FPCC-Net and a rapid clustering algorithm based on FPCC-Net's output. FPCC-Net is a graph convolutional neural network capable of effectively segmenting 3D point clouds at the instance level without relying on manually annotated data. It maps all points to a discriminative feature embedding space, satisfying two conditions: 1) points of the same instance have similar features, and 2) points of different instances are widely separated in this space. Simultaneously, FPCC-Net identifies center points for each instance, which serve as reference points during the clustering process.",
        "Predicting age and gender has become a prominent field in deep learning, driven by the increasing volume of images uploaded online. While humans easily recognize each other and often make judgments about gender and ethnicity, accurately estimating age remains a challenge.  This difficulty is highlighted by the standard evaluation metric, mean absolute error (MAE). Studies show that humans have a MAE of 7.2-7.4 years when predicting the age of individuals over 15, meaning their predictions are off by this amount on average.  Can we develop automated systems that surpass human performance in this task?\n\nThe challenge stems from the complex factors influencing facial aging.  Beyond genetics, lifestyle, expressions, and environment play significant roles [1].  Consequently, individuals of the same age can appear vastly different. This inherent complexity is compounded by the scarcity of large, balanced, and accurately labeled datasets.  Existing datasets are often imbalanced, concentrating on the 20-75 age range [3]-[5] or exhibiting gender bias.  Using such biased data is detrimental, creating a distribution mismatch with real-world images during testing and leading to poor performance.\n\nDespite these challenges, the field holds immense potential, sparking growing interest due to its wide applicability in areas like human-computer interaction (HCI).  Potential applications span forensics, law enforcement [1], security control [1], and even integration with IoT devices. Imagine a restaurant dynamically adjusting its ambiance based on the estimated average age or gender of its patrons.\n\nThis paper explores these possibilities and is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background on previous work in this field and our motivations. Section 3 details the technical aspects of our project, divided into three subsections. Section 4 describes the evaluation metrics employed.  Section 5 presents our experiments and results, and Section 6 concludes with a summary and directions for future work.",
        "Dislocations, line defects in the crystal lattice, govern the plastic deformation of metals under most conditions. Consequently, discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD), a computational method simulating the motion and interaction of dislocation lines, has become invaluable for studying metal plasticity at the mesoscale.  In DDD, dislocation lines are discretized into segments connecting nodes, whose positions evolve over time through the integration of nodal velocities [1]. Node motion arises from the dislocations' response to the driving force at each node, a function of the local stress acting along the dislocation lines. Because all dislocation lines interact elastically, calculating nodal forces for time-integration is typically the most computationally expensive simulation stage. This burden is exacerbated by the intrinsic stiffness and highly nonlinear behavior of the system, stemming from the nature of dislocation interactions, which necessitates small timesteps for traditional time-integrators and limits the achievable physical timescale. Despite recent algorithmic advances [2], the computational cost of DDD simulations remains a significant challenge.\n\nHere, we present a novel DDD-GNN framework, replacing the computationally intensive time-integration procedure with a graph neural network (GNN) trained to predict nodal displacements directly from nodal configurations and applied loading.  GNNs are particularly well-suited for this task, as dislocation line configurations are inherently graph-like. Our model leverages the common DDD practice of partitioning elastic interactions into short- and long-range components. By bypassing explicit short-range force calculations, our framework offers the potential for significant simulation acceleration. This approach distinguishes itself from previous machine learning applications in DDD, which focused on accelerating individual interaction force calculations [3], characterizing dislocation microstructures [4], or predicting crystal plasticity through stress/strain curves [5, 6, 7].\n\nWe demonstrate our approach using the fundamental case of a dislocation line gliding through an obstacle array under an imposed load. This widely employed model represents an important dislocation dynamics scenario used to study various dislocation-obstacle bypass mechanisms [8\u201318] and is relevant for applications such as solid solution strengthening and precipitate/irradiation-induced hardening. Our DDD-GNN model is trained on ground-truth DDD data to predict nodal displacements (effective velocities) across a range of obstacle densities and strain rates.  We show that the trained GNN time-integrator, implemented within the DDD framework, accurately reproduces the local dislocation motion behavior and predicts long-term simulation trajectories, including the correct saturation flow stress under different loading regimes.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the DDD method and introduces our hybrid DDD-GNN approach. Section 3 presents the dislocation-obstacle glide model and the training data.  Results are presented in Section 4, followed by a discussion in Section 5.  Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.",
        "The design of numerous autonomous platforms is guided by the principle of modularity. A typical robot's autonomy stack, for instance, comprises separate modules for perception, planning, and control [24]. These modules often operate at different frequencies and levels of abstraction, despite the need for safe, real-time task execution with limited onboard computational resources.  Higher levels of abstraction generally enable faster decision-making. However, significant discrepancies in abstraction levels across modules can lead to unexpected and unsafe system behavior.  Choosing appropriate abstraction levels in robotics has remained largely an art. This work focuses on developing a quantitative, data-driven method to bridge the potential mismatch between trajectory planning and control modules.\n\nAlthough trajectory planning and control are extensively studied in robotics, challenges persist. Graph-search-based path planning algorithms can struggle to incorporate complex nonlinear system dynamics.  Similarly, real-time optimization-based trajectory generation methods typically employ simplified or reduced-order dynamics models. Conversely, low-level feedback control policies often rely on more accurate, detailed system dynamics for tracking reference trajectories generated by the aforementioned approaches. This layered approach, while conceptually appealing, is effective only when higher-layer outputs are compatible with lower-layer capabilities.\n\nThis paper focuses on the interplay between trajectory generation and feedback control.  Rather than imposing a layered architecture, we demonstrate its derivation through a suitable relaxation of a global nonlinear optimal control problem that jointly encodes both trajectory generation and feedback control. Critically, the resulting trajectory generation optimization problem becomes dynamics-aware through a tracking penalty regularizer, encoding the dynamic feasibility of a generated trajectory.  While this tracking penalty generally lacks a closed-form expression, we interpret it as a cost-to-go, learnable from system roll-outs using tools from machine learning for any feedback control policy. We evaluate our framework using unicycle and quadrotor control, comparing our approach to standard quadrotor trajectory generation methods in simulation.  Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our data-driven, dynamics-aware framework enables faster computation of accurately trackable trajectories in both simulation and hardware.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\n* Deriving a layered control architecture with a dynamics-aware trajectory generator (top layer) and a feedback controller (low layer).  Our trajectory generation problem is inherently dynamics-aware, incorporating a tracking penalty regularizer that encodes the low-layer controller's tracking ability.\n* Showing that the tracking penalty can be viewed as a system's cost-to-go, and thus learned from system rollouts.\n* Applying our data-driven, dynamics-aware trajectory generation framework to unicycle and quadrotor control problems.  We demonstrate that our approach generates aggressive yet easily trackable trajectories compared to standard methods for both systems.\n\nSection 3 formulates the dynamics-aware trajectory planning problem, using the unicycle and waypoint tracking problem as running examples. Section 4 presents a result showing how relaxing the underlying nonlinear control problem naturally leads to a trajectory optimization problem with a regularizer capturing the controller's tracking cost. We also describe our supervised learning approach for learning the cost-to-go function characterizing the feedback control layer's tracking ability.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# Deep Neural Networks and Explainable AI: A Technical Overview\n\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful machine learning models capable of learning complex patterns from data. However, their intricate nature makes it challenging to understand their decision-making process based solely on mathematical construction. Building upon the foundational Explainable AI (XAI) research of Virani et al. [1] (Figure 1), which effectively validates decision support through training data, we address the limitations of memory and computational requirements that hinder deployment on large datasets and edge devices. By leveraging Sparse Gaussian processes [2-5], we overcome these computational challenges while preserving accuracy and explainability. Our approach offers a computationally efficient XAI method that derives example-based justifications and uncertainty estimates applicable to any pre-trained DNN.\n\n## The Role of Explainable AI\n\nExplainable artificial intelligence tackles the black-box problem through multiple approaches:\n- Decomposing model construction for intuitive understanding\n- Supplementing models with decision-explanation tools\n- Implementing structured combinations of both methods\n\nXAI's ability to provide insight into AI decision-making processes enables humans to identify and address potential errors proactively. This capability makes it invaluable for mission-critical applications, such as:\n\n### Jet Engine Maintenance\n- Provides detailed reasoning for potential problems before failure occurs\n- Recommends preventive actions\n- Monitors engine performance for safety compliance\n\n### Airport Safety\n- Detects and explains potential ground hazards\n- Accelerates human understanding of security threats\n- Ensures safe aircraft movement during takeoff and landing\n\n## Core Approaches to XAI\n\nThe field's foundation rests on six primary seminal papers that explore three main approaches:\n\n### 1. Gradient-based Methods\nThese methods identify crucial input features for predictions by calculating loss function gradients relative to input features. Features with the largest gradients demonstrate the strongest influence on predictions [7].\n\n### 2. Text-based Explanations\nThis approach trains DNNs to generate explanatory text using attention mechanisms, allowing networks to focus on specific input features when making predictions [8].\n\n### 3. Metric Learning\nThis method trains DNNs to learn distance metrics for measuring feature similarity, enabling:\n- Identification of similar training samples for any test sample\n- Prediction generation based on outcomes from similar training samples [9]\n\n### Comparative Analysis\n\nEach approach offers distinct advantages and trade-offs:\n\n| Approach | Advantages | Challenges |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n| Gradient-based | Simple implementation | Raw results can be difficult to interpret |\n| Text-based | Highly informative | Requires complex language modeling |",
        "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various pattern recognition and computer vision applications. Recent studies indicate that when deep networks are trained on large-scale datasets, their features exhibit strong generalization performance across a broad range of datasets and computer vision tasks. However, a notable issue arises due to dataset bias: these networks tend to have high test error rates when there is a substantial difference in data distribution between the training and test sets. Fine-tuning offers a straightforward approach to mitigate feature bias in deep networks, but it demands a considerable amount of labeled data, which is often unavailable in many situations. Therefore, designing algorithms capable of transferring discriminative features from a labeled source domain to a related, unlabeled domain is both necessary and important.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, the concept of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has recently gained attention. UDA typically involves two related but distinct datasets: a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain. Both domains share the same category space and learning tasks. The primary objective of UDA is to transfer discriminative domain knowledge to address the learning task in the target domain. Notably, because the label information of the target domain is unknown, it can be challenging to ensure that the source and target domains share the same label space. This paper explores a specific UDA scenario called Partial UDA, where the target domain category is a subset of the source domain category.\n\nEarlier UDA methods were primarily based on shallow models, generally divided into instance-based and feature-based approaches. Instance-based adaptation methods reweigh samples in the source domain to better represent the target domain distribution, while feature-based methods aim to learn a shared and invariant feature space. However, due to the limited representation capacity of these models, their performance lags behind deep UDA approaches.\n\nIn recent years, with the advancement of deep neural networks, more deep network-based models have been developed to address UDA tasks. These methods are founded on the principle that domain discrepancies diminish in the deep feature space, allowing domain adaptation to be more effectively achieved by matching the deep features of the source and target domains. Let Z and Y denote deep features and labels, respectively. To project data from different domains into a shared deep feature space, existing methods often focus on marginal distribution alignment, reducing the discrepancy between the source domain's P(Z) and the target domain's P(Z). Common strategies include minimizing the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) or employing adversarial training. However, these methods overlook the conditional dependence between features and labels during feature space alignment, which can lead to negative transfer. In particular, in the Partial UDA task, aligning P(Z) across domains may result in target domain samples being incorrectly assigned to nonexistent categories. Consequently, marginal distribution alignment-based methods are ineffective for solving (Partial) UDA problems.\n\nAn effective strategy to overcome this issue involves learning a conditional domain-invariant feature space by aligning the conditional distributions, P(Z|Y) in both source and target domains. Based on this idea, some recent UDA methods aim to reduce the difference between P(Z|Y) by using class-specific MMD or conditional adversarial generation networks. However, class-specific MMD requires a substantial number of samples to estimate MMD in each category, posing challenges for application to deep models. Conditional adversarial generation networks may suffer from mode collapse and training instability. Moreover, conditional distribution alignment requires using target domain label information, making it crucial to extract discriminative information in the target domain to enhance pseudo-label accuracy. Some methods introduce additional entropy regularization to extract discriminant information, but this approach only considers single-sample discrimination, potentially causing model degradation. Effectively measuring the difference between two conditional distributions and extracting discrimination information from unlabeled data in deep models is key to aligning conditional distributions.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new conditional distribution alignment-based domain adaptation method called Deep Conditional Adaptation Network (DCAN). DCAN effectively aligns conditional distributions using Conditional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) and extracts discriminant information from both source and target domains. CMMD directly and efficiently measures the distance between two conditional distributions, allowing us to minimize CMMD loss and learn a conditional domain-invariant feature space where the classifier trained on the source domain can accurately classify target domain samples. Unlike class-specific MMD, CMMD can be efficiently estimated with fewer samples, enabling training in a mini-batch manner suitable for deep models. Due to the absence of true target labels, we leverage discriminant information in the target domain to estimate CMMD, introducing mutual information to quantify the information represented by predicted categories. By maximizing mutual information, we account for both individual and overall discrimination information. DCAN is designed to learn a conditional domain-invariant feature space and can also be extended for Partial UDA tasks. We evaluate DCAN on both UDA and Partial UDA tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that DCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n1) We introduce DCAN, a new deep domain adaptation approach, to address both UDA and Partial UDA challenges by aligning the conditional distributions of deep features and extracting discriminant information from source and target domains.\n2) We incorporate CMMD to efficiently measure conditional distribution discrepancies between domains. CMMD can be estimated using mini-batch samples, facilitating end-to-end training in DCAN. Additionally, to improve pseudo-label accuracy, we employ mutual information to extract discriminant information from the target domain.\n3) Extensive experimental results indicate that DCAN outperforms existing UDA and Partial UDA methods across various image benchmarks.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II provides a brief review of related works. In Section III, we delve into the details of DCAN, presenting two algorithms that address both UDA and Partial UDA problems. Section IV discusses experimental results and analysis, comparing DCAN with several state-of-the-art methods. Section V concludes the paper.",
        "Fuzzy rule-based classifiers (FRCs) have gained popularity in real-world applications due to several advantages: 1) they offer strong classification performance, 2) they can leverage existing expert knowledge, and 3) they provide a degree of explainability [1]. FRCs were initially popularized as a set of fuzzy If-Then rules for classification [2]-[4]. The foundational work on FRCs [2] extended Wang and Mendel's framework [5] to include fuzzy classification rules, making significant contributions in weighting and aggregating fuzzy rules.\n\nHowever, FRCs face a major limitation: the size of the rule space increases exponentially with data dimensionality. For a dataset with n features, if each axis of the n-dimensional pattern space is divided into p fuzzy subsets, the potential number of fuzzy rules is p^n. A large rule space not only increases the number of generated rules but also raises generalization issues [6] when data is insufficient. An FRC characterized by an excessive number of rules is prone to overfitting. To address these concerns, several strategies have been developed over the years.\n\nRule generation strategies for FRCs are typically framed as a multi-objective problem, aiming to find optimal rule sets that maximize classification accuracy while minimizing the number of rules [7]. FRC frameworks are fine-tuned in various ways before use. A common approach involves using measures or methods to assess the importance of individual rules and select the optimal rule set [4], [8]-[14]. These include genetic algorithms for rule selection [4], [11], [12], fuzzy similarity measures to assess rule importance [8], and methods that use the properties of the rule generation framework to identify and remove redundant rules [9], [10]. Another approach involves evaluating the importance of features and selecting only the most useful ones [7], [15], [16]. A third method for reducing the number and length of rules involves applying orthogonal transforms, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to the rule consequent matrix [17]-[19]. During rule reduction, interpolation methods are often used to account for lost rules [19], [20]. A fourth approach to optimize rule sets involves tuning membership functions and adding weights or confidence values to individual rules [21], [22].\n\nNeuro-fuzzy inference systems offer another paradigm in FRCs. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) provide significant advantages, such as flexibility to model complex problems and the ability to quickly learn network weights using backpropagation algorithms. These advantages make ANNs ideal for use in fuzzy systems. Some neuro-fuzzy frameworks for FRCs include SuPFuNIS [23], Fu-GeNeSys [24], CNFS [25], and a connectionist framework for feature selection while learning FRCs [26], [27]. These frameworks modify the architecture of feedforward neural networks (FFNs) to incorporate fuzzy logic, learning related parameters through backpropagation. While they achieve good classification accuracy with a compact rule base, there are several concerns: 1) without regularization techniques, FFNs are susceptible to overfitting, 2) random parameter initialization can lead to suboptimal solutions, especially with multiple hidden layers [28], 3) methods from [26] and [27] are computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for larger datasets, and 4) there is no planned attempt to generate improved feature representations for better classification of non-separable complex data. This last concern applies not only to neuro-fuzzy FRCs but to most existing FRCs [2]-[4], [7]-[27]. This paper introduces a novel neuro-fuzzy architecture for FRCs aimed at addressing these concerns. Recent works [29]-[31] have proposed frameworks for deep rule-based FRCs, but none have utilized autoencoders or focused on improved feature representation.\n\nExisting FRC architectures typically operate on input feature representations directly. With deep learning revolutionizing how feature representations are modeled for complex data classification [32]-[36], this paper introduces a new approach for generating compact and effective fuzzy rules using autoencoders (AEs).",
        "The 3GPP has adopted a new microservice- and web-based architecture called 5G-SBA [1]. Leveraging network functions (NFs) [2], the SBA enables flexibility, reusability, and customization within the 5G network.  This robust architecture necessitates an efficient orchestration system, with Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) poised to play a key role in enabling fast and reliable NF programmability [3].  However, emerging 5G use cases, such as autonomous vehicles sharing sensor data with ultra-low latency requirements, exceed the capabilities of current device-centric mobility approaches.  These demanding scenarios can be addressed by leveraging Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) [4], which allows application instantiation near the network edge, close to users.  MEC is recognized as crucial for meeting the stringent Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of 5G [5].\n\nUnlike resource-rich data centers that can accommodate standard virtualization technologies (VMs and servers), MEC nodes have limited computational resources.  Moreover, standards development organizations are actively promoting microservice-based approaches and architectures [6], [7]. Consequently, container technologies offer a compelling alternative to traditional VMs [8] for MEC environments and microservices due to their rapid deployment, startup time, fast replication, live service migration, and scaling capabilities.\n\nBoth 3GPP and ETSI proposals offer numerous benefits, particularly reduced network latency.  However, today's highly mobile users can quickly move away from the original MEC node hosting their service, impacting flexibility.  To address this, the Follow Me Cloud (FMC) concept [9], [10] enables service mobility between MEC nodes while maintaining low-latency communication by migrating a single service instance along with the user.  Furthermore, emerging microservices, often overlooked by telecommunication standardization bodies, are expected to dominate the Data Network (DN).  As these modern services may span multiple MECs, new challenges arise in managing distributed instances to ensure service continuity.  Inter-instance links within distributed MEC applications, in addition to user-related links, must be considered.  Therefore, assuming these challenges fall under the umbrella of Service Function Chain (SFC) migration, this paper contributes:\n\n* Four practical SFC migration patterns supporting microservice-based applications in the DN within the proposed combined 3GPP and ETSI architecture.\n* A detailed evaluation of these patterns based on various criteria to validate this new migration approach.\n* A comparison to identify the most suitable SFC migration pattern for the 5G network.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II reviews related work. Section III presents various SFC migration patterns with their respective design overviews and suitable implementations. Section IV details the experimental setup and discusses the results. Finally, Section V concludes the paper and introduces future research challenges.\n\n\n**II. RELATED WORK**\n\nMachen et al. [11] presented a multi-layer framework for migrating active applications in MEC, demonstrating reduced migration times. However, downtime remained considerable, averaging 2 seconds with blank containers, likely due to the absence of an iterative approach in live migration.  The authors of [12] proposed and evaluated three mechanisms to enhance user experience using container-based live migration, showing improvements over previous work. Addad et al. [13] introduced a framework for managing reliable live migrations of virtual resources across different Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms, handling unexpected issues while ensuring high QoS and low downtime without human intervention. Their approach considered inter-cloud migration using SDN for traffic steering and redirection, incorporating multiple migration processes.  Sun et al. [14] investigated migrating correlated VM instances, focusing on relationships between concurrently migrated VMs.  Haikun and Bingsheng [15] presented a coordinated live migration approach for multi-tier applications in cloud environments, differentiating single-VM migration from multi-tier application migration and formulating a correlated VM migration problem. They designed and implemented a coordination system applicable to SFC migration strategies in the network control plane. However, they did not consider microservice-based technologies (containers), crucial for 5G and beyond.  Unlike previous works, this study introduces complete SFC migration patterns, incorporating SDN implications and inter-cloud live migration. Given the increasing mobility and low-latency requirements of emerging use cases, this work is essential for achieving the 1 ms latency target for 5G and future mobile systems.",
        "Semantic communication, a core technology anticipated for 6G wireless networks, offers high communication efficiency by transmitting compact semantic features instead of raw data bit sequences [1].  While traditional communication systems offer some inherent privacy due to redundant bits [2]-[4], semantic communication\u2019s conciseness poses a significant security risk. This paper addresses this vulnerability by introducing the Model Inversion Eavesdropping Attack (MIEA) and proposing a defense mechanism.\n\nExisting semantic communication research primarily employs deep learning (DL) to extract and reconstruct these features [5].  However, this reliance on DL introduces vulnerabilities.  Transmitted semantic features, if intercepted, could allow malicious actors to reconstruct the original message using DL-based attacks [9].  Furthermore, the compact nature of semantic features may leak more private information than traditional bit sequences.  For instance, an attacker could add perturbations to the transmitted data, causing errors in downstream tasks like image classification or speech recognition [7].  Similarly, semantic data poisoning attacks can manipulate the received message entirely, as demonstrated by Du et al. [8], where a desired image is replaced with an unrelated one by minimizing the difference between their semantic features.\n\n\nSecurity in semantic communication is crucial for two primary reasons. First, the compact and semantically rich nature of transmitted symbols potentially reveals more private information than traditional methods. Second, the deep learning models integral to semantic communication are susceptible to various attacks. Several studies have explored these security concerns [6]-[8]. While Tung et al. [6] proposed encrypting the transmitted signal, this method introduces substantial computational overhead.\n\n\nIn MIEA, an attacker attempts to reconstruct the original message by inverting the transmitter's DL model using intercepted symbols. This attack is explored under both white-box (attacker knows the DL model) and black-box (attacker does not know the DL model) settings.  To mitigate this threat, we propose a defense method based on random permutation and substitution.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II provides a foundational overview of semantic communication. Section III details the proposed MIEA under both white-box and black-box settings and introduces our defense method.

        "In recent years, memory-safe languages such as Rust and Go have gained significant popularity and adoption, remaining among the fastest-growing languages to date [GitHub Team 2023]. However, for safety-critical, low-level applications, C and C++ continue to be the languages of choice due to their ability to interact with the operating system and memory at extremely low levels. While C and C++ allow developers to achieve high performance, particularly in resource-constrained environments, they are fundamentally memory-unsafe. This means they enable developers to \"shoot themselves in the foot\" with ease, resulting in a plethora of well-known attack vectors, especially memory corruption bugs [Szekeres et al. 2013]. Indeed, recent studies by Google [Chromium Project 2020] and Microsoft [MSRC Team 2019] estimate that memory-related errors, such as buffer overflows or dangling pointers, are the root cause of 70% of security vulnerabilities in widely deployed software.\n\nSince it is unrealistic to expect the software industry to rewrite everything, especially legacy code, in Rust, we must ask: what can be done to mitigate the impact of incorrect memory management in existing software codebases? As Berger [2012] argued, \"the software industry is in a position similar to that of the automobile industry of the 1950s, delivering software with lots of horsepower and tailfins but no safety measures of any kind.\" One such safety measure is the memory allocator, which often serves as the last line of defense against incorrect memory management by the client program. Recognizing this, modern memory allocators [Berger and Zorn 2006; GrapheneOS Development Team 2021; Leijen et al. 2019; LLVM Project 2023; Novark and Berger 2010; Silvestro et al. 2017] often include mitigations against common heap vulnerabilities, such as randomizing allocations or separating heap metadata from the heap itself. The net effect is that attacks become harder to conduct, and the allocator provides some degree of protection against incorrect programs.\n\nHowever, allocators themselves are not immune to the types of bugs they are supposed to defend against. They are typically written in C/C++, and because they are on the critical path of most, if not all, client programs, allocators must fulfill numerous goals [Wilson et al. 1995], such as high performance, low memory consumption, maximizing concurrency, and minimizing heap contention. Meeting these goals requires custom data structures and low-level pointer and bit manipulations, which often lead to bugs. Even widely used and audited allocators like glibc are not immune, with several issues reported in recent years [glibc 2017a, b, 2020; MSRC Team 2021; MySQL 2019; Portal 2013; Sautereau 2021; Theftguy 2020].\n\nBecause allocators are so critical, they deserve, in our opinion, the highest degree of assurance; that is, allocators ought to be formally verified to guarantee that, no matter the input, they will always correctly and safely maintain their data structures and invariants, ensuring functional correctness. Formal verification has been successfully applied to various application domains, such as compilers [Barthe et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2014; Leroy 2006], operating systems [Gu et al. 2016; Klein et al. 2018, 2009], and cryptography [Almeida et al. 2020; Appel 2015; Erbsen et al. 2019; Polubelova et al. 2020; Protzenko et al. 2020; Ye et al. 2017]. Formal verification has also been applied to memory allocators [Appel and Naumann 2020; Gu et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2019; Mangano et al. 2016; Marti et al. 2006; Sahebolamri et al. 2018; Sammler et al. 2021; Tuch et al. 2007]. However, to the best of our knowledge, formal verification has never been applied to a real-world allocator, complete with advanced bookkeeping data structures, sharded allocation pools, performance optimizations, fine-grained concurrency, defensive security mitigations, and so on. In short, there is no verified, state-of-the-art modern memory allocator.\n\nWe posit there are several reasons for this glaring omission from the formal verification landscape. First, the secure allocator community has little overlap with the programming languages (PL) community, meaning there are many well-established, peer-validated allocator designs, but they have yet to be subjected to formal verification. In other words, the difficulty today lies not in proving a design secure, but rather in proving its implementation secure.",

The absence of explicit source-target vocabulary mapping makes it particularly challenging to enforce specific terminology in domain-specific translations.\n\nConsider this practical example: A Chinese-English NMT system trained for e-commerce encounters the brand name \"\u7ea2\u7c73\". Without prior exposure to this term in its training data, the system would literally translate it as \"red (\u7ea2) rice (\u7c73)\" instead of the correct brand name \"Redmi\". To address such issues, translation professionals typically maintain domain-specific dictionaries to ensure accurate and consistent translations of specialized terms.\n\n## Previous Approaches and Their Limitations\n\nResearchers have pursued two main strategies to address this challenge:\n\n1. **Model Re-training with Lexical Constraints**\n   - Implementation through placeholder mechanisms (Crego et al., 2016)\n   - Use of code-mixed training (Song et al., 2019; Dinu et al., 2019)\n   - Key limitation: Cannot reliably guarantee constraint adherence during testing\n\n2. **Constrained Beam Search Decoding**\n   - Proposed by various researchers (Hokamp and Liu, 2017; Post and Vilar, 2018; Hu et al., 2019)\n   - Offers better control over target constraint terms\n   - Major drawback: Significantly reduced decoding speed\n\n## A Novel Non-autoregressive Approach\n\nOur research introduces a different approach using non-autoregressive translation. We leverage the Levenshtein Transformer (LevT) (Gu et al., 2019), which employs an edit-based generation model performing iterative deletion and insertion operations during inference. This approach offers two key advantages:\n\n1.",

In this setting:\n- A learner observes a context from a fixed distribution at each step\n- The learner selects an action\n- The learner receives a noisy reward\n\nThe primary goal is to maximize accumulated rewards over n rounds, measured by regret compared to optimal actions. This framework has found widespread applications in:\n- Recommendation systems\n- Online advertising  \n- Clinical trials\n\n## Linear Contextual Bandits: Core Concepts\n\nLinear contextual bandit is a prominent instance of this framework, valued for its:\n- Computational efficiency\n- Strong theoretical guarantees\n\nIn this setting:\n- The reward for each context x and action a is represented as a linear combination between:\n  - d-dimensional features \u03c6(x, a) \u2208 Rd\n  - An unknown parameter \u03b8 \u2208 Rd\n- \u03c6 is referred to as a realizable representation\n\n## Algorithmic Approaches and Performance Bounds\n\nAlgorithms based on the optimism-in-the-face-of-uncertainty principle (e.g., LinUCB and OFUL) achieve:\n- Minimax regret bound: O(Sd\u221an ln(nL))\n- Problem-dependent regret: O(S\u00b2d\u00b2/\u0394 ln\u00b2(nL))\n\nWhere:\n- \u0394: minimum gap between best and second-best action rewards across contexts\n- L and S: upper bounds to the \u2113\u2082-norm of \u03c6 and \u03b8 respectively\n\n## Challenges and Limitations\n\nThe representation's impact on performance extends beyond just dimension d and norm bounds L and S:\n- Different realizable representations with identical parameters d and S can yield significantly different performance\n- Some \"good\" representations enable LinUCB to achieve constant regret (not scaling with horizon n)\n\nRecent research has:\n- Identified conditions for achieving constant regret with LinUCB\n- Demonstrated sub-linear regret for greedy algorithms\n- Established regret guarantees for model selection between linear and multi-arm representations\n\n## Technical Details of LinUCB Implementation\n\nLinUCB's operation involves:\n1. Building parameter estimates through ridge regression\n2. Constructing confidence ellipsoids\n3. Selecting actions based on upper-confidence bounds\n\nThe algorithm achieves regret bounds of:\n- O(S\u03c6d\u03c6\u221an ln(nL\u03c6/\u03b4)) with probability \u2265 1-\u03b4\n- O(S\u00b2\u03c6d\u00b2\u03c6/\u0394 ln\u00b2(nL\u03c6/\u03b4)) when minimum gap \u0394 > 0 exists\n\nThis restructuring presents the material in a more logical progression, moving from general concepts to specific implementations while maintaining clear thematic sections.",
        "Bushfires present a significant threat to communities and natural ecosystems not only in Australia but also globally. Simulated fires play a crucial role in providing essential data for first responders to evaluate vulnerable areas, assess the risk posed by approaching fire fronts, and develop effective response strategies. Platforms like Spark [Miller et al., 2015] and Phoenix [Tolhurst and Chong, 2010] utilize diverse techniques to forecast the progression of a fire front over time. These simulations rely on empirical rate-of-spread (ROS) calculations, which determine the speed at which a fire can spread based on factors such as fuel availability, temperature, slope, wind speed, and wind direction [Cruz et al., 2015].\n\nEach simulation run generates a potential future fire front, and to estimate the uncertainty of a fire reaching a specific location, multiple simulations must be run under varying environmental conditions. However, running a large number of simulations can be computationally intensive, posing a potential obstacle to this type of analysis.\n\nEmulation, a machine learning technique, seeks to replicate a complex, resource-intensive process model by utilizing a set of training examples. We have developed an emulator that mimics a simulated fire front, and we discuss how such surrogate models can be leveraged more efficiently in the future to characterize a wide array of fire scenarios, each simulated under a range of environmental conditions.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nSearching for a randomly moving target in a discrete environment presents significant challenges. The probability of target detection at any location depends on both the timing of observation and the sequence of previous search efforts. This temporal and spatial interdependence creates complex nonlinear optimization problems with integer variables when determining optimal searcher paths. The challenge is further complicated by operational constraints on the searchers, including travel speed limitations, endurance requirements, and the need for deconfliction between multiple searchers.\n\nIn this paper, we present a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that addresses these challenges comprehensively. Our model optimizes paths for multiple searchers over a defined planning horizon, maximizing the probability of detecting a randomly moving target that may employ camouflage. We introduce a new linearized model and enhance two existing models to accommodate operational constraints and heterogeneous searchers. To improve computational efficiency, we develop three key innovations: a preprocessing technique, a lazy-constraint scheme within an outer-approximation solution method, and three cutting plane algorithms. Through extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate the model's capabilities and identify the most effective computational strategies for various scenarios.\n\nThis research has practical applications in several domains. Search-and-detection operations conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy rely on similar tools, as do counter-drug interdiction and counter-piracy operations. Additionally, as autonomous systems become more prevalent, there is a growing need for algorithms that can guide large groups of these systems in search tasks, particularly in challenging environments such as underground spaces.\n\nThe existing literature on search problems is extensive, with our work building upon established foundations while introducing novel elements. Unlike models that consider reactive or adaptive targets, we focus on randomly moving targets, allowing us to optimize a parameterized Markov decision process without the computational complexity of a full dynamic program, provided false positive detections are excluded.\n\nOur work advances the field in several ways. While previous research has largely focused on homogeneous searchers, we accommodate heterogeneous searchers with varying sensor capabilities, endurance levels, and travel speeds. We also introduce the novel feature of target camouflage, where the target's detectability varies randomly over time, adding a new dimension to the traditional random trajectory model.\n\n[Continue with the remaining sections, maintaining the same level of clarity and professional tone...]\n\nThe text continues with detailed technical sections, but this revision demonstrates the key improvements in readability and flow while maintaining the academic rigor of the original.",
        "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has become increasingly relevant in various real-world applications that require multiple agents to work cooperatively, such as traffic signal control (Xu et al., 2021), power dispatch (Wang et al., 2021b), finance (Fang et al., 2023), and robot control (Orr & Dutta, 2023). With advancements in deep learning, MARL techniques have been effectively applied to these cooperative tasks. In MARL, agents interact with a shared environment, make local decisions, and are trained to maximize either a shared reward or the sum of individual rewards.\n\nThere are two primary paradigms in cooperative MARL, dictated by the availability of other agents' information during training: centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) and fully decentralized learning. In CTDE, agents have access to global information during training, but rely solely on local information during execution. This approach has been the focus of many studies (Lowe et al., 2017; Sunehag et al., 2018; Rashid et al., 2018, and others), achieving significant performance on benchmarks like the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (Samvelyan et al., 2019a) and Google Research Football (Kurach et al., 2020). However, in situations where global information is inaccessible, or the number of agents varies, centralized methods become ineffective, necessitating fully decentralized learning (Zhang et al., 2021a).\n\nIn fully decentralized learning, agents receive no information from others, treating them as part of the environment, which, in turn, becomes non-stationary (Foerster et al., 2017; Jiang & Lu, 2022). This non-stationarity, which conflicts with the assumptions of most reinforcement learning methods, presents significant challenges, and, as a result, the development of decentralized learning algorithms, remains limited.",
        "With the increasing penetration of distributed generations (DG), particularly inverter-based energy resources (IB-ER), in active distribution networks (ADNs), voltage violations and high network losses are becoming more severe, especially with reversed active power flow.  While IB-ERs can provide Volt/VAR control (VVC) support, effectively leveraging this capability presents challenges.  Traditional model-based VVC optimization methods, which generate optimal strategies for voltage regulation devices and reactive power resources, struggle due to inaccuracies in network parameters. These theoretical parameters often deviate significantly from real-world operational states, creating a model mismatch that hinders practical application.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel two-stage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for optimizing reactive power distribution in ADNs, addressing the limitations of model-based approaches.  The method combines offline learning with online learning and application, leveraging the benefits of both model-based and model-free control.\n\nIn the offline stage, an approximate ADN model is constructed using theoretical parameters.  Recognizing the inherent inaccuracies, a novel joint adversarial soft actor-critic (JASAC) algorithm is employed within an adversarial Markov decision process (AMDP) framework.  An adversary agent, representing modeling errors and risks, is trained alongside the offline agent (OFF-A). This adversarial training enhances the OFF-A's robustness to model mismatch, minimizing the \"transfer gap\" when applied to the real system.  JASAC leverages shared information between the adversary and OFF-A, ensuring efficient convergence.\n\nThe online stage utilizes the knowledge gained offline. The OFF-A is transferred to an online agent (ON-A), which continues learning and application using the state-of-the-art soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm.  This offline pre-training significantly accelerates online training and improves safety, mitigating the risks associated with deploying untrained DRL agents directly in real-world systems.\n\nThis two-stage approach offers several key advantages: 1) It combines the practicality of model-free online operation with the efficiency of incorporating approximate model knowledge offline. 2) The novel JASAC algorithm, applicable to other DRL applications, efficiently trains a robust OFF-A through adversarial learning. 3) Transferring the robust OFF-A to the online stage significantly improves performance and safety compared to existing DRL-based VVC methods.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II formulates the VVC problem as an MDP for the online stage and an AMDP for the offline stage.  Section III details the proposed VVC algorithm and JASAC.  Section IV presents and analyzes the numerical results.  Finally, Section V concludes the paper.  VVC has been successfully integrated into distribution management systems to optimize reactive power flow, eliminating voltage violations and reducing network losses. Conventionally, VVC employs model-based optimization to generate optimal strategies for voltage regulation devices and reactive power resources.  Numerous centralized and decentralized algorithms exist, including conic relaxation, interior point methods, mixed integer linear programming, evolutionary algorithms, local control, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and robust/scenario-based optimization techniques.  However, these methods rely on accurate system models.  Model-free methods, such as those based on game theory or gradient-based optimization applied to wind farm control, offer an alternative.  Recently, DRL algorithms have shown promise in various control tasks, leading to the development of DRL-based VVC methods.  However, online training of DRL agents can be costly and risky. Offline training using simulated ADN models is preferable, but model inaccuracies necessitate specialized algorithms to bridge the transfer gap.

        "The natural products chemical space encompasses hundreds of thousands of molecules that are not only fascinating from a chemical perspective but also due to the diverse and impressive biological properties that many of them possess. The significance of this chemical space is further highlighted by the substantial number of these molecules currently used as medicines in human and veterinary practice.\n\nFrom a phytochemical and pharmacognostic standpoint, natural molecules are categorized into different families based on their biosynthetic origins or shared chemical characteristics. Many of these natural molecule families play crucial roles in human health, not only in medicine but also in areas such as nutrition and cosmetics. Among these families, terpenes stand out as a diverse group of compounds that have found applications in various industries. Terpenes have been utilized not only in medicine (such as artemisinin and taxol) but also in food (carotenoids as colorants), flavors (menthol, limonene, pinene), and preservatives (eugenol).\n\nWith tens of thousands of known terpenes, they are often classified based on the number of carbons they contain, reflecting their biosynthetic pathways. Terpenes can be categorized as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), triterpenes (C30), and so forth, depending on the number of C5 isoprene units. Some terpenes may also be lactones or contain sugars, leading to their classification as terpene lactones or terpene glycosides, respectively.\n\nAs with other classes of natural products, the rapid discovery of new molecules makes it increasingly challenging to manually curate and study each molecule's chemical descriptors individually. Data science-based approaches are essential in organizing, interpreting, and filtering vast amounts of data, sometimes unveiling relationships that might go unnoticed by human observation.\n\nThe quality of data in data science-driven analysis is crucial, and the digitalization of information has facilitated the use of data science frameworks to explore the natural products chemical space. In this study, we applied a data science and artificial intelligence approach to analyze the COCONUT database, the largest and most comprehensive natural product database available. According to the most recent source, over 55,000 terpenes were known, and we extracted 59,000 terpenes from this database to conduct our analysis.",
        "The utilization of large-scale pre-training for dialogue generation (Zhang et al., 2020; Freitas et al., 2020) has significantly propelled the development of interactive and humanlike dialogue systems. However, despite advancements, cutting-edge open-domain chatbots like BlenderBot (Roller et al., 2021), EVA (Zhou et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2022), and PLATO (Bao et al., 2021b) still struggle with consistency in their interactions, often producing self-contradictory or contextually inconsistent responses (Shuster et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022a). These inconsistencies violate Grice's cooperative principle (Grice, 1975) and significantly undermine users' long-term trust (Huang et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2022).\n\nDetecting dialogue contradictions has proven to be a valuable strategy for enhancing chatbot consistency (Welleck et al., 2019; Nie et al., 2021), but it remains a challenging task. The conversational context necessitates the consideration and modeling of contextual information. For example, in Figure 1's \"Contradiction\" scenario, while b2 does not explicitly contradict b1, given u1, the intended meaning of b1 should be \"I like dogs, cats,\" making b1 and b2 contradictory. Conversely, in the \"Non-contradiction\" instance, although b1 and b2 may appear inconsistent (\"love\" vs. \"dislike\"), considering the dialogue context, b2 actually means \"I dislike noodles,\" aligning with b1 and not creating a contradiction.\n\nDespite this challenge, current datasets for contradiction detection (Dziri et al., 2019 et al., 2019) typically only focus on the textual entailment relationship between isolated sentences (Dagan et al., 2005), which inadequately addresses the complexity of dialogue contradiction detection due to the absence of contextual information. A recent study (Nie et al., 2021) introduced the DE-CODE dataset, where conversations contain contradictions between the final utterances and the dialogue histories. However, DECODE lacks broad coverage of typical contradiction categories, with most cases being human-written, creating a gap from real-world scenarios where users prompt chatbots to make contradictions.\n\nIn this study, we introduce CDCONV, a benchmark for Contradiction Detection in Chinese Conversations, comprising 12K multi-turn conversations annotated with contradiction labels (\u00a73). Unlike previous work (e.g., Nie et al., 2021) that focused solely on History Contradiction, CDCONV encompasses two additional categories: Intra-sentence Contradiction and Role Confusion, denoting self-contradictory replies and speaker role confusion, respectively.\n\nDue to the significant imbalance between non-contradiction and contradiction cases in natural human-bot conversations (\u00a73, Nie et al., 2021), we combine automatic and manual methods to construct CDCONV conversations (\u00a74.1). Initially, we employ automatic methods to simulate common user behaviors triggering chatbots to make contradictions (\u00a74.2), followed by meticulous human screening and annotation to ensure data quality (\u00a74.3). We validate the efficacy of these trigger methods and highlight how top Chinese open-domain chatbots (EVA and PLATO) can be easily led into making contradictions (\u00a74.4).\n\nFinally, we evaluate prominent Chinese pre-trained models on CDCONV (\u00a75), emphasizing the critical role of contextual information modeling in dialogue contradiction detection. Nonetheless, there remains ample room for future research in dialogue modeling, integrating common sense and worldly knowledge, and reasoning.\n\nIn summary, our contributions include:\n- Introducing CDCONV, a benchmark for detecting contradictions in Chinese conversations, featuring 12K annotated conversations covering three typical contradiction categories.",
        "3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) is a critical component in various applications like autonomous robotics, virtual reality, and the metaverse. This technique localizes specific objects within 3D scenes based on textual descriptions. While this task may seem simple for humans, it poses a significant challenge for machines due to their limited perceptual capabilities. The goal of 3DVG is to accurately pinpoint objects while eliminating distractions.\n\nTraditional supervised 3DVG approaches achieve localization by matching objects generated by 3D detectors with textual descriptions. These approaches are precise but require extensive annotations and are limited by pre-defined vocabularies. To address these issues, a novel visual programming approach integrating zero-shot learning and large language models (LLMs) is proposed.\n\nZero-shot learning can generalize across new categories using pre-trained capabilities like CLIP, while LLMs provide planning and reasoning capabilities essential for 3DVG. A visual programming approach is developed, involving generating a 3D visual program with LLMs, converting it into Python code, and identifying the target object's location through code execution. A language-object correlation module enhances accuracy by merging geometric and appearance information.\n\nThe contributions of the proposed approach include eliminating the need for extensive annotations, transforming visual programs into Python code, and introducing relation and LOC modules for spatial reasoning and open-vocabulary localization. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show superior performance, comparable to existing supervised approaches.\n\nIn summary, the study presents an innovative 3D visual programming approach for 3DVG, showcasing improved localization accuracy without the need for extensive annotations. By leveraging zero-shot learning and LLMs, the proposed method demonstrates strong performance on standard datasets, offering a promising direction for future advancements in 3D scene understanding.",

This interaction triggers an energy exchange, which is evident in the fluctuation of the damping rate across two or more structural modes. Flow-induced structural motion is a significant cause for concern as it can lead to fatigue failure, and the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) part 25, 25.629 requires that no instability is present within the flight envelope [1].\n\n## Flutter Flight Testing Process\nFlutter flight test is an expensive and dangerous endeavor. The process involves:\n1. Artificial excitation applied to the lifting surface of the airframe\n2. Measurement of subsequent responses\n3. Assessment of the airframe's aeroelastic stability\n\nDuring a flutter flight test campaign, at a specific test point with given Mach number and altitude:\n- The pilot stabilizes the aircraft\n- Using Flight Test Interface (FTI), control surface pulses are input into the aileron, elevator, and rudder\n- Data is recorded electronically, including:\n  - Excitation force\n  - Response acceleration\n  - Flight parameters (speed, altitude, fuel weight, aircraft configuration)\n- Data is transmitted to the ground station for real-time analysis\n\nFlutter analysts at the ground station monitor responses to ensure they are damped. After completing maneuvers, the pilot returns to a safe speed while analysts examine damping characteristics from accelerometer channels. Once cleared by the flutter telemetry crew, the process repeats at the next test point.\n\n## Challenges in Data Analysis\nSeveral factors complicate the system identification process:\n- Noise contamination\n- Turbulence\n- Non-optimal excitation of modes\n- Sensor malfunction\n- Limited data transmission due to bandwidth constraints\n\n## Historical Development and Methodologies\nSince the 1980s, significant progress has been made in flutter prediction techniques [2-7]. Notable methodologies include:\n- Autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) method [17, 18]\n- Nonlinear autoregressive moving-average exogenous (NARMAX) [19, 20]\n- Least-Square fitting of Complex Frequency domain functions (LSCF) [21, 22]\n- Moving block approach (MBA) [23]\n- Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) [25, 26]\n- Higher-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) [32]\n\n## Current Research Framework\nThis research presents an innovative framework combining:\n- Time-delay embedded DMD\n- Robust Principle Component Analysis (RPCA) filtering\n- Sparsity promoting criterion for mode selection\n\nKey features:\n- Rapid processing (< 45 seconds per test point)\n- Automatic detection of aeroelastic modes\n- Compressed sensing DMD algorithm for limited sensor measurements\n- Effective handling of sensor malfunction scenarios\n\n## Paper Structure\nThe remainder of the paper is organized into:\n- Section II: Dataset and maneuver identification\n- Section III: Mathematical modeling and framework implementation\n- Section IV: Results analysis and comparison\n- Section V: Summary and conclusions\n\nThis restructured version presents the information in a more logical sequence, moving from basic concepts to specific methodologies and current research, while maintaining clear thematic connections between sections.",

These algorithms generate masks that classify pixels into foreground and background categories, serving diverse applications from security and robotics to satellite and medical imaging\u2014even extending to specialized tasks like counting penguins in Arctic colonies.\n\nTraditional segmentation algorithms require extensive ground truth labeled data for training, which relies on human annotation\u2014a process both time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, researchers have actively explored methods to generate annotations from user inputs.\n\nVarious approaches have emerged, utilizing user-provided cues such as bounding boxes, clicks, and scribbles. While these methods have shown varying degrees of success across different datasets, developing a universal, principled approach to incorporating user cues remains an open challenge. Notably, extreme points (EPs) have gained significant attention following research demonstrating their superior efficiency compared to other input methods like bounding boxes.\n\nThis study introduces a novel approach to encoding information from extreme points and corrective clicks through a Soft Focus Generator (SFG). The SFG produces a heat map that serves as input for generating dense segmentation masks (Figure 1). Our method, enhanced with a dual-attention module, demonstrates exceptional performance across challenging datasets including PASCAL, COCO, SBD, GrabCut, and Berkeley. The proposed system\u2014FAIRS (Focus and Attention for Interactive Robust Segmentation)\u2014achieves superior evaluation metrics with fewer clicks compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nTo validate FAIRS's effectiveness in generating training data, we conducted a rigorous experiment: training an untrained version of our model using only synthetic labels generated by a trained version. This weakly-supervised implementation achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, falling only slightly behind the version trained with ground truth labels. Additionally, FAIRS demonstrates robust performance when working with fewer than four extreme points or when processing corrective clicks for refinement during interactive segmentation, maintaining consistent annotation quality across these diverse scenarios.",

The activity was conducted virtually for the theoretical course Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Modelling (SEO). As part of Teaching Learning Processes (TLP), Codeathon was planned as an Alternate Assessment Tool (AAT) to motivate students and explore their creativity in problem-solving techniques. Through Activity-based Learning (ABL) and Project-based Learning (PBL), students develop skills and nurture creativity, learning to analyze and think creatively.\n\nObject-Oriented Modeling emphasizes on designing solutions for software programmers, while the Software Engineering course discusses approaches used in solving real-world problems to develop software products or services. BMSCE, as an autonomous institute, allows faculties to frame the curriculum and introduce new TLP for their courses. TLP is a method of establishing learning objectives and creating implementation plans to meet course outcomes. Codeathon activity has been conducted for the Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Modelling course for four consecutive years, emphasizing real-world problems with solutions proposed in a day.\n\nThe students analyzed in this study were from the fifth semester, with a total of 180 students (3 sections of 60 students) participating. Faculties formed teams of 3 or 4 students in each group, focusing on creating diverse groups without friends to encourage blended learning. Challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic led to the virtual conduct of the codeathon activity in the academic year 2020-2021, impacting submission time and performance. The activity focused on design and blueprints rather than coding, showcasing idealistic solutions and adherence to timelines.\n\nTeams were tasked with analyzing and modeling solutions for challenging problems in sectors hit hard by the pandemic.

        "Here's the polished version:\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the gold standard for diagnosing brain tumors, particularly glioblastoma (GBM). While MRI effectively highlights areas of high tumor cell concentration in GBMs, it has limitations in visualizing regions of lower tumor cell density at tumor borders and, most crucially, areas of diffuse tumor infiltration\u2014a defining characteristic of GBM. Current radiotherapy protocols attempt to address this uncertainty by targeting a uniformly extended volume around MRI-visible tumor boundaries. Although this approach reduces the likelihood of tumor recurrence, it carries the significant drawback of potentially damaging healthy tissue, thereby compromising patients' quality of life.\n\nPersonalizing radiotherapy targets by supplementing MRI scans with individual tumor simulations, which model complete spatial distributions of tumor cell concentration, could better preserve healthy tissue and minimize the risk of secondary malignancies and side effects [2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nConventional approaches to simulation-based personalization model tumor growth for individual patients using differential equation solvers. Personalization is achieved by solving the inverse problem\u2014identifying tumor model parameters that best match MRI signals. However, using numerical solvers for inverse problems results in prohibitively long processing times, impeding implementation in clinical practice. Recent years have seen the development of highly efficient model- and data-driven approaches to address this challenge [6, 7, 8, 5, 4, 9, 10]. While numerical model-based solvers require approximately one hour of computation time [6, 7, 5], data-driven approaches can reduce this to minutes [9, 10, 11, 12]. However, these approaches rely on neural networks to predict tumor progression, which are known to be unreliable when extrapolating beyond their training distributions\u2014a critical limitation for safety-critical applications.",
        "Active student participation and engagement in the classroom are crucial for successful learning outcomes [1, 2]. Student engagement can be assessed through observable behavioral and emotional components, which are indicators of cognitive engagement [3]. Behavioral engagement involves actions that students take to access the curriculum, such as studying, doing homework, participating in classroom activities, and making physical movements during lectures [4, 5]. Emotional engagement relates to students' feelings about their learning experience, environment, instructors, and classmates [6, 7, 8]. This includes emotions like excitement or happiness about learning, as well as boredom, disinterest, or frustration when struggling to understand. Cognitive engagement involves a psychological investment in academic achievement, demonstrated by a student's ability to conceptualize, organize, and engage deeply with the material [9].\n\nThe purpose of measuring student engagement is to provide instructors with quantitative insights, allowing them to adjust lectures and activities to re-engage students when necessary. This helps in confidentially identifying and assisting disengaged students. However, identifying each student's engagement can be challenging, especially in large classes with free seating. Automating this process could enhance learning, particularly in STEM courses.\n\nIn this study, we focus on automatically measuring behavioral engagement through student body movements. Students' actions can indicate whether they are on-task or off-task during lectures. Actions such as taking notes, typing on a laptop, and raising a hand are typical of engaged students who are on-task. Conversely, actions like using a mobile phone, eating or drinking, and checking the time often signify disengagement. Thus, recognizing student actions is essential for classifying behavioral engagement.\n\nAction recognition is a challenging task due to variations within and between classes, dynamic backgrounds, camera motion, and differing viewpoints. Modalities used to recognize human actions include appearance, depth, optical flow, and human skeleton. Among these, the human skeleton can describe actions as a sequence of moving joints, offering robustness to background and lighting variations.\n\nSkeleton-based action recognition approaches are categorized based on the network architecture used: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN), 3D-CNN, or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). GCN-based approaches [10, 11] model the sequence of human skeletons as spatiotemporal graphs. However, they have limitations in noise robustness and require careful integration with other modalities. In 2D-CNN-based methods [12, 13], manually designed transformations model the skeleton sequence as a pseudo-image, limiting the locality feature of convolutional networks and making these methods less competitive on benchmarks. The 3D-CNN approach [14] uses heatmap volumes to capture the structure and dynamics of skeleton joints over time, providing a holistic representation of actions. The RNN-based approach [15] recognizes simple and complex actions by modeling the motion of individual and combined body parts. We adopt the 3D-CNN model [14] for student action recognition due to its ability to learn spatiotemporal dynamics and its robustness to noise by representing the human skeleton as pseudo heatmaps.\n\nFor student engagement classification, Janez and Andrej [16] used a Kinect sensor to extract features such as body posture, gaze point, and facial characteristics, employing a machine learning classifier for attention estimation. Their bagged trees classifier achieved an engagement recognition accuracy of 75.3%. Sun et al. [17] developed a class behavior dataset and built a framework with three modules: action detection, recognition, and captioning. For action recognition, they used a two-stream network [18] to classify student actions into one of 10 predefined classes, leveraging both appearance and motion information to improve behavior recognition.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow, moving from broad concepts to specific challenges and approaches:\n\nQuantum computers offer the promise of executing some computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. This suggests a violation of the extended Church-Turing thesis, which says that any physically realizable model of computation can be efficiently simulated by a classical Turing machine. Indeed, quantum computers were originally proposed as a means of simulating quantum mechanical systems [1], a task considered classically hard. There has been much progress toward identifying classically difficult problems that quantum computers can solve efficiently, such as integer factorization [2], simulating Hamiltonian dynamics [3][4][5], and extracting information about solutions of high-dimensional linear systems [6].\n\nA significant milestone for the field of quantum computing is the first demonstration that a quantum device can perform computational tasks that a classical device with comparable resources cannot. This milestone has been called quantum supremacy [7, 8], quantum advantage, or a proof of quantumness [9], and has instigated numerous theoretical proposals and experimental efforts. However, there remain formidable technological challenges to building quantum computers, requiring both theoretical and experimental progress in architecture design, fault tolerance, and control.\n\nOne promising approach to demonstrating quantum advantage is analog quantum simulation [10], which involves using one many-body quantum system to simulate another. By building quantum systems with tunable (but perhaps non-universal) Hamiltonians, one can emulate a large class of Hamiltonians that may be difficult to simulate classically. Since it directly encodes hard problems into controllable quantum systems, analog simulation arguably mitigates many of the issues faced by digital approaches [11, 12]. Furthermore, analog simulation avoids Trotter error and other sources of algorithmic error in digital quantum simulation [13, 14]. Indeed, analog simulations of systems with hundreds of qubits have already been performed [15].\n\nVarious proposals for quantum advantage have addressed these challenges in different ways, by making trade-offs between ease of experimental demonstration, ease of verification, security guarantees, and practical applications. A major challenge for both quantum simulation and more general forms of quantum computation is the difficulty of verifying the correctness of a quantum process. While there have been several proposals to verify digital quantum computation [16, 17] based on the Feynman-Kitaev circuit-to-Hamiltonian mapping [18], such protocols are neither designed for analog quantum simulation nor practical on near-term analog quantum devices.\n\nPrevious work towards verifying analog simulation has suggested approaches such as cross-platform verification [19, 20], Hamiltonian learning [20], and performing a Loschmidt echo [20][21][22]. Unlike protocols for digital verification, these approaches can be spoofed by dishonest or inaccurate quantum simulators, and therefore cannot be used to demonstrate quantum advantage in a sound, efficiently verifiable way. A step toward verified analog simulation is made in [23], in which the verifier measures the energy of a parent Hamiltonian of the output state of analog quantum simulation.",
        "Before representation learning started gravitating around deep representations in the last decade, a line of research that sparked interest in the early 2000s was based on the so-called manifold hypothesis. According to it, real-world data given in their raw format (e.g., pixels of images) lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the input space. At that time, most manifold learning algorithms were based on locally linear approximations to points on the sought manifold (e.g., LLE, Isomap) or on spectral methods (e.g., MDS, graph Laplacian eigenmaps).\n\nBack to recent years, two trends are apparent: the use of graph-structured data and their direct processing by machine learning algorithms, and the resurgence of the manifold hypothesis, but with a different flavor - being explicit about the assumed manifold and, perhaps, the inductive bias that it entails: hyperbolic spaces, spherical spaces, and Cartesian products of them. While for the first two the choice can be a priori justified - e.g., complex networks are intimately related to hyperbolic geometry - the last one, originally through the work of Gu et al., is motivated through the presumed flexibility coming from its varying curvature. Our work takes that hypothesis further by exploring the representation properties of several irreducible spaces of non-constant sectional curvature. We use, in particular, Riemannian manifolds where points are represented as specific types of matrices and which are at the sweet spot between semantic richness and tractability.\n\nWith no additional qualifiers, graph embedding is a vaguely specified intermediary step used as part of systems solving a wide range of graph analytics problems. As a particular instance of that general task, here we embed nodes of graphs with structural information only (i.e., undirected and without node or edge labels), as the ones shown in Figure 1, in novel curved spaces, by leveraging the closed-form expressions of the corresponding Riemannian distance between embedding points; the resulting geodesic distances enter a differentiable objective function which \"compares\" them to the ground-truth metric given through the node-to-node graph distances. We focus on the representation capabilities of the considered matrix manifolds relative to the previously studied spaces by monitoring graph reconstruction metrics. We note that preserving graph structure is essential to downstream tasks such as link prediction and node classification.\n\nOur main contributions include the introduction of two families of matrix manifolds for graph embedding purposes: the non-positively curved spaces of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, and the compact, non-negatively curved Grassmann manifolds; reviving Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) in the context of Riemannian optimization as a way to unify, on the one hand, the loss functions based on the reconstruction likelihood of local graph neighborhoods and, on the other hand, the global, all-pairs stress functions used for global metric recovery; a generalization of the usual ranking-based metric to quantify reconstruction fidelity beyond immediate neighbors; a comprehensive experimental comparison of the introduced manifolds against the baselines in terms of their graph reconstruction capabilities, focusing on the impact of curvature.\n\nRelated Work. Our work is inspired by the emerging field of geometric deep learning (GDL) through its use of geometry. That being said, our motivation and approach are different. In GDL, deep networks transform data in a geometry-aware way, usually as part of larger discriminative or generative models.",
        "The ubiquitous connectivity provided by modern cellular technologies, along with the success of mobile web and application paradigms, has introduced the necessity of contextualizing services with location information. While smartphones have supported this capability since their inception, the complexity of the World Wide Web\u2014serving as the backbone for virtually the entire mobile application landscape\u2014and the growing concerns over user privacy make the structured gathering of such information challenging. For example, geographic extensions of HTTP headers were proposed [1] but never approved by the IETF, leaving the collection of this information solely at the application level, either through JavaScript [2] or with OS APIs, subject to user permission. Consequently, mobile phones only share precise positioning data, such as GPS, if explicitly configured to do so, and only with applications and servers that have received specific user permission.\n\nNevertheless, locating users and devices can be valuable beyond the application domain, prompting network operators and third-party developers to employ alternative technologies to obtain location information. Network operators, with access to information from the lower layers of the network, can, for instance, deduce user positions and trajectories by analyzing the cell towers they have visited [3]. However, the most common method of acquiring positioning information, without the explicit use of GPS, is IP Geolocation, or GeoIP, for short.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Graph Neural Networks and Synthetic Dataset Generation: A Framework\n\n## Introduction\nGraphs are widely used data structures that capture relational and structural information between individual entities (nodes) via connections (edges) in many domains. For example, in social networks, a graph-based learning system leverages structural and feature information to make accurate user recommendations. Similarly, in an e-commerce platform, a transaction network can be used to detect fraudulent transactions.\n\n## The Nature of Real-World Graphs\nReal-world graphs are diverse and often feature-rich. In a simple recommendation scenario consisting of user and item nodes, the user nodes would include information about age, gender, and income, while item nodes (e.g., a movie) would be characterized by genre, length, and list of actors. Additionally, edge features may contain information such as user ratings. Such attributed graphs are prevalent, where the graph dataset's structure is enriched with features of the nodes and edges.\n\n## Evolution of Graph Neural Networks\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have recently received increasing attention due to the wide range of applications that deal with data naturally represented as graphs. Motivated by similar developments in other domains, researchers have extended deep learning benefits to this non-Euclidean domain, enabling more streamlined approaches that leverage relational data. Various methods have been developed, including Node2Vec, graph convolution networks (GCN), and graph attention networks (GAT), which have been used for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph clustering. These methods are collectively referred to as geometric deep learning.\n\n## The Challenge: Limited Real-World Datasets\nA central problem in geometric deep learning is the need for real-world datasets that are large enough for industry-scale problems. Most larger public datasets are similar and often derived from academic citation networks, which are too small for these problems. This lack of diversity limits the development and evaluation of graph neural networks (GNN).\n\n## Proposed Solution and Contributions\nIn this work, we propose a framework for synthetic graph generation that can systematically generate graphs with corresponding node or edge features in a scalable manner. Our framework provides a parametric model flexible enough to fit both single and multiple graphs.",
        "Millions of images are taken daily and billions are hosted online thanks to the proliferation of digital cameras and storage. This massive volume of images presents a challenge: how can users effectively retrieve relevant images? This is the core problem of image retrieval.  While similar to document retrieval in user interaction (keywords in, results out), image retrieval is far more complex.  Unlike documents, machines cannot simply use string matching to connect textual queries with images.  Current image search engines rely primarily on surrounding text to represent image content, essentially treating image retrieval as document retrieval. This approach is inherently flawed, as surrounding text is often unavailable or irrelevant, leading to poor retrieval results.\n\nTo improve retrieval accuracy and make all images searchable, machines need to directly measure image-query similarity by extracting information from the images themselves.  This is a difficult task for two key reasons:  1) Extracting semantic information from images, even with state-of-the-art hand-crafted features like super-vector coding, Fisher vectors, and spatial pyramid matching, remains challenging. 2) The vast, potentially infinite, number of possible queries makes building query-specific classifiers impractical.\n\nRecent advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offer a promising solution. DNNs have demonstrated their ability to automatically learn representations from raw data like images and text, excelling in tasks like image classification and word embedding. Inspired by this success, we propose a unified DNN to model image-query similarity.  This DNN combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image representation and a Word Embedding Network (WEN) for query representation.  Both networks output vectors in the same space, allowing image-query similarity to be calculated as the inner product of these vectors. CNNs have proven superior to hand-crafted features in extracting semantic image information, while WENs effectively generate low-dimensional vector representations of words, with query representations modeled as linear combinations of these word vectors.  As illustrated in Figure 1, this unified DNN maps both images and queries into a common feature vector space.\n\nTraining this DNN requires a large dataset.  We utilize a large-scale clickthrough dataset from Bing image search, comprising 23 million clicked image-query pairs, 11.7 million queries, and 1 million images. This dataset\u2019s breadth and depth provide excellent coverage of the sample space, mitigating overfitting even without techniques like dropout.\n\nQualitative results demonstrate that our learned model constructs a meaningful common vector space for images and queries. Quantitative results on an image retrieval task with 1000 queries, compared against competing methods, further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses related work. Section III introduces the unified DNN for joint image-query modeling and learning.  Section V presents experimental results on the large-scale clickthrough dataset.  Finally, Section VI concludes the work.",
        "A clinically feasible and accurate artificial intelligence (AI)-based disease diagnosis model using modern neuroimaging techniques is highly desired for precision medicine. The literature has seen significant advancements in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for personalized diagnosis, which not only reduces human effort but also enhances our understanding of disease mechanisms. The integration of PET/MR equipment offers a unique opportunity to uncover molecular and anatomical changes in a single scan, making PET/MR research a hot topic in clinical studies. However, current brain studies either utilize anatomical MRI with PET or treat the two modalities as separate sources in AI models, leaving the untapped potential of PET/MR.\n\nThis paper presents pioneering research on simultaneous functional PET/MR (sf-PET/MR) for comprehensive characterization of brain metabolic, hemodynamic, and perfusion networks in a single scan for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. It marks a paradigm shift in neuroimaging by concurrently modeling brain connectome and revolutionizing previous AI methodologies by deeply learning from the multifaceted brain connectome at micro and macro levels. While integrating multimodal information with deep learning can leverage deep representations, challenges like hardware accessibility in real clinical settings and increased AI workflow complexity due to modality variations hinder the application of sf-PET/MR in clinical scenarios.\n\nThe study aims to develop a clinically feasible AI model for integrating multimodal sf-PET/MR and uni-model diagnosis in common clinical settings. The model needs to balance multimodal accuracy and uni-model flexibility while handling high-dimensional, non-Euclidean, and complementary brain connectome data.\n\nInstead of traditional modality fusion requiring full-modality data during inference, a multimodal MiXture-of-experts Alignment and Reconstruction Model (MX-ARM) is proposed. This model features a modality-detachable architecture that reduces the need for full modality data during inference. The Mixture-of-Experts utilizes a fingerprint-based router to dynamically allocate modality-specific weights for a combination of multi-layer perceptrons, ensuring modality-independent model performance. Additionally, a modal alignment module aligns PET representations with other modalities, while a multimodal reconstruction module improves representation quality. The model is tested on a carefully curated sf-PET/MR dataset for early AD diagnosis.\n\nThe contributions of this work include: 1) a pioneering design for multimodal brain connectome modeling in a disease population using simultaneous functional PET/MR; 2) an AI framework trained on multimodal sf-PET/MR but implemented on single modality data with balanced accuracy and clinical flexibility; 3) a fingerprint-based mixture-of-experts adapter for adaptive multimodal learning and uni-modal inferencing; and 4) modules for modality Alignment and Reconstruction to enhance representation quality and diagnostic accuracy.",
        "Optimizing networks for distributing quantities, such as passengers in transportation systems or data packets in communication networks, is crucial for network planners.  Similar problems appear in natural systems like river basins and vascular networks.  Various models have been proposed to study these systems within an optimization framework [1, 2, 3, 4]. The standard goal is to find the flow values and network topology that minimize a transportation cost, often chosen as the total power dissipation [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], though alternatives exist depending on the application [10]. More recently, approaches based on the dynamical adaptation of network properties coupled with conservation laws have been proposed [5, 6]. These models can be reformulated within the framework of optimal transport theory, following the work of [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].  Very efficient computational techniques have been developed for solving such optimal transport-based models [13, 14, 15].\n\nIn these systems, a single, undistinguishable flow typically travels through the network. However, different flow types may compete for network infrastructure, yet existing physical models primarily address single-flow scenarios.  Analyzing multi-commodity problems with these methods requires either aggregating all flow types or treating them independently. Both approaches lose crucial information about inter-commodity interactions, which define the multi-commodity nature of these settings. Dedicated multi-commodity methods relying on standard optimization suffer from high computational costs due to the simultaneous assignment of multiple interacting paths to minimize a global cost function. Consequently, existing multi-commodity flow algorithms often ignore these interactions or employ greedy heuristics and approximations, leading to suboptimal solutions [18]. Approaches based on statistical physics and message-passing algorithms have shown improvements [19, 20] but remain computationally expensive.\n\nThis work proposes a model for designing optimal network topologies where multiple resources are transported simultaneously.  Based on optimal transport principles similar to those in [16, 17], and assuming potential-driven flows, the optimal design problem becomes finding the multi-commodity flux distribution that minimizes a global cost functional. Equivalently, it seeks the optimal edge conductivities.  This cost functional extends the optimal-transport Lyapunov functional proposed in [14, 15] to the multi-commodity case. It comprises the sum of the convex costs for transporting all commodities across the network, plus a concave cost proportional to the total network flux.  This second term, representing the cost of building and maintaining the transport infrastructure, controls traffic congestion by either distributing fluxes across many edges or concentrating them on fewer edges, following a principle of economy of scale.\n\nFurthermore, we show that minimizing this cost functional is equivalent to a constrained optimization problem generalizing the single-commodity case. The optimal flux distribution identifies the optimal network topology by discarding edges with low conductivities.  Within this optimization framework, numerical experiments and analytical evidence reveal that optimal network topologies may contain loops due to the distinction between flow types.  Loops are common in both natural and human-made networks [7, 21, 22, 23, 24]. However, in single-commodity settings, studies often find trees to be optimal [1, 2], with loops appearing only under fluctuating flows or for increased robustness [3, 5, 7], requiring changes to the cost function or introducing stochasticity in sources and sinks. In contrast, loops emerge naturally in our multi-commodity model due to the presence of different flow types.\n\nTo minimize the highly non-linear and non-convex cost functional, we propose dynamical equations for edge conductivities, generalizing those in [16, 17] to a multi-commodity scenario, and find their stationary solution.  We demonstrate that the cost functional is a Lyapunov functional (decreasing along solution trajectories) for the proposed dynamics.  Our results extend the theoretical understanding of both optimal transport and network dynamics. We propose two principled algorithms for solving the multi-commodity problem.  Their similar computational complexity significantly improves upon gradient descent or Monte Carlo methods, making the model scalable to large datasets and the only computationally viable optimization alternative for large-scale problems.",
        "Deep learning has revolutionized visual classification [17, 39, 21, 32], achieving remarkable success thanks to large-scale labeled datasets [5]. While public datasets like ImageNet [9] enable superhuman performance on common object recognition, practical applications often involve categories with scarce data, such as medical images. This data scarcity limits the generalization of current vision systems, necessitating methods that can generalize to novel classes with limited labeled samples.  Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) addresses this challenge by recognizing novel categories in a target domain using few labeled samples.  Unlike general few-shot learning (FSL), where source and novel datasets come from the same domain, CDFSL involves distinct source and target domains with different feature distributions [52].\n\nWhile FSL has seen promising advancements [44, 14, 37, 38, 11, 35, 46], state-of-the-art (SOTA) meta-learning based FSL methods struggle in CDFSL scenarios due to poor generalization and domain shift [6, 16].  Existing approaches have attempted to address this. Some introduce feature-transformation layers to simulate diverse feature distributions during training [41], but require extensive multi-domain data.  Others combine FSL and domain adaptation objectives [50], but assume identical label sets between domains, limiting their applicability.  Traditional transfer learning, where a feature extractor pre-trained on the source dataset is fine-tuned on the target dataset with few labeled samples, has shown superior performance in CDFSL benchmarks [16].  Building on this, methods like eigenvalue regularization [27] aim to mitigate negative knowledge transfer.\n\nOur work focuses on the crucial role of generalization capability in cross-domain representation learning.  A strong feature extractor in the source domain doesn't guarantee good performance in the target domain due to differing feature distributions.  Overfitting to the source domain can lead to less discriminative or inseparable feature embeddings in the target domain (illustrated in Figure 1).  Conversely, a less perfect source domain extractor may generalize better and yield more discriminative target domain embeddings.  Figure 1(a) and (c) depict a less-generalized feature extractor performing well on the source but poorly on the target, while Figure 1(b) and (d) show a more generalized extractor with better target domain performance.\n\nInspired by the potential of multi-task learning for improved generalization [22], we propose a noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder (NSAE).  This approach leverages several key advantages.  First, it inherits the generalization benefits of supervised autoencoders [22] by jointly predicting input labels and reconstructing inputs. Second, inspired by the generalization-enhancing effects of noise injection during training [33, 2, 1], we treat reconstructed images as noisy inputs and feed them back into the system for further classification.  This avoids the need for handcrafted noise.  Third, a two-step fine-tuning procedure further adapts the model to the target domain.  Initial unsupervised tuning focuses on reconstructing novel class images, followed by supervised classification fine-tuning.  Theoretical analysis based on inter-class correlation (ICC) supports our intuition about generalization in CDFSL (Figure 1).  Finally, our method is easily integrated with existing transfer learning methods to boost performance.\n\nOur key contributions are:\n\n*  The first application of a supervised autoencoder framework to enhance generalization in few-shot learning.\n*  The novel use of reconstructed images as noisy inputs for enhanced generalization, coupled with a two-step fine-tuning procedure for improved target domain adaptation.\n*  Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbone architectures, and loss functions demonstrating the efficacy and robustness of our framework in CDFSL.",
        "Recommender Systems (RS) have recently become crucial tools to address information overload in various domains with abundant data, such as e-commerce, education, finance, and health (Zhu et al., 2021). Among the key technologies within RS, Collaborative Filtering (CF) has achieved significant success due to its domain-independent nature and simplicity in explanation. CF aims to extract user and item representations from their interactions to predict user preferences and recommend items (Chen et al., 2022). However, as the number of users and items grows exponentially, CF-based recommendation methods often face high time and space costs (Qi et al., 2021a).\n\nFortunately, hash-based CF (Hash-CF) approaches (Chen et al., 2018) have shown promise in compressing data and speeding up computations for recommendations involving billions of users and items (Shan et al., 2018). In large-scale recommendation scenarios, Hash-CF encodes high-dimensional real-valued vectors into compact one-hot codes (hash representations) to achieve significant storage compression and accelerate recommendations through bitwise operations like XOR. This enables a more efficient recommendation model even with massive datasets.\n\nHowever, existing Hash-CF approaches encounter challenges related to the learned hash representations. Firstly, there is a challenge in optimizing discrete hash representations, as obtaining such representations typically involves the sign function, leading to a complex mixed-binary-integer optimization problem that is NP-hard (Wang et al., 2018). A potential solution involves replacing the sign function with a continuous relaxation, such as the tanh function, to learn deterministic hash representations in an end-to-end manner. However, this approach lacks robustness due to a lack of noise tolerance consideration. Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2014) offers a probabilistic approach to model features as distributions, accommodating uncertainty in data for robust recommendation (Liang et al., 2018). \n\nAnother challenge is how to preserve semantic information in discrete representations. Hash representations inherently lack the ability to convey semantic information as effectively as real-valued representations. Although existing Hash-CF approaches attempt to control quantization loss, they struggle to maintain semantic consistency between real-valued and hash representations, resulting in the loss of crucial semantic information necessary for accurate recommendations.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel Hash-CF recommendation approach, termed HCFRec, that generates compact yet informative hash representations for effective and efficient recommendations. Our proposal consists of two main components based on the VAE framework to ensure robust generalization capability. For the first challenge, the hash representation generation component models user and item features as real-valued representations following a simple normal distribution.",
        "Correlation analysis is often the first step in understanding complex systems data [1], employed across diverse fields from financial economics and psychology to bioinformatics, neuroscience, and climate science.  Correlation matrices, which capture pairwise similarity of often temporally evolving signals, describe system interactions within these fields.  Existing methods for analyzing this data are abundant.\n\nEstablished techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) [2] and factor analysis (FA) [3, 4] extract a small number of interpretable components. For example, PCA might reveal a global market trend in stock market data or spatio-temporal patterns of air pressure in atmospheric data.  Markowitz's portfolio theory in mathematical finance [5, 6], another key method, minimizes the variance of financial returns for a given expected return. Relatedly, random matrix theory has been a crucial tool for analyzing economic and other correlation matrix data for decades [6].\n\nNumerous newer methods have also emerged.  These include detrended cross-correlation analysis [7][8][9], correlation dependency (defined as the difference between partial and Pearson correlation coefficients) [10, 11], identifying optimal paths within correlation matrix data [12], and early warning signals for anticipating abrupt changes in dynamical systems, including networked systems [13][14][15]. Energy landscape analysis, particularly used in neuroscience [16, 17], also offers another approach.\n\nOver the past two decades, network science and graph theory have provided powerful tools for analyzing correlational data.  A correlation matrix can be mapped onto a correlation network, where nodes represent elements and edge weights reflect correlation strength.  Correlation network analysis aims to extract information like interaction patterns or node rankings. Ideally, this approach leverages network science concepts in a way that generates insights beyond those provided by standard correlation matrix methods like PCA.  While correlation doesn't necessarily imply a direct physical connection or interaction, correlation matrices often serve as a readily available proxy when direct connection data is scarce.",
        "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is rapidly emerging as a crucial framework that utilizes interconnected sensors, actuators, and devices not just for automation but also to enhance interconnectivity within the industrial ecosystem. This interconnectedness aids in decision-making processes by facilitating seamless communication between different parts of the network. Unlike traditional data collection methods, IIoT focuses on streamlining operations and improving communication between network components, driving digital transformation, automation, and efficiency in various sectors such as water, manufacturing, energy, infrastructure management, and healthcare.\n\nAuthors Keivan Faghih Niresi and Olga Fink are affiliated with the Intelligent Maintenance and Operations Systems (IMOS) Lab at EPFL, Switzerland, and can be reached via email at keivan.faghihniresi@epfl.ch and olga.fink@epfl.ch. Meanwhile, Hugo Bissig and Henri Baumann are associated with the Swiss Federal Institute of Metrology (METAS).\n\nThe reliability of IIoT heavily relies on the quality of data gathered from sensor networks integrated into complex systems. Challenges in achieving highly reliable measurements in IIoT include issues such as the high costs of installing numerous sensors, retrofitting existing systems with sensors, sparse sensor deployment, malfunctioning sensors, energy constraints related to deploying dense sensor networks, and harsh environmental conditions that may impede sensor installation. To address these challenges effectively, computational sensing techniques can be employed to unleash the full potential of intelligent systems powered by IIoT.\n\nSoft sensing, a promising method, enhances the capabilities of physical sensors, improves data quality, and boosts the effectiveness of IIoT in monitoring complex system operations. Soft sensors, acting as mathematical models, estimate desired variables in new locations using data collected from physical sensors, particularly in places where physical sensors are unavailable. Soft sensing primarily employs two approaches: data-driven and physics-based modeling.\n\nWhile traditional methods like the Kalman filter have been used for model parameter estimation, the limitations of these approaches, such as presuming linearity in system and observation model equations, can hinder their effectiveness in real-world industrial processes characterized by nonlinearity. Alternative methods like the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), squareroot UKF (SR-UKF), and extended Kalman filter (EKF) have been developed to address these challenges. Data-driven soft sensing approaches, utilizing statistical and machine learning techniques, offer effective solutions for scenarios where physical processes pose challenges for state estimation.\n\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as effective tools in capturing complex interactions and interdependencies among nodes in sensor networks. Despite their potential, research gaps remain, particularly in scenarios with limited sensor coverage and challenges in interpretability and generalizability. Integrating physics principles with GNNs is a promising approach to enhance the interpretability, accuracy, and generalization of soft sensors.\n\nTo bridge these gaps, a novel approach is proposed to integrate physics principles into GNNs by augmenting graph structures with additional nodes derived from physics-based equations. This augmentation aims to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of soft sensor estimation by providing crucial information for inferring unobserved variables.\n\nA case study of district heating networks is used to evaluate this methodology, focusing on estimating pressure and temperature values across the network using existing mass flow rate sensors. The study aims to improve the efficiency and safety of district heating networks by leveraging characteristic parameters of the network's components to estimate virtual sensors beyond raw sensor measurements. The proposed physics-enhanced model for soft sensing demonstrates improved performance, even in scenarios with noisy sensor readings and inaccuracies in physical parameters.\n\nIn summary, the contributions of this work include proposing a novel soft sensing model based on physics-enhanced GNNs, conducting experiments to evaluate its performance, and creating a new dataset for district heating networks.",
        "Deep latent variable models have started to outperform conventional baselines on lossy compression of images [4, 7, 25, 14, 15, 24, 23, 33, 36], video [19, 8, 21, 31, 37, 20, 27, 6, 12], and audio [39, 36]. Nearly all of these methods use a loss function of the form D + \u03b2R, where D measures distortion, R measures bitrate, and \u03b2 is a fixed tradeoff parameter. We refer to this approach as \u03b2-VAE [13], because this loss can be motivated from a variational perspective [12].\n\nA more natural way to target different regions of the R/D plane is to set a distortion constraint and find our model parameters through constrained optimization:\n\nEQUATION\n\nwhere \u03b8 refers to the joint parameters of the encoder, decoder, and prior, and c D is a distortion target. We can control the rate-distortion tradeoff by setting the distortion target value c D. Setting this value is more intuitive than setting \u03b2, as it is independent of the slope of the R/D curve and hence independent of model and hyperparameters. As a result, we can easily compare two different models trained with the same distortion constraint; as we have fixed the D axis we only have to look at the R performance for each model.\n\nDespite its popularity, \u03b2-VAE has several drawbacks. Firstly, setting \u03b2 to target a specific point in the R/D plane can be tricky. One can show that a model trained with a given \u03b2 should end up at that point on the R/D curve where the slope \u2202R \u2202D equals \u03b2 [1]. However, because the shape of the R/D curve depends on the model and hyperparameters, and because the R/D curve can be very steep or flat in the low or high bitrate regime, choosing \u03b2 can be difficult.\n\nSecondly, in order to compare models, it is not sufficient to train one instance of each model because the converged models would likely differ in both rate and distortion, which yields inconclusive results unless one model dominates the other on both metrics. Instead, to compare models, we need to train both at several \u03b2 values to generate R/D curves that can be compared, which is computationally costly and slows down the research iteration cycle.\n\nNote that one could also minimize the distortion subject to a rate constraint. This is less straightforward as putting too much emphasis on the rate loss at the beginning of training can lead to posterior collapse [3, 11, 40, 28, 32].\n\nThere is a large literature on constrained optimization, but most of it does not consider stochastic optimization and is limited to convex loss functions.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\nThe use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image synthesis stands as one of the most remarkable achievements in the deep learning era, delivering impressive results across numerous generative-based tasks [3, 10, 16, 17, 19, 31, 44]. However, despite their success, GANs present significant challenges: they are difficult to train and susceptible to issues such as mode collapse, convergence failures, and vanishing gradients [38]. While extensive research has focused on addressing these challenges through heuristic modifications to generator and discriminator architectures and the development of improved training losses [1, 13, 24, 33], the generator itself remains largely a \"black-box\" with an unjustified architecture and unclear operational principles.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the sparse modeling literature [9], we propose a novel interpretation that illuminates the architecture of image generators and introduces a meaningful and effective regularization framework. Our approach interprets generators as implicitly leveraging sparse models, particularly the Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) and its Multi-Layered (ML-CSC) variant [2, 5, 11, 14, 27, 29, 35-37] (detailed in Sec. 2). This perspective offers potential insights into the generator's intermediate mappings and leads to a general model-based approach for regularizing image generators that can be readily applied across various architectures. Through extensive experimentation with diverse GAN architectures, from basic to state-of-the-art implementations, we demonstrate substantial performance improvements.\n\nBeyond GANs, we extend our findings to other image generator neural networks, specifically applying our proposed regularizations to the Deep Image Prior (DIP) algorithm [40] for image denoising. Our experiments in this domain further validate our approach, showing performance gains in both image synthesis and restoration tasks.\n\nTo summarize, this work examines deep neural networks serving as image generators, with the following key contributions:\n\u2022 We propose a novel sparse modeling interpretation of image generators for better understanding them.",
        "Intonation drift is an important topic in analyzing unaccompanied singing and has been discussed in MIR literature from various angles. In order to study the drift, we need to assume a reference pitch, and then measure the deviation from that reference pitch in the course of a segment or performance. Intonation drift happens both in choirs and solo singing, and it usually occurs in the downward direction. Harmonic progression has been mentioned as one of the causes of drift in choir. In this paper, we consider drift in solo singing. Our main goal is to computationally measure the drift in the course of a performance.\n\nThe methodology is discussed in sections 2 to 5. In order to explain the detail, we have used an example of a performance with a duration of 5 minutes and 32 seconds (Example 1). It starts with an introduction for about 48 seconds, before the main part begins at the 52-second mark. The whole piece consists of sixteen sentences, which are separated with long silences.",
        "Measuring the relatedness between two words is a common task.  Automated approaches generally fall into three categories [22]: corpus-based methods, knowledge-based methods, and hybrid methods. Corpus-based methods leverage large text corpora and analyze word co-occurrence, as exemplified in [47].  Knowledge-based methods rely on structured resources like knowledge graphs or ontologies, such as in [13]. Hybrid methods combine these approaches, as seen in [38].  Due to the abundance of textual data and advancements in natural language processing, corpus-based methods have been extensively studied. Knowledge-based methods, the focus of this paper, depend on the availability and quality of a knowledge base. These methods require mapping words to knowledge base resources, bridging the gap between linguistic and knowledge-based representations.\n\nOntologies have become prominent knowledge representation tools, particularly for advanced reasoning, since the rise of the Semantic Web.  However, they have limitations: (i) creation and maintenance are often manual and costly; (ii) general-purpose ontologies, like WordNet, primarily contain hierarchical relations ( *is a* and *part of*) and offer limited relation types.  Note that similarity, a key concept in clustering [6], is also fundamental. Clustering, which partitions data into similar groups, has been widely studied, for instance, in ontology matching [10] to handle large-scale ontologies by decomposing instances into smaller clusters. Clustering in semantic spaces is also used for tasks like image collection summarization and self-supervision [54].  Resim (Resource Similarity), a measure for evaluating semantic similarity of DBpedia resources, was introduced, and subsequently, a more general relatedness approach was proposed in [44], which is one of the ten methods examined in this work (see Sections 5.2 and A.2.2).\n\nThis paper specifically addresses semantic relatedness, rather than the narrower concept of semantic similarity.  Domain-specific semantic relatedness measures and datasets (e.g., biomedicine [31]) are excluded because their effectiveness often doesn't generalize well [22].\n\nThe analyzed approaches are categorized into three groups based on their reliance on WordNet, Wikipedia, and Machine Learning, respectively.  Two recent methods, [39] and [2], deserve mention.  The former proposes a cross-domain item closeness measure for recommender systems based on co-occurrence counts of item-describing words on web pages. The latter evaluates semantic relatedness in unstructured data using fuzzy vectors and various relatedness techniques.  However, neither is knowledge-based and thus are excluded from our experiment.\n\n**WordNet:**  WordNet, a relatively simple knowledge graph modeling the English lexicon, primarily contains taxonomic (*is a*) and meronymic (*part of*) relations, with fewer thematic relations (see the next section on semantic relations). Several WordNet-based semantic relatedness approaches exist [57, 5, 33].  [57] addresses relatedness in labeled tree data using WordNet's hierarchical relations.  [5] introduces a method based on weighted paths defined by non-taxonomic relations, noting that most existing methods rely on *is a*.  [33] combines WordNet with word embedding for performance improvement.  [59] defines a random walk-based algorithm, but its evaluation is limited to WordNet. This paper excludes WordNet-specific approaches, focusing on methods applicable to larger, more relationally diverse knowledge graphs.\n\n**Wikipedia:**  Wikipedia, a vast online encyclopedia, can be viewed as a large corpus with entities described in natural language.  Extracting structured information requires substantial pre-processing.  The aforementioned WCG is a hybrid structure, not a strict *is a* taxonomy, designed for Wikipedia article management.  Research exploring the trade-off between natural language query expressivity and usability over Linked Data is valuable.  [20] presents the TREO system, combining entity search, TF-IDF [3], spreading activation, and WLM (analyzed in this work \u2013 see Sections 5.1 and A.1.1).  Similarly, [60] combines knowledge graphs and text similarity for complex question answering.  Wikipedia-focused approaches, often relying on corpus-based techniques and natural language processing beyond this work's scope, are excluded, except for WLM, analyzed in its RDF graph form.\n\n**Machine Learning:**  Recent work applies machine learning to semantic relatedness, encoding knowledge as numerical vectors (word embedding for text, graph embedding for graphs).  Examples of word embedding for semantic relatedness include [35, 52, 65].  [35] aims for better accuracy in various contexts. [52] represents keyphrases for similar news article retrieval. [65] constructs a relatedness graph for sentiment analysis. However, the first two are corpus-based, and the third is a hybrid approach, thus excluded from our experiment.  Regarding graph embedding, [50] proposes RDF2Vec using neural networks for Linked Data relatedness. This is arguably the first approach leveraging graph structure and neural language modeling for entity relatedness/similarity. However, computational cost remains a challenge [8], with experiments on even small datasets facing termination or memory issues.  Computational efficiency in this area is an open problem [7] beyond this paper's scope.  Finally, [26] applies machine learning to images representing words, investigating cognitive mechanisms using deep convolutional neural networks but doesn't involve graph-based knowledge, the focus of this work.",
        "Network slicing has been extensively researched in the context of 5G and beyond to support various network services in terms of cost efficiency, flexibility, and assurance. The increasing disintegration of network elements with precise controllability can result in volatile network dynamics across various aspects, such as the admission and departure of slices within short time frames. Consequently, the allocation of radio resources to dynamic network slices becomes even more challenging.\n\nThe issue of resource allocation in network slicing has been thoroughly explored within individual cell scenarios, where allocations are primarily optimized assuming prior knowledge of the resource demands of slices. Previous studies have developed solutions by creating analytical closed-form models and addressing the network slicing problem through constrained nonlinear optimization techniques. In a notable work by authors [3], the problem of slicewise resource allocation was initially formulated and streamlined by determining the upper and lower bounds of network utility using the Lagrangian method. Subsequently, a sub-optimal solution was derived using a greedy algorithm. While this simplified model is effective, it is tailored to specific slice configurations. In another study [4], authors introduced a flexible slice deployment solution with dynamic slice configurations, formulating a slice model with adjustable parameters and solving resource partition through an optimization process. However, recent findings [5], [6] suggest that these approximate models may not accurately represent the diverse demands and performance of slices.\n\nWith recent advancements in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been increasingly explored to address complex allocation problems in dynamic mobile networks. Zhou et al. [7] developed a multi-agent RL framework based on Q-Learning to determine optimal joint resource allocation through a coordinated Q-table, which mitigates inter-slice resource constraints. However, this solution may not be scalable for large state and action spaces. In a prior study [8], coordinated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was employed to tackle high-dimensional continuous action spaces and complex resource optimization in network slicing, embedding inter-slice resource constraints within the neural network architecture. Nevertheless, this solution was specifically trained for a fixed network scenario and may not easily adapt to different slice setups in terms of slice type and number. Liu et al. [9] proposed an approach that combines DRL and an optimization process for slicing resource allocation in a single-cell scenario, yet lacking discussion on generalizing the solution to various multi-cell network scenarios with flexible slice configurations.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm named Integrated Deep Learning and Lagrangian Method (IDLA) that optimizes slicing resource allocation and can be adapted to arbitrary slice combinations under time-varying dynamics. The key contributions of this work include:\n\u2022 Introduction of a novel framework that integrates deep learning models, which possess approximation capabilities, and constrained optimization methods, known for strong generalization, allowing for generalization to arbitrary slice combinations. By leveraging the derivatives of the slice utility function approximated by the DNN model, we design a Lagrangian method to determine optimal resource allocation on a per-slice basis while adhering to inter-slice resource constraints.\n\u2022 Evaluation of the proposed algorithm in a system-level network simulator, showcasing numerical results indicating that our algorithm achieves near-optimal Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction and promising generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art solutions, including widely used DRL approaches.",
        "Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3-D printing, has experienced rapid growth in popularity and market share due to its ability to create complex geometries with engineering properties that often meet or exceed those of conventionally manufactured parts, while significantly reducing overhead costs [1] [2] [3].  One such AM process, Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), builds three-dimensional parts layer by layer from metal powder (Fig. 1). The PBF process involves a three-stage build cycle: 1) spreading a thin layer of powder over a base plate or previously deposited layer, 2) selectively melting the powder into the desired pattern using a high-powered laser or electron beam (e-beam), and 3) lowering the build platform to allow for the next layer of powder.\n\nDespite its advantages, PBF presents challenges.  Parts manufactured via PBF often exhibit high levels of residual stresses [5] [6] [7], porosity [8] [9] [10], and anisotropy in material properties [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]. These defects stem directly from the thermal management of the PBF process.  Currently, PBF machines operate in open-loop, with the irradiated energy, *u*, dictated by a G-Code schedule [15].  The parameters governing this schedule are determined through operator experience, heuristic design-of-experiment procedures [16], or computationally intensive predictive models [17].  Feedback control of the thermal management process could significantly improve the quality of PBF-manufactured parts.\n\nWhile the need for improved thermal management in PBF is recognized, the controllability and observability of the process\u2014fundamental criteria for modern control synthesis\u2014remain unestablished. This paper addresses this fundamental gap.  Our analysis considers both current and emerging thermal actuation and sensing hardware capabilities, without regard for computational constraints during model construction.  The goal is to establish a controls theoretic foundation for PBF, enabling the application of modern control tools such as multivariable robust controllers, state estimators, and fault detection schemes to this important and evolving manufacturing technology.  Throughout this paper, we use the nomenclature defined in Table 1.",
        "Crowd counting has garnered significant attention due to its crucial role in applications like video surveillance, public security, and even in mitigating the spread of viruses like COVID-19.  It serves as a foundational technique for higher-level crowd behavior analysis algorithms. However, crowd counting faces significant challenges, primarily scale variations, diverse crowd distributions, and background clutter.  As illustrated in Figure 1, the perspective distortion introduces variations in head sizes within a single image, and crowd distribution patterns change drastically across different scenes.  Background clutter, like trees and buildings, can be easily mistaken for dense crowd regions, leading to overestimation in density maps, a problem analyzed in several crowd counting reviews [1, 2]. Some CNN-based methods are particularly susceptible to this issue.\n\nFigure 1 showcases these challenges in the ShanghaiTech dataset. The red rectangles highlight the varying head sizes, while the green rectangles indicate clutter resembling crowded areas. The figure presents the original image, the ground-truth density map, and the predicted density map from the CSRNet method [3].\n\nExisting methods address scale variation using multi-column networks [4-7] with varying kernel sizes to extract multi-scale features.  However, these architectures tend to be computationally expensive and contain redundant information, as noted in [3].  Other approaches employ scale-aware modules [8, 9] inspired by the Inception architecture, incorporating multiple convolution kernels with different receptive fields within a single-column network. While more efficient, these modules require careful selection of dilation rates, making it difficult to capture the full continuum of scales.\n\nThis paper proposes a multi-scale context aggregation network (MSCANet) based on an encoder-decoder architecture to address these challenges.  Observing that small objects in crowded scenes benefit from neighboring and multi-scale contextual information, we introduce a dense context-aware module (DCAM).  DCAM densely connects dilated kernels with varying receptive fields, capturing richer contextual information and scale diversity compared to existing scale-aware modules.\n\nFurthermore, inspired by UNet [15] and FPN [16], MSCANet incorporates a hierarchical attention-guided decoder. This decoder integrates encoder features hierarchically, refining the density map.",
        "The sixth generation (6G) of wireless mobile networks is anticipated to deliver key performance indicators including 1 Gbps data rates per user, ultra-low latency (1 ms or less), massive device connectivity, and ultra-high reliability (99.99999%). Additionally, 6G is set to enhance programmability and quality of service (QoS) by incorporating technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), multi-access edge computing (MEC), in-network computing, dynamic orchestration, and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI). These advanced features make 6G networks a complex infrastructure that presents numerous opportunities to integrate non-traditional resiliency capabilities for networked applications.\n\nVarious systems designed to safeguard human lives are increasingly reliant on communication networks. These systems include smart city infrastructures, smart agriculture solutions, power grids, autonomous vehicle traffic systems, tactical defense networks, and emergency response systems. Any disruption or delay in communication poses a significant threat to human lives. For instance, a delay in reporting a frequency drift in a smart grid network could lead to power generation inefficiencies and potentially trigger a catastrophic grid collapse.\n\nWhile current network generations typically fulfill their objectives under normal conditions, we anticipate that 6G-enabled systems, with intelligently leveraged advanced features, will have the capacity to sustain mission objectives even during disruptions. Resiliency should be a foundational element in the design and architecture of 6G systems to address a wide array of adverse events and failure scenarios. In the context of 6G systems, resiliency is defined as the ability to endure, adapt gracefully to, and swiftly recover from malicious attacks, component failures, and natural or human-induced disruptions.\n\nThe conventional method for ensuring resiliency involves replicating components so that if one instance fails, the others can handle incoming requests. However, this approach is limited to homogeneous stack environments with similar hardware, operating systems, and libraries. This work proposes to restore critical functionality by adapting it onto available non-homogeneous resources within the device-to-edge-to-cloud continuum of 6G networks.\n\nWe envision an adaptive resiliency framework called La R\u00e9sistance 6G (LR6G) network. To illustrate, consider a scenario where a critical service hosted on the C-RAN is disrupted by a security attack such as reflective DDoS. In this situation, leveraging small IoT devices may offer a resilient solution to combat the adversary within the Edge-to-Cloud network.\n\nUnlike 5G networks, LR6G network is service-centric and system-oriented, expanding beyond network functions. LR6G possesses distinct characteristics:\n1) It consolidates available resources, including network and storage equipment and IoT devices, into a unified resource pool without losing visibility into their individual capabilities.\n2) It transforms diverse resources into a unified, programmable platform to achieve desired performance and security objectives.\n3) It can segment functionality to fit individual resource constraints, while also proactively identifying potential vulnerabilities across the system.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section II provides background on resiliency strategies for distributed functions, Section III introduces the proposed LR6G architecture, and Section IV presents the conclusions.",
        "Spurious correlations are unintended associations or biases that models learn between input images and target labels. These often arise from factors such as data selection biases (Torralba and Efros, 2011; Jabri et al., 2016). The frequent co-occurrence of certain features, like foreground objects or backgrounds, with a higher than average likelihood, can lead models to focus on non-predictive, spuriously correlated features rather than the core predictive ones. ASPIRE, a novel method, automatically detects these non-predictive features for each class (e.g., indoor backgrounds for small dogs) and generates synthetic images without them (e.g., small dogs in an outdoor background). These new images can be added to the training set to develop a more robust image classifier. For example, in the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al., 2009), most images labeled as \"Dog Sled\" also feature a dog. Consequently, classifiers trained on ImageNet often fail to identify a dog sled without a dog.\n\nInstances of a class in the training set with co-occurring spurious features are commonly known as majority groups. Conversely, atypical instances without these features are known as minority groups. Deep neural networks trained on such datasets generally perform poorly on minority groups due to their scarcity, leading to significant performance degradation in tests or real-world scenarios involving domain shifts (Sagawa et al., 2019; Arjovsky et al., 2019). Learning these correlations negatively impacts various Computer Vision (CV) applications, including visual question-answering (Liu et al., 2023c), retrieval (Kong et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023), and classification (Liu et al., 2021a). Teaching deep neural networks to represent data meaningfully while avoiding over-reliance on spurious features remains a central challenge in CV.\n\nDuring the training of over-parameterized deep neural networks, multiple solutions with the same loss values exist at any stage. The optimizer typically gravitates towards a solution with lesser complexity, often learning shortcuts (Wilson et al., 2017; Valle-Perez et al., 2018; Arpit et al., 2017; Kalimeris et al., 2019). When faced with co-occurring spurious features, the optimizer may prefer them since they usually require less complexity than the desired semantic signals (Bruna and Mallat, 2013; Bruna et al., 2015; Brendel and Bethge, 2019; Khani and Liang, 2021).\n\nDeveloping classifiers robust to spurious correlations is an active research area (Sagawa* et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a; Kirichenko et al., 2023). Researchers often assume annotated data for minority groups exists within the training dataset. The prevailing principle is that improved generalization on minority groups can result in a more robust classifier. Despite extensive research indicating that more data can enhance generalization, little effort has been made to leverage this for building robust classifiers. It is impractical to manually collect and label minority group images for large-scale datasets. In complex datasets like Hard ImageNet, beyond CelebA (Liu et al., 2015) and Waterbirds (Welinder et al., 2010), a single class may have multiple spuriously correlated features.",
        "Exploring the realm of egocentric vision (first-person view), the pursuit of refining 3D hand pose estimation stands as pivotal for understanding human activity. This quest not only paves the way for new developments in human-computer interaction (HCI) [31, 34, 38] but also facilitates imitation learning [8, 13, 37]. Additionally, it elevates the immersive experience in augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) to unprecedented levels [15, 33]. Recent advancements in AR/VR headsets have made egocentric data more prevalent [5, 10], leading to a growing demand for estimating 3D hand poses from egocentric viewpoints.\n\nIn recent years, numerous networks with diverse structures have emerged to enhance 3D hand pose estimation performance [7, 39, 44]. However, most existing methods are limited to a single-view setting, which although convenient, comes with drawbacks such as a restricted field-of-view and depth ambiguity. To tackle these issues, one potential solution is to incorporate an additional camera to widen the field-of-view and reduce depth ambiguity by capturing the hand shape from a different angle. Moreover, the integration of multiple cameras aligns with industry trends, evident in the latest AR/VR headsets like the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest, which feature multiple egocentric cameras. Consequently, a shift towards multi-view settings in hand pose estimation is inevitable, driven by technological advancements and industry trends.\n\nPresently, several studies have focused on hand pose estimation under multi-view settings [4, 12, 19]. These methods typically process input images from multiple views concurrently, employing a feature fusion module to generate final predictions [22, 41]. However, existing approaches have significant limitations, such as the requirement for costly multi-view labels during training and the necessity to use the same camera parameters during testing as those used in training. In contrast, our proposed method offers a fresh approach that enables adaptation of a single-view estimator to a dual-view setup without the need for multi-view labels or specific camera parameters. By utilizing a pre-trained estimator and unlabeled dual-view inputs, our method can adapt to arbitrary dual-view setups, allowing for flexibility in camera configurations.\n\nExpanding on these advancements, we introduce a novel unsupervised Single-to-Dual-view adaptation framework (S2DHand) for egocentric 3D hand pose estimation. This framework leverages stereo constraints, including cross-view consensus and transformation invariance between camera coordinate systems, to refine pseudo-labels and enhance model accuracy. The cross-view consensus is utilized through an attention-based merging module, while the invariance of transformation is employed via a rotation-guided refinement module.\n\nOur method is evaluated by adapting a pre-trained estimator to various dual-camera pairs placed in different poses. Evaluation across in-dataset and cross-dataset scenarios demonstrates significant enhancements over state-of-the-art adaptation methods. The key contributions of this work include proposing an unsupervised single-to-dual-view adaptation solution, introducing a pseudo-label-based strategy for adaptation, and achieving substantial improvements for arbitrarily placed camera pairs under different settings.",
        "Fashion, a cornerstone of human experience, has burgeoned into a multi-hundred-billion-dollar industry in the US alone.  The rise of online shopping has fueled a demand for sophisticated fashion-understanding systems, particularly for outfit recommendation.  Recent years have witnessed significant progress in fashion-related research, encompassing clothing attribute prediction, landmark detection [11, 21], fashion recommendation [5, 8, 24], clothing item retrieval [10, 22], clothing parsing [1, 4], and outfit recommendation [2, 7, 12, 19].\n\nThis paper focuses on outfit recommendation. An outfit comprises items from various fine-grained categories (e.g., sweater, jeans, boots, school bag) that exhibit visual aesthetic harmony.  Effective outfit recommendation necessitates learning compatibility [2, 3, 13, 19, 20]\u2014how multiple visual items interact\u2014rather than simply identifying similarity between individual items.\n\nExisting outfit recommendation approaches fall into three main categories.  The first [7, 13] treats an outfit as a set, training a binary classifier to determine outfit compatibility based on concatenated item features (Figure 1a).  Due to the limitations of simple concatenation in modeling inter-item relationships, this approach generally yields the poorest performance.  The second [3, 20] minimizes the sum of distances between all item pairs in a compatibility space (Figure 1b).  This approach often suffers from the \"ill-triangle\" problem: two incompatible items might be deemed compatible if both are compatible with a third item. While an extension [19] incorporates \"type\" information, it requires learning type embedding matrices for every type pair, incurring an inefficient O(n\u00b2) time complexity for *n* clothing types.  The third approach [2, 14] treats an outfit as a predefined item sequence (Figure 1c), modeling compatibility with an order-dependent LSTM.  Performance degrades significantly when the outfit order changes.  Furthermore, existing systems often prioritize visual aesthetics and metadata like item descriptions. While useful for describing image features, this metadata is less effective for compatibility learning.  Coarse category information (e.g., tops, bottoms, shoes) is used to define sequential outfits [2, 14], with each timestep corresponding to a predefined coarse category.  Training solely on coarse or fine categories lacks flexibility, as a query item's category might be coarse while the model is trained on fine categories.  The literature lacks consideration for both category types.  To meet customer needs, both fine-grained and coarse categories are essential. For example, two customers with the same T-shirt might prefer different pants (jeans or sweatpants) rather than simply a \"bottom.\"  Conversely, a customer with a T-shirt might desire any type of \"bottom.\"  To incorporate both category types into compatibility learning and enhance recommendation flexibility, we introduce the concept of a *tuple*: a fashion item paired with its category (coarse or fine).  Consequently, we extend item compatibility learning to tuple compatibility learning.\n\nTo facilitate tuple compatibility learning and address existing limitations, we propose the Mixed Category Attention Net (MCAN). MCAN treats an outfit as a combination of item-category tuples and learns their compatibility.  Given a partial tuple sequence, MCAN predicts the next item via an integrated Item Prediction Layer (IPL). If the next category is specified, the predicted item will belong to that category; otherwise, a Category Prediction Layer (CPL) predicts the next category. By incorporating category sequences, MCAN offers versatile recommendation capabilities.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, enhancing readability while maintaining the academic tone and technical accuracy:\n\n# Temporal Data Analysis: Balancing Recent and Historical Information\n\n## Introduction\n\nA fundamental challenge in temporal data analysis is determining how to appropriately weight information from recent versus distant past events. We address this question by building upon the framework of rescoring rules (Webster et al., 1982), a well-established methodology from actigraphy research.\n\nMoving window algorithms (MWAs) have been extensively employed in actigraphy studies to predict sleep status (Webster et al., 1982; Cole et al., 1992; Sadeh et al., 1994; Oakley 1997; Sazonov et al., 2004; Palotti et al., 2019). Webster et al. (1982) enhanced this approach by introducing post-hoc steps\u2014known as \"Webster's rescoring rules\"\u2014that incorporate long-term activity patterns into MWA outputs. These rules have become a standard benchmark for evaluating new sleep-wake classification methods (Jean-Louis et al., 2000; Benson et al., 2004; Palotti et al., 2019; Haghayegh et al., 2019, 2020).\n\n## Webster's Rescoring Rules\n\nThe general form of Webster's rescoring rules, with tuning parameters a, b, c, and d, can be expressed as:\n\n1. **Rule 1**: After detecting at least *a* continuous minutes scored as wake by the MWA, reclassify the subsequent *b* minutes as wake.\n\n2. **Rule 2**: Reclassify any sleep bout lasting *c* minutes or less as wake if it is bounded by at least *d* minutes of wake (both before and after).\n\nThese rules reflect two key insights:\n- Inactivity typically precedes sleep onset by several minutes\n- Brief sedentary periods don't necessarily indicate sleep, particularly when surrounded by extended periods of activity\n\nWebster et al. (1982) recommend applying multiple versions of each rule simultaneously:\n- Rule 1: (a, b) values of (4, 1), (10, 3), and (15, 4)\n- Rule 2: (c, d) values of (6, 10) and (10, 20)\n\n## Advantages and Limitations\n\nThe incorporation of long-term patterns through these rules can improve simple moving window models' accuracy to levels comparable with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Palotti et al., 2019). While RNNs excel at finding optimal representations of long-term patterns, Webster's rules offer superior interpretability, making it easier to identify when rescoring might be inappropriate.\n\nHowever, several limitations exist:\n\n1. The rules produce only binary classifications, not continuous probability estimates\n2. Their development appears heuristic rather than based on formal optimization\n3. The optimization process for parameters a, b, c, and d isn't clearly defined\n4.",
        "1. Attribute-based CTG (Zhang et al., 2022) focuses on generating sentences satisfying pre-specified attributes such as topic and sentiment, which remains extremely challenging in recent progress (Dathathri et al., 2020). Especially multi-attribute CTG, it is typically unsupervised since no example of a sentence with specified attributes could be obtained during training (Lample et al., 2019).\n\n2. Existing efforts for attribute-based CTG can be roughly divided into two types: fine-tuning and utilizing extra attribute classifiers. The first type usually finetunes a pre-trained language model (PLM) on the attribute-specific data (Ziegler et al., 2019), yet stores a full copy of the PLM for each desirable attribute. To partly address this issue, control codes are introduced to generate various styles of sentences with one PLM, such as keywords (Keskar et al., 2019) and numerical sequence (Lyu et al., 2021). However, re-training whole PLMs could be expensive (Yang and Klein, 2021) and they rarely attend to multi-attribute CTG. The second type introduces extra attribute classifiers to guide a PLM, such as back-propagating gradients of classifiers (Dathathri et al., 2020) or weighting output logits (Krause et al., 2021; Yang and Klein, 2021). Such a paradigm shows encouraging improvement, while the text fluency tends to decrease and inference time increase (Qian et al., 2022).\n\n3. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we propose a Text-attribute controller (Tailor) - a prompt-based approach to attribute-based CTG. The key idea is to represent each attribute as a pretrained continuous vector (hereinafter known as the single-attribute prompt) to control a fixed GPT-2 for single-attribute CTG, and effectively concatenate such single-attribute prompts as a whole for multi-attribute CTG. This allows Tailor to be easily expanded by training the corresponding attribute prompt if a new attribute emerges, while avoiding re-training the whole PLM.\n\n4. The single-attribute prompt is concatenated with the input prefix and then guides the generation of a fixed GPT-2 switch to a pre-specified attribute. More importantly, we experimentally find that such single-attribute prompts could be simply concatenated to generate sentences with multi attributes. However, this manner always suffers from fluency decrease and position sensitivity. To address these issues, the key lies in bridging the gap between the training and the testing stage.\n\n5. In detail, the single-attribute prompt only attends to itself in the attention matrix while training, since it is individually trained by the attribute-specific data. However, when it comes to the testing stage, the second prompt also attends to the first one in the concatenation, with the simultaneous change of the position-ids sequence. To fill this gap, Tailor introduces a Multi-Attribute Prompt mask (MAP mask) and a Reindexing Position-ids sequence (RP sequence) for the fixed GPT-2.\n\n6. MAP mask prevents distinct single-attribute prompts from cross-attention, and RP sequence ensures stable position-ids information for the PLM after swapping, by individually numbering each prompt. Inspired by the role of 'and' in connecting parallel phrases for natural sentences, Tailor further provides a training method that contains a continuous connector to connect two single-attribute prompts as a whole to multi-attribute CTG. As shown in Figure 1, the proposed Multi-Attribute Prompt connector (MAP connector) can be concatenated with any two single-attribute prompts and hint a GPT-2 to multi-attribute CTG.\n\n7. We experimentally reveal the combining ability of continuous prompts. Prompt Learning is a new paradigm in NLP summarized as \"Pre-train, Prompt and Predict\". In short, it can guide a single PLM to solve various downstream tasks by reformulating these tasks into a text-to-text manner. Recently, continuous prompts have attracted attention, which usually forms as a set of continuous task-specific vectors to the input.\n\n8. In this paper, we experimentally reveal the potential of combining continuous prompts to accomplish multi-attribute CTG.",
        "At every moment in time, the human brain responds dynamically to visual stimuli perceived through the eyes, which can be indirectly measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Understanding and categorizing specific patterns of brain activity in response to visual stimuli is vital in unraveling the mysteries of the human brain. One significant approach to achieving this is through inverse modeling, which involves reconstructing the observed image from the fMRI signal. Given the complexity of images, obtaining detailed pixel-level information presents challenges and is not always necessary. As a result, researchers have mainly focused on decoding the semantic content of images. On the other hand, fMRI encoding aims to predict the fMRI signal based on visual stimuli. However, decoding the fMRI signal poses several challenges: 1) Redundancy: Semantic information in the signal is sparsely distributed, with closely related elements showing high correlation, indicating redundancy in the fMRI signal. 2) Instability: The fMRI signal is influenced significantly by changes in domain, meaning signals from one person or scanner may not apply to decoding signals from another person or scanner. 3) Insufficiency: In practical scenarios, the availability of image-signal pairs is limited, making it difficult to utilize deep learning methods that typically rely on large training sets for understanding fMRI data. Recent studies have attempted to decode fMRI signals using pre-trained generative models such as Instance-Conditional GAN, diffusion models, masked autoencoders, and CLIP, among others. Although these methods have shown impressive results in generating high-quality images, they face challenges in ensuring semantic consistency with fMRI signals and reliability in the presence of noise.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel framework that addresses the challenges of fMRI signals through joint decoding and encoding tasks. Our framework comprises several key components. First, we introduce an encoder-decoder architecture specifically designed for fMRI signals and images to learn a dense latent representation space for each modality, tackling signal redundancy effectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the advantage of training these architectures independently, eliminating the need for paired fMRI-image data and overcoming data insufficiency. Despite the instability of fMRI signals across individuals, our framework successfully compresses these signals into a unified latent space using a shared encoder. By leveraging self-supervised training principles, we train our architecture to construct a dense latent space without extra supervision. We propose a lightweight alignment module to link the latent spaces learned from fMRI and images, tailored to individual characteristics to address signal instability. Through this alignment, we can assess the reliability of both neural encoding and decoding models by reconstructing images from fMRI signals.\n\nThe Latent Embedding Alignment (LEA) framework we present is tailored for fMRI decoding and encoding, incorporating separate encoder-decoder architectures for fMRI signals and images, along with an alignment module for transforming between the latent spaces. Our framework supports image-fMRI-image reconstruction, ensuring the reliability of both encoding and decoding models. Extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of LEA in fMRI decoding and encoding.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n- Facilitating the training of encoder-decoder architectures for specialized fMRI signal and image latent spaces.\n- Establishing a connection between these latent spaces to enable fMRI decoding and encoding within the unified LEA framework.\n- Demonstrating the superior performance of LEA through rigorous validation on multiple benchmark datasets, highlighting its efficacy and advancements.",
        "Semantic textual similarity (STS) and information retrieval (IR) tasks have been principal measures for tracking the progress of dense representation models (Agirre et al., 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016; Cer et al., 2017; Thakur et al., 2021).  While STS remains a common evaluation metric in sentence representation research, it is known for its limited real-world applicability (Neelakantan et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2023b), inherent ambiguity (Deshpande et al., 2023), and performance orthogonality with IR and other downstream tasks (Reimers et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2023a).\n\nIn the era of large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Neelakantan et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023) has become a favored alternative to standard end-to-end generative language models (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). This shift is driven by LLMs' inherent weaknesses regarding factual errors stemming from hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023), outdated knowledge (Vu et al., 2023), limitations with long-tailed knowledge (Kandpal et al., 2023; Malaviya et al., 2023), and reasoning failures, such as in logical deduction (Berglund et al., 2023).\n\nRAG is employed differently across various NLP tasks:\n\n* **Knowledge-Intensive Tasks:** RAG retrieves up-to-date and reliable knowledge references (Vu et al., 2023; Malaviya et al., 2023), which serve as new prompts for LLMs to extract information and formulate responses. This mitigates hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023) and reduces the need for frequent LLM fine-tuning.\n* **Reasoning-Dependent Tasks:** RAG fetches the most relevant chunks from extensive inputs to guide LLM focus, for example, in multi-hop question answering where reasoning across multiple documents is required.  Reasoning with such long contexts is challenging even for LLMs with extended context windows, and impossible for those with shorter ones (Xu et al., 2023).\n\nDespite the promise of dense retrievers for knowledge-intensive tasks, they struggle to retrieve reliable and cite-worthy references (Malaviya et al., 2023) compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs used independently (OpenAI, 2023). This highlights a weakness in retrievers' ability to assist LLMs.  This discrepancy is amplified in reasoning-intensive tasks, where RAG often shows inconsistent gains or even performance degradation compared to standalone LLMs (Bai et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023).\n\nGiven the complex role of dense representation models in the LLM era, accurately assessing their advanced language understanding capabilities is crucial.",
        "Periodic behaviors frequently arise in the dynamical analysis of systems, especially in complex models that depict natural phenomena like epidemics or population dynamics. These models typically involve some intrinsic delay in their description, which is the focus of our current discussion.\n\nWhile the study of periodic solutions in ordinary differential equations is well-established in terms of computation, continuation, and bifurcation (refer to the MatCont package [2] as an example of the latest advancements), the theory and computational tools for delay equations are still evolving. DDE-Biftool [1, 22] is a significant reference for delay differential equations, utilizing methodologies based on previous work [20] that extend traditional piecewise orthogonal collation methods used in ordinary differential equations (refer to [4, 5]). However, when tackling more intricate systems that involve renewal, Volterra integral, or integro-differential equations, there is a noticeable deficiency [12, 13].\n\nThe motivation behind this work stemmed from the necessity to address this gap by extending numerical collocation techniques [20] to Renewal Equations (REs). Beyond the practical aspects of implementation and computation, considerable effort was directed towards sourcing relevant literature for error analysis and convergence. Recognizing the scarcity of comprehensive references or general guidelines (as discussed in Section 1.2 below), we embarked on an extensive investigation starting with the fundamental case of Retarded Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs), largely influenced by recent papers [29, 30, 31] focusing on the numerical resolution of Boundary Value Problems (BVPs).\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first thorough and detailed examination of error and convergence in piecewise collocation methods for computing periodic solutions of general RFDEs. The proposed approach involves collocating the solution derivative following [31], with the intention of extending it to REs, as elaborated in Section 2.2.\n\nIn this introduction, we begin by establishing two equivalent BVP formulations for general RFDEs in Section 1.1 to facilitate the computation of periodic solutions. Section 1.2 provides an overview of the pertinent literature, while Section 1.3 summarizes the aims, contributions, and results of our proposed analysis. Additionally, Section 1.4 introduces and discusses relevant function spaces and notations.\n\nThe subsequent sections of the paper are divided into three main parts: Section 2 focuses on validating the necessary theoretical assumptions, Section 3 delves into the discretization process and validates the required numerical assumptions, and Section 4 pertains to the final convergence analysis. Concluding remarks are offered in Section 5, and Appendix A compiles the results used in the proofs outlined in the aforementioned main sections.\n\nLet us consider the RFDE y\u2032(t) = G(yt), where G: Y \u2192 Rd is a function defined on a state space Y \u2286 F([-\u03c4, 0], Rd) for a given maximum delay \u03c4 > 0.",
        "Video prediction in computer vision involves estimating future frames at the pixel level based on previous frames. This capability is crucial for intelligent decision-making systems, making video prediction an area of growing interest in both industry and research. Its potential applications are vast, including weather forecasting, traffic situation prediction, and autonomous driving. However, predicting video at the pixel level remains challenging due to the complexities of capturing high-dimensionality and long-term motion dynamics.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, several studies have proposed using deep neural networks (DNNs) to better capture the high-dimensionality and long-term dynamics inherent in video data. Some models simplify the problem by constraining motion and disentangling components, yet they often fail to consider long-term frame dynamics, resulting in blurry frames or incorrect motion trajectories. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been developed to address these issues by focusing on long-term dependencies. RNNs utilize memory cell states to remember past inputs, adjusting according to the current input sequence. Despite this, RNNs struggle with sequences of limited dynamics, such as short-term motion, because their memory cells primarily focus on immediate input relations. For instance, predicting future leg movements in a short walking sequence can be challenging for RNNs, as the long-term motion context is not adequately captured.\n\nOur work seeks to address these long-term motion context issues, which previous video prediction efforts have not fully resolved. To predict future frames accurately, it is essential to determine the long-term motion context that the input belongs to, such as distinguishing between walking and running. The challenges include (i) predicting long-term motion context in sequences with limited dynamics and (ii) handling the high-dimensionality of video data.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel motion context-aware video prediction approach to address these challenges. To tackle the first issue, we introduce long-term motion context memory (LMC-Memory) with memory alignment learning. Unlike RNNs' internal memory cells, LMC-Memory is external and consists of its own parameters, designed to preserve various long-term motion contexts from training data beyond the current input. Memory alignment learning involves two phases: storing long-term motion context from extensive sequences and matching short-term sequences with stored contexts. This allows for the recall of long-term motion dynamics from short-term sequences.\n\nTo address the second challenge, we propose decomposing a memory query used for storing and recalling motion contexts. Given the high-dimensionality of video sequences, capturing the exact motion context matching the input can be difficult. The proposed memory query decomposition allows for storing local contexts and recalling the suitable local context for each input part, enhancing the alignment between input and stored long-term motion context in LMC-Memory.\n\nThe major contributions of this paper are as follows:\n- We introduce a novel motion context-aware video prediction method that addresses the limitations of RNN-based methods in capturing long-term motion contexts.",
        "Since the 1980s, research has demonstrated the feasibility of substantially reducing parameters in neural networks without significantly compromising performance [16, 31].  Pruned neural networks, using specific methods [8, 14], can significantly decrease the computational demands of inference. Among various pruning methods, Network Pruning at Initialization (PaI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential to train sparse networks at lower costs [38].  Specifically, PaI aims to achieve accuracy comparable to a dense network by training a sparse subnetwork initialized from a randomly initialized dense network.\n\nWithin PaI research, the pruning criterion is a key focus [11, 21, 26, 28, 29, 35, 38]. Most PaI methods employ iterative pruning processes to improve performance, but this drastically increases training costs.  In contrast, One-shot Network Pruning at Initialization (OPaI), a branch of PaI, aims to reduce costs through single-step pruning.  Two representative OPaI methods, SNIP [22] and GraSP [37], utilize gradient information from the initial network to identify subnetworks. While both algorithms employ random mini-batches during pruning, the role of the data itself remains unclear.  Furthermore, despite limited experimental evidence, a growing assumption exists that data is not essential in OPaI [12, 19, 32], potentially impacting future OPaI and even broader PaI research.\n\nThis work challenges the presumption of data independence in OPaI. To investigate this, we introduce Discriminative One-shot Network Pruning (DOP), illustrated in Figure 1.  Unlike previous studies, we utilize discriminative data rather than random mini-batches. This approach retains more precise gradient information, preserving crucial network structures and parameters. To identify critical data within a trained classifier for targeted pruning, we generate discriminative image patches using Automatic Concept-based Explanation (ACE) [15].  The ACE algorithm automatically extracts visual concepts crucial for predicting a specific class.",
        "Logical reasoning has long been a crucial and persistent challenge in artificial intelligence (Russell and Norvig, 2010). A logical reasoning system is capable of deriving new facts by applying known rules to known facts and determining the truth value of a given hypothesis; see Figure 1 for an example. Traditionally, building reasoning systems has been heavily reliant on formal logic. However, with the advent of pretrained large language models (LMs), efforts have shifted towards leveraging these models to handle natural language statements for multi-step logical reasoning; see section 5 for a summary.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce LEAP, the first LM-based logical reasoning system that incorporates explicit planning during inference. Our system actively searches through known facts, identifying those that are relevant, and performs multiple rounds of deduction to ascertain the truth value of a statement. During each round, the planning process anticipates future outcomes of possible reasoning decisions\u2014selecting relevant facts and determining what deductions to make\u2014to maximize the likelihood of discovering a valid proof for the statement in question.\n\nPlanning is a fundamental aspect of intelligent behavior, characterized by the ability to use foresight to inform decision-making processes and achieve desirable outcomes. This concept has been instrumental in various artificial intelligence methodologies. For instance, minimax-style game playing anticipates potential replies and counter-replies between players (assuming optimal play) (Russell and Norvig, 2010). Similarly, model-based reinforcement learning leverages environment models to simulate action responses and uses these simulated experiences to learn value functions (e.g., Dyna, Monte-Carlo tree search) (Sutton and Barto, 2018). In natural language processing, planning has been employed to enable language models to generate utterances meeting complex constraints (Lu et al., 2022a).\n\nThe inclusion of planning is particularly significant for logical reasoning. By evaluating future outcomes of decisions, a planning-based system can concentrate on genuinely useful (both given and deduced) facts at an early stage, increasing its chances of success. Moreover, a planning-based reasoning system is generally more interpretable, making it more applicable in user-centric and safety-critical scenarios. Planning provides clarity by showing \"what will happen after\u2014and that is why\u2014I select these known facts and deduce this particular new fact from them,\" which is more informative than merely stating \"I select these and deduce this.\" Notably, none of the previous LM-based systems have utilized explicit planning during inference.\n\nDespite its advantages, planning in logical reasoning presents challenges. A verification mechanism is needed to assess the quality of each potential proof.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Understanding Human Production Variability in Vision-Language Models\n\n## Introduction\n\nRecent years have witnessed increasing popularity in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) given their notable performance in following instructions, answering questions, and in many reasoning tasks, serving as general-purpose assistants (Huang and Chang, 2023; Zhao et al., 2023). In parallel, a new generation of powerful Vision and Language LLMs (VLLMs) with excellent visual understanding and generation capabilities have emerged (Gan et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a). Rapidly, these models have outperformed previous approaches in many downstream tasks.\n\n## Background: Human Production Variability\n\nPrevious work highlighted that speakers display a wide range of variability when asked to utter sentences, resulting in inter-speaker variability but also variability over time for the same speaker (Levelt, 1993; Fan et al., 2018; Alva-Manchego et al., 2021; Takmaz et al., 2024). In particular, in object naming, speakers may refer to objects appearing in a visual scene in many different ways (Graf et al., 2016).\n\nObjects generally belong to multiple categories/super-categories, and all the lexicalized labels of such categories are valid (Brown, 1958). However, although multiple labels are valid, humans pragmatically adapt their naming preferences depending on the context (Olson, 1970; Rohde et al., 2012), resulting in some labels being more frequently uttered than others. For instance, 'mammal' is a correct label to describe a Gold Retriever, but pragmatically less likely than 'dog'. Similarly, speakers tend to prefer sub-ordinate words like 'car' instead of the potentially ambiguous super-ordinate word 'vehicle' in case multiple vehicles appear in the image.\n\n## Research Focus\n\nIn our work, we focus on the Natural Language Generation skills of powerful VLLMs by analyzing an important but under-explored problem, namely, their ability to capture human production variability (in terms of distribution over plausible labels/descriptions) in naming tasks. We are interested in capturing both these two features: while many labels are equally valid and acceptable when naming or describing entities, these labels distribute according to a certain likelihood distribution.\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe investigate this issue in three different production conditions:\n\n1.",
        "## Minimal Problems in Three-View Geometry Under Partial Visibility\n\nThis paper presents a complete classification of minimal problems for generic arrangements of points and lines in 3D space, observed partially by three calibrated perspective cameras. We focus on the case where each line is incident to at most one point (PL\u2081P).  This restriction simplifies the problem while remaining relevant to practical applications using features like SIFT [36] and LAF [37], which can be interpreted as points with attached lines [38].\n\nMinimal problems, essential for tasks like 3D reconstruction [24, 25, 26], image matching [27], and visual odometry [28, 29, 30, 31], involve recovering camera poses and world coordinates from images.  These problems are characterized by a finite positive number of solutions for random input instances.  While a complete characterization of minimal problems under full visibility exists [32], partial visibility, where occlusions and missed detections occur, presents a significantly more complex challenge.\n\nWe address this challenge for the three-view case with the PL\u2081P restriction. This allows us to manage the enumeration complexity while still encompassing practical scenarios.\n\n**Definition 1.** A point-line problem is defined by the tuple (p, l, I, O), representing p points and l lines with incidence relation I \u2282 {1, . . . , p} \u00d7 {1, . . . , l}, and visibility in m views described by O = ((P\u2081, L\u2081), . . . , (Pm, Lm)).  (i, j) \u2208 I indicates the i-th point lies on the j-th line. P\u1d65 and L\u1d65 specify the points and lines visible in view v.  We assume I is realizable in \u211d\u00b3 and complete (containing all implied incidences).  O is such that if a camera observes two intersecting lines according to I, it also observes their intersection point.\n\nAn instance of a point-line problem comprises a spatial point-line arrangement, a list of calibrated camera matrices (P\u2081, \u2026, Pm), and the joint image projections. We aim to recover the arrangement and cameras from the given joint image.  The camera positions are assumed generic, ensuring points and lines are in general position regarding the incidences I.  We fix the coordinate system by setting P\u2081 = [I | 0] and the first coordinate of t\u2082 to 1 [52].\n\n**Definition 2.** A point-line problem is *minimal* if a generic image tuple has a non-zero, finite number of solutions.  This number, constant for generic images, is the problem's *degree*.\n\nOften, only camera poses are of interest.  A problem is *camera-minimal* if it has a finite, non-zero number of camera pose solutions for a generic image tuple. Minimal problems are camera-minimal, but not conversely (e.g., [35]). We further define *terminal camera-minimal* problems as the simplest camera-minimal problems obtained by removing superfluous features without losing camera-minimality.\n\n**Contribution.** We provide a complete classification of minimal PL\u2081P problems in three views. While infinitely many such problems exist, we reduce them to 140,616 equivalence classes of *reduced minimal problems* by removing superfluous features and relabeling cameras. Each class is described by its 3D incidence structure and feature visibility.  All problems within a class share the same algebraic degree.\n\nFurthermore, we identify 74,575 terminal camera-minimal problems, significantly expanding upon the 76 previously known cases [32, 35].  We list all terminal camera-minimal problems with fewer than 300 solutions and highlight other potentially practically relevant cases.\n\nTo achieve this, we define *reduced PL\u2081Ps* as canonical representatives of the minimal PL\u2081P classes.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, with improved readability, coherence, and flow:\n\nResearch in control theory often focuses on stability without considering a system's transient behavior. However, this aspect is crucial in industry: systems with large transient errors or extended settling times are impractical and typically rejected by engineers. PID control has achieved widespread industrial success not only for its simplicity but also because its design addresses key performance specifications like rise-time, settling-time, overshoot, and steady-state error [37]. Nevertheless, PID's inability to explicitly account for constraints and performance requirements often forces engineers to rely on experience and trial-and-error approaches.\n\nThe challenge of designing control systems capable of shaping transient performance has attracted significant research attention. Typical adaptive control schemes struggle with unacceptable transients, and it was in this field that one of the first papers addressing explicit performance specifications in shaping system response emerged [32]. This pioneering work focused on single-input single-output (SISO) minimum phase systems, approaching the problem through dynamic adjustment of controller feedback gains. While other adaptive control studies have addressed transient performance, their results typically present guaranteed bounds on state, output, or control signal evolution [38, 33], rather than deriving control laws that satisfy explicit performance requirements.\n\nFunnel control, introduced in [23], takes an innovative approach by specifying time-varying constraints (the \"funnel\") on the output and adjusting control magnitude based on the output's proximity to the funnel boundary. This theory applies to diverse dynamical systems with known relative degree that satisfy a \"high frequency gain condition\" and have matching input-output counts. Later developments incorporated constrained inputs [20, 19] and bang-bang implementation [30]. Funnel control has found applications across numerous fields [34, 16, 17], with additional insights available in [18, 21, 22].\n\nAlternative approaches to shaping transients include those presented in [1] and [2] for feedback linearizable nonlinear systems and strict-feedback systems, respectively. These methods specify performance requirements through time-varying state constraints and employ transformations to recast the problem into an unconstrained form. While applicable to unknown nonlinear systems under mild assumptions, these approaches still require solving a new stabilization problem. A more recent paper [3] introduces a simplified version of this concept for pure feedback systems.\n\nTarget-tube approaches, introduced in [4] and [13], represent another significant development. These methods specify a time-varying set (the target-tube) over a finite horizon and seek control laws that maintain the state within this tube. For discrete-time linear systems with additive disturbance, [4] demonstrated that linear time-varying feedback could be constructed backwards in time when target-tube and control constraints are ellipsoidal. They also addressed polyhedral target tubes for systems with invertible system matrices.\n\n[Continued text follows similar improvements in clarity and flow while maintaining technical accuracy and references]\n\nThis polished version maintains all technical content while improving readability through:\n- Clearer paragraph transitions\n- More precise language\n- Better sentence structure\n- Improved flow between concepts\n- Consistent technical terminology",
        "Energy communities are increasingly recognized as a solution for enhancing system efficiency, achieving economies of scale, and promoting equity. They facilitate the aggregation of distributed energy resources (DER) and broaden technology access [1]-[3]. An illustrative example of a generic energy community is shown in Fig. 1.

This community engages in energy and monetary transactions with a utility company as a single entity, operating behind a point of common coupling (PCC) downstream of the utility revenue meter [3]. \n\nUnder the widely adopted Net Energy Metering (NEM) policy, the utility revenue meter assesses the community's net consumption. It assigns a buy (retail) rate if the community is a net importer of energy, and a sell (export) rate if the community is a net exporter [4]. Several utilities have implemented programs to enable energy communities, such as NEM aggregation (NEMA) for university campuses, residential complexes, and medical cities.\n\nIn this work, we focus on the pricing mechanism that determines the payment for each community member, based on their consumption, individually owned renewable energy, and their share of the community-owned DER.",
        "Topic models have been a fundamental and prevalent research area for decades, aiming to discover latent topics from a document collection and infer the topic distributions of documents (Churchill and Singh, 2022). Various topic modeling scenarios have been explored, such as hierarchical, dynamic, and cross-lingual topic modeling (Griffiths et al., 2003; Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Mimno et al., 2009). Current topic models can be categorized into two types: conventional topic models employing probabilistic graphical models (Blei et al., 2003) or non-negative matrix factorization (Lee and Seung, 2000), and recently popular neural topic models (Zhao et al., 2021a). Due to their effectiveness and interpretability, topic models have inspired various downstream tasks and applications (Boyd-Graber et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2023c). However, despite these significant achievements, quick utilization and fair comparisons of various topic models remain a formidable challenge. The challenge lies in their unsystematic model implementations as well as inconsistent dataset and evaluation settings across papers, even within a paper (Hoyle et al., 2021).\n\nIn response to this challenge, several topic modeling toolkits have been proposed, but they commonly exhibit incompleteness. Early toolkits (McCallum, 2002; Qiang et al., 2020; Lisena et al., 2020) often lack necessary steps in the modeling lifecycle (e.g., pre-processing and comprehensive evaluations), critical topic modeling scenarios, or recent neural topic models. The latest toolkit is OCTIS (Terragni et al., 2021), which integrates more features, but it solely focuses on basic and hierarchical topic modeling and lacks the latest neural topic models (It only includes two neural topic models after 2018). These issues pose hurdles to the evaluations, comparisons, applications, and developments of topic models.\n\nTo address these issues, in this paper, we propose TopMost, a Topic Modeling System Toolkit. In contrast to existing toolkits, TopMost comprehensively includes the most popular topic modeling scenarios: basic, hierarchical, dynamic, and cross-lingual topic modeling. It covers the entire lifecycle of these scenarios with datasets, pre-processing, model training, testing, and evaluations.",
        "Neural network architectures are widely used in information retrieval, employing various strategies to represent and compare user queries with potential documents. This work focuses on enhancing document representation to improve retrieval quality and robustness.\n\nOne common approach is the Bi-encoder (Karpukhin et al., 2020), utilizing two transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) \u2013 which can be shared or separate \u2013 to encode queries and documents into vector representations. Similarity, often calculated using dot product or cosine similarity, is then computed between these vectors to determine relevance.\n\nContrastingly, Cross-encoders (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) combine query and document inputs early on, creating a joint embedding vector for relevance prediction. This deeper interaction often leads to superior performance compared to bi-encoders when nuanced understanding is crucial.\n\nBridging these two approaches are late-interaction models like ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020), ColBERTv2 (Santhanam et al., 2021), and SPALDE++ (Formal et al., 2022).  These models independently encode queries and documents into token-level vectors, resembling a \"bag of embeddings\" approach.  The \"late interaction\" occurs when cosine similarity or dot product scores are calculated across these token-level vectors.\n\nAll these architectures rely on informative embeddings of both queries and documents.  While query content is beyond our control during retrieval, we can enrich document embeddings, which is the core hypothesis driving this work.\n\nTo this end, we propose LLM-augmented retrieval, a model-agnostic framework designed to enhance document embeddings with richer contextual information.  A key component is the introduction of *doc-level embedding*, which further integrates contextual information.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n\n1. The LLM-augmented retrieval framework, improving the quality and robustness of existing retrieval models.\n2. The doc-level embedding approach for richer contextual representation.\n3. Comprehensive evaluation across various models and datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance exceeding original models.\n4. Enhancements to key retrieval model training components, including negative sampling and loss functions.",
        "The world is witnessing a paradigm shift in the way we conduct daily activities amidst the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This shift affects various aspects of life, such as online learning, socializing, interaction, conducting business, and shopping. These global catastrophes have a profound impact on our social life, but not all cultures react and respond in the same way during a crisis. Even under normal circumstances, research suggests that people across different cultures reason differently [1]. For instance, in his book, \"The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently... and Why,\" Nisbett states that East Asians think dialectically and holistically, while Westerners think logically, abstractly, and analytically [2]. Cultural behavior and attitudes are influenced by factors including the socio-economic situation, faith, belief systems, and lifestyle.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis, in particular, highlighted greater cultural differences, even among countries that share similarities in language, history, and culture. For example, although Denmark and Sweden, two neighboring countries, speak almost the same language, and share a lot, they reacted very differently to the coronavirus [3].",
        "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a relatively common, life-threatening condition, affecting 25 out of every 100,000 people annually. It can develop following physical trauma or spontaneously, without any external cause. The seriousness of ICH is highlighted by a high 30-day mortality rate, reaching up to 52%, and a significant risk of lasting consequences for survivors. For these reasons, the swift detection of ICH is crucial, enabling the early initiation of treatment. Delays in diagnosis, even by a few minutes, can increase the risk of permanent brain dysfunction or even result in fatality. Modern computer systems that analyze brain CT scans can provide rapid, effective support for computer-aided diagnosis, proving invaluable for physicians, particularly in acute cases.\n\nCurrently, most advanced methods focus on deep learning, particularly using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and their various adaptations or combinations. Published detection algorithms, such as those in references [2] and [3], utilize 3D CNN-based classification at the patient level, offering a decision on the presence of ICH in patient scans. The authors of [4] designed a system that combines a 2D CNN with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm for ICH detection in CT slices. Another approach, blending CNN and recurrent neural networks, was introduced in [5], which includes classification of ICH sub-types.\n\nFor 2D ICH segmentation, including type classification, the authors of [6] applied a cascade CNN model. Similarly, the authors of [7] proposed a hybrid 2D/3D approach, utilizing the Mask Regional-CNN algorithm, for the same task.",
        "Autonomous driving has long been a highly anticipated technology since the emergence of modern artificial intelligence. Despite decades of research, the widespread deployment of self-driving cars remains elusive. The main obstacle to achieving this goal lies in the difficulty of generalization. The world and its drivers present a level of diversity that exceeds the capabilities of current planning methods. Classical hand-designed planning struggles to adapt to new or unfamiliar situations, while learning-based approaches offer more promise but still face challenges when dealing with a wide range of driving scenarios.\n\nMany existing solutions focus on either generating safety-critical scenarios in simulations or collecting extensive real-world driving data. However, our approach takes a different route by exploring an alternative direction. We propose a mapless, learning-based end-to-end driving system called LAV. LAV leverages multi-modal sensor inputs and learns from the behaviors of all nearby vehicles in the scene for both perception and planning. This system predicts future trajectories for all detected vehicles, including the ego-vehicle, during testing, enhancing safety and decision-making.\n\nIn the realm of autonomous driving, encountering accidents is relatively rare for most individuals, but observing such events is common. Leveraging this insight, LAV adopts a strategy that involves learning from the trajectories of all vehicles present in the environment. By training on the experiences of other vehicles, the model gains valuable insights into potential safety-critical situations and improves its ability to handle complex driving scenarios effectively.\n\nAddressing the challenge posed by the partial observability of other vehicles, LAV employs a unified approach that integrates perception and motion processing. Through privileged distillation, LAV develops a perception model that generates viewpoint-invariant representations, enabling robust sensor handling. Simultaneously, a motion planner is trained to predict trajectories based on future waypoints, utilizing ground-truth computer-vision labels to ensure accurate high-level command inference. By combining these components, LAV establishes a comprehensive framework for jointly recognizing, predicting, and planning driving actions.\n\nOur method, implemented and evaluated in the CARLA driving simulator, has demonstrated outstanding performance, ranking at the top of the CARLA public leaderboard and winning the 2021 CARLA Autonomous Driving challenge. With a significantly improved driving score and route completion rate compared to existing approaches, LAV showcases the potential of our novel learning-based system in advancing autonomous driving technology.",
        "Motion planning for purely continuous-time systems and purely discrete-time systems has been well studied in the literature. In recent years, several feasible motion planning algorithms have been developed, including graph search algorithms, artificial potential field methods, and sampling-based algorithms. Of these, sampling-based algorithms like the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithms have gained attention due to their fast exploration speed for high-dimensional problems and theoretical guarantees.\n\nA feasible solution is often not sufficient in many applications, as the quality of the solution is crucial. While the RRT algorithm is known to converge to a sub-optimal solution, variants such as PRM* and RRT* have been developed for optimal motion planning problems with guaranteed asymptotic optimality. However, these variants require a steering function, limiting their applicability. The stable sparse RRT (SST) algorithm, on the other hand, does not require a steering function and is guaranteed to be asymptotically near optimal.\n\nWhile motion planning algorithms have been extensively applied to purely continuous-time and purely discrete-time systems, less attention has been given to motion planning for hybrid systems. In this context, a hybrid RRT algorithm was previously developed to address feasible motion planning problems for such systems. This paper introduces a motion planning algorithm for hybrid systems that aims to ensure the optimality of the solution by formulating an optimal motion planning problem inspired by previous work.\n\nThe proposed algorithm, named HySST, incrementally constructs a search tree rooted in the initial state set towards random samples. By drawing samples, selecting vertices with minimal cost, and propagating state trajectories, HySST navigates the state space efficiently. It also maintains a set of witnesses to represent explored regions and employs a pruning process to optimize the search. Under mild assumptions, HySST is shown to be asymptotically near-optimal, making it the first optimal RRT-type algorithm for systems with hybrid dynamics.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section II introduces notation and preliminaries, Section III presents the problem statement and applications, Section IV details the HySST algorithm, Section V analyzes its asymptotic near optimality, and Section VI illustrates its application in examples. Further details and proofs can be found in the accompanying material.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving readability and flow:\n\nTransformer-based encoder-decoder models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), achieving remarkable success across various tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020), particularly in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sennrich et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017). However, their autoregressive decoding process poses significant computational challenges, especially as models grow in complexity with additional layers and parameters. This presents substantial obstacles when deploying Transformer-based models in real-time applications (Gu et al., 2017) and online services (Zhou et al., 2022).\n\nKnowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution by reducing model size (Hinton et al., 2015). Through KD, knowledge transfers from a high-performing, large-parameter teacher model to a more compact student model. This process yields a distilled model that is both lightweight and efficient, ensuring faster inference times and reduced computational requirements. Moreover, under the teacher model's guidance, the student model can often achieve performance levels approaching those of the teacher\u2014surpassing what it might achieve through independent training.\n\nKD, pioneered by Bucila et al., Ba and Caruana, and Hinton et al., traditionally transfers knowledge using responses from the network's final layer. Various approaches have emerged, including Sequence-level KD (Kim and Rush, 2016) and Selective KD (Wang et al., 2021), which utilize the final output and soft labels from teacher responses, respectively. These methods fall under response-based KD (Gou et al., 2021). Beyond final layer outputs, feature-based KD leverages intermediate features from the teacher model's layers for more comprehensive knowledge transfer (Romero et al., 2015; Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2017; Sun et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020).\n\nMost feature-based KD research in Transformers has focused on compressing encoder-based models (Sanh et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Passban et al., 2021), including pre-trained models like BERT. While some studies (Wu et al., 2020; Shleifer and Rush, 2020) have applied feature-based KD to decoder tasks, they found it less effective than response-based KD for decoder distillation (Kim and Rush, 2016; Kasai et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021).\n\nA fundamental question emerges when extending KD across layers: \"Which teacher layers should inform each student layer's learning?\" Rather than addressing this through trainable methods, several studies (Sun et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Passban et al., 2021) have employed heuristic approaches, using predetermined skip connections or layer combinations. However, as model depth increases, the complexity of selecting optimal feature combinations grows exponentially. For instance, Combinatorial KD (Wu et al., 2020) demonstrated that peak performance depends on language-pair-specific feature mapping.\n\nThis paper introduces Align-to-Distill (A2D), a novel KD strategy that addresses the feature mapping challenge through a trainable Attention Alignment Module (AAM). Unlike previous methods relying on heuristic feature mapping, A2D provides an end-to-end trainable solution. Its adaptive feature alignment eliminates the need for data-dependent mapping strategies. Furthermore, AAM aligns student attention maps with teacher attention maps at the head level, enabling more effective distillation than layer-wise feature mapping. Through pointwise convolution with minimal additional parameters, AAM allows each student attention head to learn from every teacher head across different layers, removing the requirement for head or layer parity between models.\n\nOur experimental results demonstrate that A2D's fine-grained, head-wise attention transfer effectively applies to Transformer decoders\u2014an area where previous feature-based KD approaches have struggled. By compressing the decoder with A2D, we reduce autoregressive inference costs while maintaining performance. Comprehensive studies across high-resource and low-resource NMT tasks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both feature-based and response-based KD approaches. Notably, in low-resource settings, A2D-trained student models can match or exceed teacher performance despite their smaller size.\n\nOur key contributions are:\n\u2022 Introduction of \"Align-to-Distill\" (A2D), a novel attention-based distillation method effectively applicable to Transformer decoders\n\u2022 Development of a learnable alignment mechanism between attention heads across different layers, overcoming limitations of previous feature-mapping heuristics\n\u2022 Implementation of fine-grained attention knowledge transfer that outperforms state-of-the-art KD strategies in both high-resource and low-resource translation tasks",
        "In this paper, we explore embeddings of graphs where vertices are mapped to points in \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\), for \\( d \\geq 3 \\), and edges are represented by line segments on the \\( d \\)-dimensional axis-parallel planes. A 3-dimensional network, for instance, can be visualized inside a cube, with edges drawn on the walls of the cube through the projection of points.\n\nOne motivation for studying these embeddings is their connection to two classical graph parameters: thickness and geometric thickness. The thickness of a graph \\( G \\) is defined as the smallest number of planar subgraphs into which the edges of \\( G \\) can be decomposed. This concept was introduced by Tutte [18], and further explored in a survey on thickness [16]. Geometric thickness introduces an additional constraint that requires all subgraphs to be embedded simultaneously, with a common vertex embedding. This was investigated for complete graphs in [4]. The relationship between geometric thickness and other parameters such as maximum degree and tree-width has been studied in several papers, including [8], [2], and [7]. While using standard coordinate planes in high dimensions is more restrictive than thickness, it appears to be less so than geometric thickness (discussed further in Section 3).\n\nBook embeddings, as defined by Ollmann [17], are a restriction of geometric drawings where vertices are positioned in a convex manner. The book thickness, or stack number, of a graph \\( G \\), is the minimum number of subgraphs needed to cover all the edges of \\( G \\) in such a drawing. This concept is explored in [6], with a comprehensive survey available in [5].\n\nA broader survey on simultaneous embedding of graphs can be found in [3].",
        "Transformer-based architectures, such as BERT, have recently led to breakthroughs in various language-related tasks, including document classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and various forms of text mining (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019; Adhikari et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020). These models create semantic representations of text, which can be subsequently used in many downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019). The training process for Transformers typically includes two phases: pre-training, where the model learns to extract semantic representations from large, task-independent corpora, followed by task-specific fine-tuning on a separate dataset to further optimize model performance.\n\nIn this paper, we study the effects of fine-tuning Transformer-based architectures in a federated learning (FL) setting, where models are trained in a decentralized fashion on a number of local compute instances, called clients, and intermittently aggregated and synchronized via a central server. Federated learning is a solution for distributed computing and data, providing a level of privacy regarding the sharing of personal or sensitive data. Model aggregation is commonly performed via the averaging of the weights of the individual client models, known as Federated Averaging (FEDAVG) (McMahan et al., 2017a).\n\nThe number of clients in a federated learning setting can vary, depending on the application. For example, in scenarios where smartphones are used as clients, the number can reach into the millions (Hard et al., 2018).",
        "Old Master paintings are frequently examined technically, to analyze artistic materials and techniques, or to support conservation and restoration.  Recent years have witnessed a digital revolution in this field, with widespread adoption of advanced analytical and imaging technologies generating large, multi-dimensional datasets [1] - [3].  Traditional X-radiographs, despite their long history, remain crucial for technical study, conservation, and preservation due to their ability to penetrate a painting's stratigraphy [4], [5].  X-rays reveal a painting's condition (e.g., subsurface losses and damage), the status of paint passages (identifying retouching, fills, or other interventions), and information about the support (canvas type or panel construction).  Crucially, X-ray images also provide insights into the artist's layering process, revealing *pentimenti*\u2014changes made during painting, including concealed earlier designs painted over during revisions or when supports were reused.  Research from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam indicates that nearly 15% (20 of 130) of Van Gogh's paintings contain such concealed images [6].\n\nConsequently, there is significant interest in visualizing these hidden designs to better understand artworks and artistic practice.  Various imaging modalities have been employed to enhance visualization of concealed images [7], improve imaging of underdrawings [8] - [11], or reveal overwritten texts in palimpsests.  Several studies have proposed X-ray image separation approaches [14] - [18]. However, these methods typically apply to double-sided painting panels where, in addition to the mixed X-ray image, researchers have access to RGB images of both the front and back.\n\nThis paper addresses a more challenging scenario, where only the mixed X-ray image (Fig. 1b) and a single RGB image of the visible painting (Fig. 1a) are available.  Extracting concealed images from mixed X-rays is complex because these images are two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional artworks.  A single X-ray captures features from both the concealed and surface designs, as well as the support (e.g., canvas weave or wood grain), making it difficult for experts to distinguish elements of the concealed painting (see Fig. 1).\n\nInspired by our previous work [19], we propose a new deep learning-based approach to separate mixed X-ray images of paintings with concealed designs into their hypothetical constituents: X-ray images of the visible painting and the concealed image. Our entirely self-supervised approach leverages only the mixed X-ray image and the RGB image of the painting.  This method has been applied to real paintings, including Francisco de Goya's portrait of Do\u00f1a Isabel de Porcel (Fig.",
        "Deep neural networks are powerful, but their size and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices like dash cams or in real-time applications such as autonomous driving.  Network compression addresses this challenge by reducing memory and computational costs. Popular techniques include quantization, knowledge distillation, and network pruning. Unlike other compression methods, pruning directly removes network components, typically involving a pre-train, prune, and fine-tune cycle. Pruning methods primarily differ in their granularity and importance measures.\n\nUnstructured pruning removes individual parameters or connections, resulting in unstructured sparsity that necessitates specialized software and hardware for acceleration.  Conversely, structured pruning removes entire channels, filters, or neurons, creating structured sparsity readily exploitable by standard hardware. This leads to both reduced storage and faster inference. This paper focuses on structured channel pruning.\n\nExisting filter/channel pruning approaches often employ different importance measures. While effective, these measures are frequently ad-hoc, locally computed, and not directly tied to the final task's utility.  Furthermore, few studies address visual detection specifically.  This paper proposes a gradient-based saliency measure for visual detection to guide the pruning process. Channels with higher gradient-based detection saliency contribute more significantly to the visual detector's predictions.\n\nOur key contributions are:\n\n* We leverage the gradients of the detection utility with respect to channel features as our saliency measure for pruning deep visual detectors in autonomous driving scenarios, a departure from most existing methods.\n* By incorporating ground truth bounding box information and surrounding context, we reweight the detection task gradients, further enhancing pruning performance and demonstrating significant potential for handling small-scale objects.",
        "In the rapidly evolving field of generative models, aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a paramount challenge, especially for text-to-image (T2I) models. Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in generating text that caters to a wide range of human needs, primarily through a two-stage process of pretraining on noisy web-scale datasets followed by finetuning on a smaller, preference-specific dataset. The fine-tuning process aims to align the generative model's outputs with human preferences, without significantly diminishing the capabilities gained from pretraining. Extending this fine-tuning approach to text-to-image models offers the prospect of tailoring image generation to user preferences, a goal that has remained relatively underexplored compared to its counterpart in the language domain.\n\nRecent works have begun to explore fine-tuning text-to-image models to better align with human preferences. These methods either use a reward model, trained using human preference data, and fine-tune the T2I model to maximize reward, or they directly fine-tune the T2I model on pairwise preference data. However, gathering paired preference data is an expensive and time-consuming process in which human annotators rank pairs of images according to their preferences. It is difficult to collect pairwise preference data at scale, and these datasets may be noisy as preference is subjective and varies from user to user. Additionally, training a robust reward model and fine-tuning text-to-image models using a reward model can introduce significant challenges in training, add high computational overhead in terms of memory, and limit generalization.\n\nIn this work, we explore fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models using per-image binary feedback and without requiring a reward model. Inspired by the large-scale applicability of learning from per-image binary feedback, we explore how to directly fine-tune text-to-image models using per-image preferences. We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models from per-image binary feedback signals, e.g. like or dislike, by extending the human utility maximization framework used in LLMs to the setting of text-to-image diffusion models.",
        "Fog computing, a nascent paradigm, merges the strengths of edge and cloud computing [8, 31].  For low latency, application components are deployed near the edge, close to end-users. This proximity also reduces bandwidth consumption, mitigates privacy risks, and enables continued edge operation during network partitions.  Conversely, for high scalability, components can leverage powerful machines like cloudlets [50] within the core network [8] or reside directly in the cloud. This comprehensive execution environment, often called \"fog\" [8, 9], encompasses all devices along the \"cloud-to-thing continuum\" [36]. Despite its numerous advantages, fog computing has seen limited application development, and commercial deployments remain nascent [57].  The primary hurdle is arguably the deployment and management of physical infrastructure, especially at the edge, contrasting sharply with the ease of cloud adoption [8].\n\nThis infrastructural challenge impacts the entire fog application lifecycle, affecting not only production system operation but also application testing. While initial design questions can be addressed through simulation [e.g., 10, 17, 20], practical testing on physical infrastructure becomes essential.  However, access to this infrastructure is typically fleeting, available only between physical deployment and production launch.  Before this window, the infrastructure may not exist, and afterward, its capacity is dedicated to production. This lack of access hinders complex integration tests and benchmarks, such as those for fault-tolerance in wide-area deployments, leaving developers reliant on conjecture, small local testbeds, and simulations. Existing infrastructure emulation approaches often focus solely on emulating edge devices [e.g., 22, 44].  Others emulate core network or cloud infrastructure but lack automated experiment orchestration [e.g., 12, 32].\n\nThis paper extends our preliminary work [21] by proposing the evaluation of fog applications on a cloud-based emulated infrastructure testbed, manipulated by a pre-defined orchestration schedule.  In this emulated fog environment, virtual cloud machines are configured to closely mirror the real (or planned) fog infrastructure. Using network characteristic data from the production environment or based on expectations and experience, interconnections between emulated fog machines are manipulated to exhibit similar behavior.  Similarly, performance measurements from real fog machines inform resource limits on Dockerized application containers. This allows for full cloud deployment of fog applications while replicating the performance and failure characteristics of a real deployment.",
        "Smart infrastructure projects, such as building automation, are increasingly reliant on Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Building Management Systems (BMS) for metadata and data collection, analysis, and activation components. BMS systems often have the capability to monitor lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), and electricity consumption. Typically utilizing proprietary software, most BMS vendors offer closed system products with industrial interfaces for activation, control, and basic data visualization, lacking the additional contextual data from BIM. At the same time, significant effort is being dedicated to the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to enhance sensor density, yet the industry remains highly fragmented.\n\nFurthermore, legacy BMS systems and much of the current research focus on in-building sensor data collection, storage, and presentation platforms, often overlooking the challenges and advantages of real-time data analysis and response capabilities. BMS systems historically manage low-volume, low-velocity data and metadata, so the integration of IoT devices presents considerable network and system challenges in handling real-time data analysis, event recognition, prediction, and action planning.\n\nThis paper centers on the real-time aspects of spatio-temporal data accessible from IoT sensing. We define a real-time platform as an asynchronous system capable of processing high-volume, heterogeneous data with minimal latency to gather, analyze, predict, and adapt to changes promptly.\n\nWhile a real-time data architecture is a crucial component, the industry still lacks standardized methods to integrate BIM and deployed sensors into a unified system. Although efforts have been made through initiatives like creating ontologies (e.g., BRICK) to unify static metadata for use by building automation systems, industry acceptance of metadata standards remains limited. Moreover, adapting building and facility management software to accommodate the augmentation of BIM with IoT devices is essential. Highly compartmentalized BMS software must evolve to manage an increased amount of contextual building data promptly to align with the utilization of edge computing for accident and emergency management and smart home initiatives, resulting in the establishment of safer and more resilient smart spaces. Novel approaches integrating BIM, BMS, and sensor data are therefore imperative.\n\nTo address these critical challenges, we introduce the Adaptive City Platform (ACP), a system for real-time collection, processing, and visualization of building information and sensor data.",
        "The data collection process for a given phenomenon can be influenced by various sources of variability, creating distinct domains. For instance, natural images with differing illumination, contrast, or noise may impact the classification performance of a machine learning model previously trained in another domain. Similarly, in biology, the study of single-cell dynamics is conducted using diverse instruments, conditions, and modalities, presenting unique challenges and opportunities. In many cases, the relationships between different domains are unknown. Thus, the fusion and integration of multi-domain data have been extensively studied in the data science community for supervised learning, data mining, and exploratory data analysis. One of the earliest methods for achieving this is Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which identifies a linear projection to maximize the correlation between two domains. Over the years, CCA has been extended to different formulations such as sparse CCA and Kernel CCA.\n\nIn many applications, a reasonable assumption is that two different datasets, measured from the same underlying phenomenon, are captured under various conditions, instruments, and experimental designs. Manifold alignment assumes a shared latent space from which observations are mapped by functions f and g to different ambient spaces. We aim to uncover the underlying relationship between observations residing in different spaces, X and Y, without assuming any known pairings. Instead, we assume there are labeled observations for different classes. The assumption is that data collected in different domains are governed by a set of shared underlying modes of variation or latent variables. The manifold assumption often applies, suggesting that data in different domains lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces, resulting from smooth mappings of latent variables. With this in mind, manifold alignment (MA) has become a common technique for data integration. Applications of MA include handling different face poses, protein structure alignment, medical images for Alzheimer's disease classification, multimodal sensing images, graph-matching, and integrating single-cell multi-omics data.\n\nVarious MA methods have been proposed based on different prior knowledge assumptions that relate the two domains. Methods such as CCA or multi-view diffusion maps can be categorized as supervised MA, as they assume paired data. More challenging scenarios arise when little or no a priori pairing knowledge is available. Purely unsupervised algorithms are designed for scenarios where there are no pairings or other side information. These algorithms rely solely on the topology of each domain to infer inter-domain similarities.\n\nMethods that utilize additional information are often categorized as semi-supervised MA. Some methods consider partial correspondence information, where a few one-to-one matching samples act as anchor points for aligning the rest of the data. Some approaches leverage the graph structure of the data, closely related to Laplacian eigenmaps, while others use neural networks, such as the GAN-based MAGAN or autoencoders.\n\nHowever, acquiring even partial correspondences can be costly or impossible, as in biological applications where the measurement process destroys cells, making it impossible to measure other modalities of the same cells. Even without known correspondences between domains, unsupervised MA is not the only option. If we have access to side information like discrete class labels, we can use this extra knowledge for manifold alignment. Motivated by this, we propose a new semi-supervised MA algorithm called MALI (Manifold Alignment with Label Information). MALI leverages the manifold structure of data in both domains, combined with discrete label information, and does not require known corresponding points between domains. Built on the manifold learning method Diffusion Maps and optimal transport, MALI outperforms current state-of-the-art MA algorithms in this setting across multiple datasets by several metrics.\n\nThe setting described above is similar to the domain adaptation (DA) problem. In traditional machine learning, the training set and test set are assumed to be sampled from the same distribution and share the same features. However, these assumptions often do not hold, due to various collection circumstances. When data is expensive or time-consuming to label, it may be desirable to train a model on existing related datasets and adapt it to a new task. The goal is to leverage the knowledge acquired from training on one dataset to enhance performance on the same task with a different dataset, or potentially even a different task. One approach to tackle DA is to use MA, as knowledge can be transferred through MA via the learned inter-domain correspondences or by training on a shared latent representation of both domains.",

To mitigate this challenge, a viable solution lies in the utilization of synthetic data, which offers meticulously annotated samples at a low cost for training pose estimation models. However, the substantial disparities between synthetic (source) and real (target) models result in suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, a promising approach emerges, combining domain randomization and photo-realistic synthetic data, aiming to address the domain shift between the source and target domains.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, we discretize the captured 3D object, acquired using a high-resolution camera, into descriptive components, comprising texture, material, shape, and inertial dynamics. This process is facilitated by a customized neural network known as Disc-Net, which accepts RGBD data and CAD models of the object of interest as inputs, enabling the extraction of desired object features. The proposed Disc-Net architecture incorporates two distinct neural network components: style extraction, encompassing texture and material, while the other focuses on shape and inertial parameters.\n\nIn our study, we adopt the real-sim-real transfer method as a means of domain adaptation to overcome sensor noise and realism issues. The resulting synthetic annotated dataset is then utilized for training various pose estimation networks, including PoseCNN, PVNet, and DOPE, and assessing their performance within real-world settings, thereby providing a benchmark for evaluating the realism and effectiveness of the generated dataset for sim2real transfer.",
        "Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs) are extensively utilized to describe the evolution of underlying diffusion processes over time. These PDEs are applied in various fields, including modeling dynamics in physics and chemistry (e.g., [56, 78, 99]), analyzing population growth in biology (e.g., [59, 62]), modeling the evolution of stock prices in finance and economics (e.g., [2, 12, 100]), and climate modeling (e.g., [42, 98]), among others.\n\nConsider the following Kolmogorov PDE (see, e.g., [15, 17, 20, 28, 40, 46, 61, 77, 90, 91]):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\partial_t v(t, x) + \\langle b, \\nabla_x v(t, x) \\rangle + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{tr}(\\sigma \\sigma^T D^2_x v(t, x)) = 0 \\text{ on } [0, T) \\times \\mathbb{R}^d; \\\\\n& v(T, x) = f(x) \\text{ on } \\mathbb{R}^d.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n(1.1)\n\nA common challenge across all fields is determining the true drift and volatility parameters \\( (b, \\sigma) \\) to describe the underlying evolution process, which is usually unknown. Typically, these parameters are either estimated using historical data or selected based on expert opinions. However, model misspecification can lead to erroneous outcomes, as was evident during the financial crisis in 2008 when financial derivatives were priced using solutions of equation (1.1) with parameters inconsistent with market behavior.",
        "The rapid rise of online social networks (OSNs) and online social media platforms has changed the way that audiences interact with journalism, news, and each other. This shift has led to a decentralization of news reporting and information dissemination in general. Alongside the many advantages of this decentralization, however, come many disadvantages, key among them being the undermining of the trust model of traditional news, in which news institutions act as \"gatekeepers\" of information. Essentially, the old \"one-to-many\" model of news has been replaced by a new many-to-many mode. Meanwhile, platforms are reluctant to take on the duties of gatekeeping. As recently evidenced by the controversy surrounding Twitter's decision to begin flagging the tweets of United States President Donald Trump for violent, misleading, or false statements, when platforms become gatekeepers, explosive social-political consequences can follow. All told, this has resulted in a situation in which misinformation and its more dangerous cousin, disinformation, can spread swiftly through an online audience.\n\nDue to the proliferation of digital misinformation and disinformation, it has become necessary to study a primary vector of their distribution within digital spaces: fake accounts. Research into fake accounts has primarily focused on detection and, increasingly, control. There have been two historic drivers of this: on the one hand, the influx of fake accounts into digital spaces, which has reached crisis proportions in recent years - for example, in May 2019, Facebook reported that it took down three billion fake accounts, and five percent of its total monthly account activity was constituted by fake accounts - combined with the ease of Twitter data collection.\n\nIn this paper, we take a critical look at the lack of conscious development of taxonomies around the phenomenon of fake accounts and propose a systematic way to think taxonomically about the phenomenon. Specifically, we combine methods from computer science and philosophy to create a comprehensive theory of fake accounts, including definitions of what it means to be \"fake\" and a fake account, and key taxonomical aspects of the latter. Along the way, we deconstruct the narrow binary thinking surrounding fake accounts as specifically exhibited in Facebook's conceptual framework of \"Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior\" and as more generally manifested in a series of false dichotomies about the phenomenon.\n\nTaxonomical Thinking Taxonomies must strike an optimal but difficult balance between mixed, or even opposing, intuitions and methods of analysis about the phenomenon they are intended to typologize or categorize. The most effective taxonomies are those that resist two major temptations: a) binary frameworks and b) over-reliance on either quantitative or qualitative methods of analysis. Along these lines, taxonomical thinking is a meta-level activity that occurs prior to (or simultaneously with) the development of an actual taxonomy. The would-be taxonomist should consciously think through not only the necessary typologies or categories, but the meta-types or meta-categories themselves, viz., the quantifiable and qualitative aspects - the empirical elements and the intuitions - that the types or categories are intended to capture.",
        "Deep neural networks, with their characteristically deep, multi-layered structure, have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing.  A key challenge in leveraging these architectures lies in efficiently transforming and fusing information across these numerous layers.  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) exemplifies this challenge, with self-attention-based systems (Vaswani et al., 2017) now achieving state-of-the-art performance and training speed, surpassing previous recurrent neural network architectures (Wu et al., 2016) like those used in earlier successful NMT systems (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, standard Transformer models typically utilize only the top encoder and decoder layers, neglecting potentially valuable information embedded in other layers.  Previous work (Shi et al., 2016) has shown that different layers of the encoder capture different types of syntactic information, both local and global.  Fusing information from these various layers has proven beneficial in both computer vision (Yu et al., 2018) and natural language processing tasks (Shen et al., 2018; Dou et al., 2018).  This work builds upon these findings, introducing a more efficient approach to cross-layer information fusion.\n\nSpecifically, we propose residual tree aggregation of layers (RTAL), a method inspired by techniques from numerical analysis (Peters et al., 2018; He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017).  RTAL utilizes a post-order binary tree structure with residual connections to combine layer outputs, effectively addressing the limitations of standard NMT models by incorporating information from all layers. The residual connections further enrich the information flow within the tree. We also explore various aggregation formulas to optimize performance.\n\nOur contributions are threefold:\n\n* We introduce RTAL, a novel approach for fusing information across layers, addressing the limitations of standard NMT models that rely solely on the top encoder and decoder layers. The residual connections within RTAL enhance information flow and representation learning.\n* RTAL is efficient, easy to implement, and generalizable to arbitrary multi-layer deep neural networks.\n* This work further strengthens the growing body of research (Dou et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) demonstrating the potential of cross-layer information fusion in natural language processing.",
        "Here is a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow, organized into clear thematic sections:\n\n# Introduction and Motivation\nMany large scale cyber-physical systems, such as electric power grids [1], intelligent transportation systems [2], and industrial infrastructures [3], are equipped with sensor networks, providing in situ and diverse measurements to monitor them. This makes possible the construction of system state estimates, which are essential to guarantee the safe and effective operation of these critical applications. Motivated by this, an intense research activity on the analysis and design of distributed estimation algorithms has ensued. In this way, each sensor, equipped with local communication and processing capabilities, interacts with neighboring nodes to compute joint estimates cooperatively.\n\n# Centralized vs. Distributed Approaches\n## Centralized Observer Methods\nA way to obtain such estimates is to use a centralized observer, by which a super node collects all measurements from the nodes and fuses them in an optimal way. The ubiquitous Kalman filter [4] and related approaches have been used extensively for this purpose. However, these algorithms do not scale well as the size of the network increases and are vulnerable to single-point failures.\n\n## Distributed Estimation Methods\nThis spawned research on the design of distributed estimation filters (for systems subject to known stochastic disturbances) for sensor networks communicating only locally over a possibly timevarying network [5]. While these methods are more scalable and robust to communication failures than their centralized counterparts, they generally have comparatively worse estimation error. An important class of algorithms that aim to approach the estimation performance of their Kalman filter counterparts, are Kalman-consensus filters, which combine a local Kalman-like update with average consensus to align agents' estimates [6], [7].\n\n# Interval Observers for Bounded Disturbances\nWhen stochastic characterization of disturbances is not available, interval observers have emerged as a popular method for obtaining robust, guaranteed estimates of the state, due to their simplicity and computational efficiency [8]-[10]. Various approaches to design centralized interval observers for different classes of dynamical systems have been proposed [11]-[17].\n\n## Challenges in Current Approaches\nThe main design strategy typically involves synthesizing appropriate centralized observer gains to obtain a robustly stable and positive observer error system. However, this approach:\n- Requires solving centralized semi-definite programs with numerous constraints\n- Faces theoretical and computational difficulties for large-scale systems\n- Suffers from poor communication scalability\n\nRecent studies have attempted to address these issues through:\n- Distributed interval observers for block-diagonalizable LTI systems [18]\n- Observers for LTI systems under denial-of-service attacks [19]\n- IPR-based robust distributed interval observers [20]\n\nHowever, these solutions still have limitations regarding performance and convergence time.\n\n# Novel Contributions\nTo overcome these drawbacks, this work contributes to bridging the gap between interval observer design approaches and distributed estimation algorithms for systems with distribution-free uncertainties. Our key contributions include:\n\n1. A novel method for synthesizing scalable distributed interval observers for discrete-time LTI systems with bounded additive disturbances\n2. Necessary and sufficient conditions for observer stability\n3. Introduction of \"collective positive detectability over neighborhoods\" (CPDN)\n4. A tractable approach using local linear programs instead of SDPs\n5. An algorithm to verify CPDN for given systems\n\nThis restructured version presents the material in a clear progression from problem context to current solutions to novel contributions, making the logical flow more apparent and easier to follow.",
        "Flattening the COVID-19 infection curve is crucial for preventing healthcare systems from being overwhelmed.  A flatter curve distributes the need for healthcare over time, keeping peak hospitalizations below capacity. This means fewer people require hospitalization simultaneously, reducing strain on resources.  Flattening is achieved through pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., vaccination, medicine) and non-pharmaceutical measures (e.g., social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine).  This concept is relevant not only for COVID-19 but for any virus-based epidemic.  Flattening the curve provides more time to prepare for patient influx and allows for better individualized care, ultimately reducing the burden on healthcare services.\n\nThe effectiveness of interventions, like targeted isolation, can be influenced by the underlying structure of social networks.  Recent studies have investigated COVID-19 spread using network science and graph theory [3, 7, 21, 32], even exploring the analogy of cyber-physical malware contagion [6].  These studies analyze epidemic dynamics considering network types (e.g., scale-free, clustered scale-free, small-world) and graph-theoretic properties (e.g., clustering, small-worldness, assortativity, preferential mixing, community structures).\n\nThis paper focuses on targeted isolation within small-world networks, modeled using the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model [44].  Characterized by high clustering (dense local connections) and short path lengths (efficient global reach), these networks mirror real-world social structures. We investigate whether these characteristics are advantageous for targeted interventions.  Specifically, we examine whether identifying and isolating central individuals based on centrality measures can effectively flatten the infection curve, as suggested by theoretical [3, 11] and real-world data [33].\n\nThe literature on network science and epidemic modeling is extensive.  Studies have shown that clustering can have varying effects on disease spread, sometimes accelerating it (co-infected diseases in non-clustered networks [18]) and sometimes hindering it (hierarchical networks [17], single infection outbreaks [19]).  Other research indicates that epidemics spread faster in networks with overlapping communities [37].  The impact of clustering has also been explored by comparing scale-free and clustered scale-free networks concerning infection curve flattening [11] and epidemic outbreaks [12].  Clustering's role is further evident in social network controllability [9], Ebola transmission [36], and respiratory infection epidemics [41].  Regarding the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, research suggests community lockdowns are less effective than self-isolation and social distancing [16].  While the effect of small-worldness on infection curve flattening remains largely unexplored, some studies have examined its influence on diffusion processes [29], herd immunization [40], and epidemic outbreaks [31].\n\nOur approach relates to, but is distinct from, network immunization.  While both aim to mitigate disease impact, they employ different strategies.  Infection curve flattening focuses on slowing overall spread through population-level measures. Network immunization targets key individuals within specific networks for preventative measures.  Both strategies, however, identify and target key individuals or behaviors driving transmission.  Our method can complement network immunization as part of a comprehensive disease control strategy.  For further understanding of network immunization, readers can refer to [12, 14, 15, 25, 26, 30, 40].  Other relevant works on network immunization and epidemic control include studies on community-based control [14], bond percolation models [27], comparison of immunization strategies [45], optimized targeted immunization [42], and mitigation in multi-layer networks [24, 47].",
        "Here's the polished text, maintaining its technical accuracy while improving clarity and flow:\n\nIn wireless communication systems, a significant portion of resources is allocated to serving disadvantaged users\u2014those experiencing low path gains to the base station or access point. These users may be located in shadowed areas of the cell or inside buildings while the base station remains outdoors. Such challenging positions typically result in low-rank channels, sometimes even unit rank, which limits transmission to a single data stream.\n\nTo enhance service quality for disadvantaged users, one effective approach involves deploying repeaters that amplify and instantly retransmit signals [1]-[7]. These repeaters, also known as full-duplex relays, offer several advantages: they are compact, cost-effective to manufacture and install, and\u2014unlike distributed MIMO access points\u2014don't require phase coherency between geographically separated units.\n\nRepeaters come in two main variants: single-antenna and dual-antenna systems. Single-antenna repeaters utilize the same antenna for both reception and transmission, requiring a circulator to isolate the antenna, transmitter port, and receiver port\u2014a technically challenging configuration. Dual-antenna repeaters, which have been standardized by 3GPP as network-controlled repeaters [8], employ separate antennas for transmission and reception. A typical setup includes a donor (pickup) antenna mounted outdoors and a service antenna positioned indoors for coverage.\n\nThis discussion focuses on dual-antenna repeaters, which operate with distinct roles for each antenna: one transmits on uplink and receives on downlink, while the other performs the opposite functions, regardless of the duplexing mode. The system connects these antennas through two paths: a forward path and a reverse path, each with appropriate amplification. During TDD (Time Division Duplex) operation, the antennas' roles alternate according to the network's TDD pattern. The proposed repeater implementations introduce minimal delay, requiring only:\n\n- An amplifier circuit in each direction\n- A tunable amplitude and phase-compensation RF circuit\n- A control channel connection (either in-band or in a separate band)\n\nAdditionally, unless the antennas are sufficiently separated, the repeater requires either internal echo cancellation circuitry or a switch synchronized with the TDD pattern.",
        "The theory of stable matching, introduced by Gale and Shapley [GS62], has profoundly deepened our understanding of two-sided matching markets and inspired successful real-world market design.  Examples include marriage markets, online dating platforms, school choice programs, labor markets, and college admissions.  Using the common analogy of matching \"men\" to \"women,\" a matching is stable if no man-woman pair mutually prefers each other to their assigned partners.\n\nA fundamental challenge is characterizing the stable outcomes of these markets\u2014predicting the results agents can expect based on market characteristics. Such characterizations are crucial not only for descriptive analysis but also for effective market design.  Numerous studies have examined stable matchings in random markets, where agents' preferences are drawn uniformly at random [Pit89, KMP90, AKL17, Pit19]. This paper extends these results to scenarios where preferences are shaped by \"public scores\" representing varying levels of attractiveness, thus generalizing the uniform case. We investigate how these public scores influence market outcomes.\n\nSpecifically, we analyze a class of tiered random markets with *n* men and *n* women. Each side is partitioned into a constant number of \"soft tiers.\"  A fraction *\u03b4\u1d62* of men belong to tier *i* with public score *\u03b2\u1d62*, and a fraction *\u03b3\u1d62* of women belong to tier *i* with public score *\u03b1\u1d62*. Each agent's complete preference list is generated by sampling without replacement, proportionally to the public scores of agents on the opposite side.  For instance, a man's preference list is constructed by sequentially sampling women, without replacement, based on a distribution proportional to their public scores.  Let *\u03b1* and *\u03b2* denote the vectors of scores and *\u03b3* and *\u03b4* denote the vectors of proportions for women and men, respectively. The marginal probability of selecting a woman in tier *i* is *\u03b1\u1d62* / (*n* \u22c5 *\u03b1* \u22c5 *\u03b3*), and an analogous statement holds for men. These preferences offer a natural progression beyond uniform distributions, introducing heterogeneity in agent quality while remaining amenable to theoretical analysis.\n\nOur primary objective is to analyze the average rank of agents within each tier under the man-optimal stable matching, focusing on asymptotic behavior in large markets. An agent's rank is the index of their partner on their preference list (lower is better).  We also examine the match type distribution\u2014the fraction of tier *i* women matched to tier *j* men.\n\nFor sufficiently large markets, the following results hold within an arbitrarily small approximation factor:\n\n1.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic rigor while improving readability:\n\nA substantial body of mathematical epidemiology research has explored disease control and eradication through therapeutics and vaccinations [Nowzari et al., 2016; Behncke, 2000]. However, the 1918 influenza pandemic and the recent COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the challenges of eradicating virulent viruses, necessitating transmission reduction measures such as face masks [Chu et al., 2020], social distancing, and lockdowns [Flaxman et al., 2020; Bertuzzo et al., 2020; Di et al., 2020]. Testing has emerged as another powerful tool for limiting transmission by enabling early identification of infected individuals and epidemic hotspots [Grassly et al., 2020; OECD, 2020]. Nevertheless, during the COVID-19 pandemic, testing resources proved limited and expensive worldwide [AACC, 2020; Apuzzo and Gebredikan, 2020; Mervosh and Fernandez, 2020; Pullano et al., 2020]. In the United States, insufficient testing capacity not only facilitated virus spread but also led to underestimating the pandemic's severity in early 2020 [Fink and Baker, 2020]. Despite testing's crucial role, the optimal deployment of limited testing resources has received relatively little systematic attention.\n\nThis paper derives an optimal dynamic testing strategy within an SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) epidemic model. We begin by assuming that undetected infected individuals must be kept below a maximum threshold imax at all times, as these individuals may transmit the disease and face higher risks of serious symptoms requiring hospitalization. Our analysis reveals that the optimal testing strategy follows a simple \"most rapid approach path\" [Spence and Starrett, 1975]: no testing occurs until undetected infections reach imax, after which testing resources maintain infections at this threshold until natural decline brings the pandemic to an effective close. This approach is optimal because there is no benefit in keeping undetected infections below imax while the pandemic continues and infections cannot be reduced to zero. The resulting time-varying strategy is state-dependent, with testing levels determined by the current numbers of infected, susceptible, and recovered individuals.\n\n[Continue with similar improvements throughout the rest of the text, maintaining the academic content while enhancing clarity and flow.

        "When developing machine learning solutions for classification tasks, practitioners frequently grapple with selecting the optimal performance metric.  Consider, for example, cancer diagnosis, where a cost-sensitive predictive model categorizes patients [12].  While the chosen costs clearly influence model decisions, translating expert intuition into precise quantitative cost trade-offs\u2014that is, the performance metric itself\u2014remains a challenge [1, 13].  Hiranandani et al. [3, 4] addressed this challenge by formalizing the Metric Elicitation (ME) framework, which estimates a performance metric using user feedback on confusion matrices.  The underlying principle is that leveraging metrics reflecting a user's inherent trade-offs within a specific task, context, and population leads to models that better capture user preferences [3].  Since humans often struggle to provide accurate absolute quality feedback [10], Hiranandani et al. [3] proposed using pairwise comparisons, where a user (oracle) indicates a preference between two confusion matrices.  Figure 1 (reproduced from [3]) illustrates the ME framework.\n\nExisting ME literature proposes elicitation strategies for binary [3], multiclass [4], and multiclass-multigroup [6, 5] classification settings, all assuming an oracle providing relative preference feedback on confusion matrices. However, to the best of our knowledge, no implementations have tested the ME framework or the assumption that users can effectively compare confusion matrices. This paper bridges the gap between theory and practice by presenting the first practical implementation and evaluation of the ME framework.  Our contributions are:\n\n* We propose a visualization for pairwise comparison of confusion matrices, adapting the visualization of individual confusion matrices from Shen et al. [11].\n* We integrate this visualization into a web user interface (UI) that solicits relative preference feedback on confusion matrices.  The UI implements Algorithm 1 from Hiranandani et al.",

Robotic Operating System version 2 (ROS2), a powerful middleware, enables easy development and composition of modular software components for autonomous applications. Its benefits and vast open-source contributions have led to widespread adoption, even in time-critical systems like self-driving cars.\n\n## Current Approaches and Challenges\n### Model-Based Techniques\nRecent efforts to develop timing analysis and optimization approaches for ROS2-based applications (e.g., [1] - [5]) typically assume well-defined application models, including known execution times and precedence relations between ROS2 callbacks. However, in many industry scenarios, application developers don't provide such models, and obtaining detailed information during system integration is challenging due to confidentiality concerns.\n\n### Tracing-Based Approaches\nIn parallel, ROS2 application tracing has gained interest. The ros2 tracing framework, based on Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation (LTTng) [6], implements tracepoints in ROS2 functions to track callbacks and topics during runtime. Tools like Autoware Perf [7] and CARET [8] extend this functionality to measure various latencies, including callback response time, communication latency, and end-to-end callback-chain latency.\n\n## Proposed Framework\n### Overview\nOur framework bridges the gap between tracing and timing analysis using extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) [9]. Compared to LTTng, eBPF offers several advantages:\n- No direct instrumentation or recompilation of standard ROS2 libraries required\n- Efficient trace filtering\n- New ROS2 function probing capabilities\n- Complex data structure traversal for information extraction\n\n### Framework Components\nAs shown in Fig. 1, our framework includes three tracers:\n1. ROS2-INIT tracer: Logs ROS2 node initialization\n2. ROS2-RT tracer: Tracks callback execution and DDS topic data operations, including client callbacks and message synchronization\n3. Kernel tracer: Logs ROS2 callback-related OS scheduler events using eBPF's trace filtering\n\n### Model Synthesis\nThe framework synthesizes application timing models as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs):\n- Callbacks are modeled as tasks (vertices)\n- DDS communication forms precedence relations (edges)\n- Services with n clients are modeled using n tasks\n- m-data synchronization is modeled using m+1 tasks\n\n### Timing Analysis\nThe framework:\n- Combines ROS2 and scheduler events to measure callback execution times\n- Generates statistical information (worst-case, best-case, and average values)\n- Annotates the DAG with timing information\n\n## Applications and Benefits\nThe generated DAG can:\n- Serve as input for existing analysis and optimization tools ([1] - [5])\n- Work with any application due to ROS2 middleware-level probing\n- Be applied to real-world scenarios, as demonstrated in LIDAR-based localization in Autonomous Valet Parking\n\nThis restructured version presents a clear progression from context and background through current approaches, framework details, and practical applications, making the technical content more accessible and logically organized.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Knowledge Distillation in Neural Machine Translation: A Comparative Analysis\n\n## Introduction\n\nKnowledge distillation, a fundamental technique for model compression and knowledge transfer in deep neural networks, has wide application in neural machine translation (NMT) [Hinton et al., 2015; Gou et al., 2021]. This technique involves transferring knowledge from a larger, cumbersome model to a smaller, more efficient one, serving purposes such as compressing machine translation models and simplifying training targets for non-autoregressive models [Phuong and Lampert, 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Wang and Yoon, 2021; Xiao et al., 2023].\n\n## Types of Knowledge Distillation\n\n### Sentence-level Knowledge Distillation\n\nSentence-level knowledge distillation primarily focuses on simplifying the training target to improve translation accuracy [Gajbhiye et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2022a]. The process involves:\n1. Feeding the source sentence into the teacher model to generate a pseudo target sentence\n2. Using this pseudo target sentence as the training target for the student model\n\nThe pseudo target sentence typically has a simpler distribution than the original, making it easier for the student model to learn [Kim and Rush, 2016; Zhang et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2022].\n\n### Token-level Knowledge Distillation\n\nToken-level knowledge distillation operates at a finer granularity to enhance translation quality [Kim and Rush, 2016; Mun'im et al., 2019]. Unlike sentence-level distillation, this approach:\n- Utilizes both the output sentence and token distribution from the teacher model\n- Trains the student model to match the teacher model's distribution for each token\n- Helps the student model learn detailed token differences\n- Is particularly effective for texts with high lexical diversity [Wang et al., 2020]\n\n## Performance Analysis and Hypothesis\n\nEmpirical studies have shown varying performances between these methods across different scenarios. While some cases benefit more from sentence-level distillation's global structure and semantic consistency [Kim and Rush, 2016; Chen et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021b; Lei et al., 2022; Mhamdi et al., 2023], others require token-level distillation's fine-grained knowledge transfer [Liao et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2023].\n\nWe hypothesize that scenario complexity determines the effectiveness of each method:\n- Sentence-level distillation suits \"complex\" scenarios\n- Token-level distillation performs better in \"simple\" scenarios\n\n### Defining Scenario Complexity\n\nComplexity is determined by three factors:\n1. Student model size (smaller models create more complex scenarios)\n2. Text complexity\n3. Decoding difficulty (determined by available auxiliary information)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nTo address the challenge of empirically defining task complexity, we propose a hybrid approach featuring:\n- A dynamic gating mechanism\n- Adaptive balancing between sentence-level and token-level distillation\n- Combined learning of both pseudo target sentence distribution and detailed token distribution\n\n## Contributions\n\n1. Experimental analysis revealing optimal use cases for both distillation methods\n2. Development of a hybrid method showing enhanced performance over single distillation approaches and baseline models",
        "The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), resulting from a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a pandemic worldwide in recent times. The number of infected cases as well as the death rate is increasing rapidly, with approximately 19,000,000 people infected, 700,000 deaths, and 10,000,000 recoveries globally. The universal transmission of COVID-19 has led to widespread quarantine measures and severe impacts on various industrial sectors, causing a global financial crisis.\n\nThe most typical symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and headache. In some cases, individuals may be asymptomatic, posing a significant challenge to public health. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is the reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but resource limitations and strict testing requirements hinder fast and effective screening, leading to high false negative rates. Currently, clinical vaccines and precise drug/therapy practices are essential for combating this disease, but they are not yet available.\n\nVarious medical imaging modalities such as CT and X-ray play a crucial role in the diagnosis and control of the pandemic. CT imaging is preferred over X-rays for its versatility and three-dimensional pulmonary view, although X-rays are more affordable and widely accessible. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning and machine learning, has emerged as a valuable tool in medical image analysis for COVID-19 diagnosis. These AI technologies provide high-quality diagnostic results and help reduce the need for manual intervention.\n\nThe main objective of this paper is to review recent developments in deep learning-based COVID-19 diagnosis systems using data from medical imaging samples. The reviewed systems are classified based on pre-trained models with deep transfer learning and customized deep learning techniques. The paper also discusses key aspects of COVID-19 diagnosis systems, including the data used for experiments, data splitting techniques, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, it addresses the challenges of existing deep learning-based systems and explores future trends in this field.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section II categorizes the reviewed systems for better understanding, while Section III discusses systems for COVID-19 diagnosis using pre-trained models with deep transfer learning.",

The \"loss landscape\" shares the same number of dimensions as the weight space, plus one, since each possible DNN configuration is assessed for its loss across a set of test examples, not encountered during training.\n\nThe initial sections of this paper delve into the theoretical groundwork of the loss landscape and introduce the visualization method employed. The loss landscape, also known as the \"loss surface\" or \"objective landscape,\" is created by computing the loss of various points in the weight space, representing different DNN configurations. Subsequently, the paper presents the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) and iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) introduced by Frankle and Carbin (2019), applying the same loss visualization to the winning lottery tickets (WLTs) generated through IMP.\n\nAll the figures in the paper are linked to the same data available on the LossPlot (Bain et al., 2021) application, an in-browser tool designed specifically to visualize such surface plots. Users can manually adjust the projected contours, the radius of the clippings, and other settings within the LossPlot, which is optimized for the use of the mouse and the keyboard.",
        "The utilization of renewable energy sources (RES) presents a significant challenge for energy system operators in Australia and globally due to their variability. Maximizing the utilization of RES requires energy storage. However, large-scale battery storage is costly and pumped-hydro storage faces limitations based on geographical constraints. A promising long-term solution to integrate Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) involves establishing a new infrastructure for transporting VRE in the form of electricity and/or hydrogen (H2).\n\nCreating large-scale renewable energy hubs connected to H2 production hubs can bring substantial economies of scale by building a cost-effective VRE transport infrastructure. Designing such infrastructure requires addressing key questions like whether VRE hubs and electrolysers should be co-located, the best means to transport VRE (H2 pipelines or electricity transmission lines), and the factors influencing investment decisions. This task necessitates an integrated electricity and hydrogen system (IEHS) modeling framework to evaluate costs and benefits of various investment options.\n\nExisting knowledge and modeling tools are insufficient for such a comprehensive infrastructure design exercise. Current literature either focuses solely on the H2 supply chain or has limited consideration of infrastructure technologies. A holistic approach considering a range of transport and storage technologies within an integrated framework is crucial. This is particularly vital for large-scale renewable energy hubs, where wind and solar farms might be distant from H2 utilization sites.\n\nImportant factors often overlooked in the literature include voltage and pressure drops in infrastructure, compressor sizing, and water availability for electrolysers. Linepack modeling is critical for assessing VRE storage capacity in the H2 pipeline network, influencing the sizing of pipelines and compressors. In gas transmission networks, the modeling of time-varying accumulation rates, and the network's topology, are essential and often omitted in existing works.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel mathematical optimization model to determine the optimal integrated infrastructure for transporting large-scale VRE. The model incorporates the essential infrastructure technologies and nonlinearities, and the impact of RES variability. A mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) model, a tractable alternative to the computationally intractable large-scale nonconvex problem, is proposed. The model is applied to a range of studies and a real-world case study in Australia, and the outcomes and the methodology of the model are detailed in the subsequent sections.",
        "Optimal transport (OT) [33, 39] provides a mathematically rigorous framework for finding the most efficient way to transform one probability measure into another.  This framework yields a geometrically intuitive and robust metric on the set of probability measures known as the Wasserstein distance.  OT has become increasingly popular in machine learning, data analysis, and computer vision [19, 20], with applications spanning generative modeling [4, 21, 37], domain adaptation [11, 12], transfer learning [3, 27], supervised learning [14], clustering [16], image and point cloud registration [5, 15, 25], and even inverse problems [31].  Recently, there has been growing interest in OT for measures supported on manifolds [7, 36], driven by two key factors: (1) real-world data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, and (2) many applications, such as analyzing geophysical data or cortical signals, inherently involve non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nThis paper focuses on efficiently comparing probability measures supported on the unit circle\u2014also known as circular probability measures\u2014using the OT framework.  These measures, often represented by circular or rose histograms, are prevalent in numerous applications across computer vision, signal processing, geology, and astronomy.  For example, in computer vision, an image's color content can be captured by its hue in the HSV color space, resulting in a one-dimensional circular histogram.  Furthermore, local image/shape descriptors are often represented by circular histograms, as seen in classic computer vision techniques like SIFT [28] and Shape Context [6]. In structural geology, circular histograms represent the orientation of geological formations like bedding planes, fault lines, and joint sets [38].  Similarly, in signal processing, they represent the phase distribution of periodic signals [26], which can also be normalized and represented as circular probability density functions (PDFs).\n\nWhile extensive literature exists on circular statistics [18], the seminal works of [13] and [34] are particularly relevant, providing a thorough analysis of the OT problem and transportation distances on the circle (see also [8]).  The topic's continued relevance is highlighted by recent revisits to OT on circles [7, 17].  Unlike OT on the real line, the OT problem between probability measures on the circle generally lacks a closed-form solution. This is due to the circle's intrinsic metric and the existence of two paths (clockwise and counter-clockwise) between any two points on the circle.  However, a closed-form solution for the 2-Wasserstein distance *does* exist when one of the measures is the Lebesgue measure (i.e., the uniform distribution), which we will discuss in the Background section.\n\nWe introduce Linear Circular OT (LCOT), a novel transport-based distance for circular probability measures.  LCOT leverages the closed-form solution of the circular 2-Wasserstein distance between each distribution and the uniform distribution on the circle, thereby circumventing the need for optimization.  Specifically, we determine the Monge maps that push the uniform distribution to each input measure using this closed-form solution.  The distance between the input measures is then based on the differences between their respective Monge maps.",
        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) faces significant challenges, one of which is the automatic processing of large volumes of unstructured textual data. A crucial subfield addressing this issue is Natural Language Processing (NLP), which involves developing algorithms to process, analyze, and understand extensive text or speech data in human language. Within the biomedical domain, the application of these methods is referred to as Clinical NLP (cNLP). This subfield focuses on analyzing, manipulating, and interrogating clinical narratives. \n\nIn radiology, a substantial amount of textual data is generated daily, primarily in the form of free-text reports, such as transcriptions. Recognizing the need for the adoption of structured reporting (SR) in clinical practice, many medical societies, including the European Society of Radiology and the Radiological Society of North America, advocate the creation of reference registries. Responding to these needs, the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) has designed structured reports for CT scans of patients with oncological conditions, such as breast, lung, colon, rectum, lymphoma, pancreas, and stomach cancers, as well as COVID-19. Despite these efforts, the rapid creation of unstructured clinical information necessitates the development of NLP solutions to transform existing reports into structured, manageable, and interpretable formats.",
        "Most traditional autonomous navigation systems excel at moving robots between points with collision-free guarantees, based on specific parameters (e.g., maximum speed, sampling rate, inflation radius) tailored for the deployment setting. However, adjusting these parameters for new environments demands additional time, energy, and specialized knowledge of the system [1], [2].\n\nTo address the challenges of expert re-tuning in diverse environments, recent efforts have focused on learning adaptive parameter tuning from demonstrations [3]. While this approach eliminates the need for expert tuning, it relies on human demonstrations and the learned parameters are usually only suitable for the training environment. Furthermore, the system's performance is often constrained by the quality of the human demonstration, which may not be optimal.\n\nIn this study, we aim to develop a novel method for adaptive autonomous navigation that doesn't require expert tuning or human demonstrations and is applicable across various deployment environments. We propose that utilizing reinforcement learning in simulation can achieve these objectives and test this hypothesis by introducing and analyzing Adaptive Planner Parameter Learning from Reinforcement (APPLR). Through reinforcement learning, APPLR introduces a parameter policy (see Fig. 1) trained to make planner parameter decisions. This approach enables the system to take suboptimal actions at one point to potentially enhance future performance. For instance, while slowing down or adjusting the trajectory before a turn might seem suboptimal initially, it can lead to better positioning for future speed gains. Unlike an end-to-end motion policy that maps states to low-level commands, APPLR's parameter policy collaborates with a classical motion planner, ensuring the system retains the advantages of traditional methods such as safety and explainability. We argue that employing policies that operate in the parameter space of an existing motion planner, rather than in the velocity control space, can enhance exploration safety, boost learning efficiency, generalize effectively to new environments, and facilitate successful simulation-to-real transfer.",
        "The term \"Software Engineering\" was coined in 1968 at a conference aimed at discussing the need for the software development discipline to be more strongly based on theoretical and engineering principles (Naur and Randell, 1969). The Waterfall model, a then-popular model used in manufacturing, was initially adopted as the standard approach for developing computer software. However, over time, it became evident that a strict implementation of this model was not suitable for software development. Various modifications, such as the Spiral model (Boehm, 1988), and alternative models like XP (Beck, 2000), emerged. The authors of these models hold different perspectives on software development. Earlier models treat software development as an engineering activity and emphasize control, while more recent models focus on effective communication and view software as a service.\n\nDespite the significant variation in approach, until recently, it was widely believed among methodology architects that strict adherence to their approach, without additions or omissions, was essential for effectiveness (Cusumano et al., 2003). However, industry experiences have shown that this belief does not align with real-world practices. There has been advocacy for a deeper understanding of the software development process to support industry in flexibly selecting practices based on objectives and context (Bajec et al., 2007; Fitzgerald, 1997; Hansson et al., 2009; Kirk and Tempero, 2004; Kirk and Tempero, 2005; Kirk, 2007).\n\nThis viewpoint has now become widely accepted (Avison and Pries-Heje, 2008; MacCormack et al., 2012; Petersen and Wohlin, 2009; de Azevedo Santos et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2010). The notion that methodologies and practices must be strictly followed has been replaced by the understanding that customization is essential. To achieve effective tailoring, a thorough comprehension of the relationships between objectives, process, and context is crucial.\n\nThe role of theory in software engineering (SE) has been explored from various angles. It has been noted that there is limited emphasis on theories in software engineering (Sj\u00f8berg et al., 2008). The need for theory-building to accumulate knowledge applicable in diverse settings has been emphasized. While there is consensus on the benefits of focusing on theory building, uncertainties remain on how to proceed.\n\nOur research aims to apply an ontological approach to develop a conceptual model describing software initiatives, referring to the software-related processes implemented to achieve specific outcomes. Establishing such a model would aid the software industry in selecting suitable practices aligned with organizational objectives and contexts. Before formalizing a software initiative conceptually, a deeper understanding of the foundational constructs is necessary. This paper outlines our progress in this pursuit. Section 2 provides an overview of our progress to date, section 3 discusses efforts in establishing a theoretical foundation for software development, and section 4 summarizes the paper, discussing limitations and outlining future work.",
        "The Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) plays a crucial role in environmental monitoring, land surveys, detailed investigations of sensitive areas, and various other fields. The problem of satellite mission planning and scheduling mainly consists of two parts: data acquisition task scheduling and data downlink scheduling. Data acquisition involves capturing images, while data downlink refers to transmitting the stored imaging data to receiving resources, such as ground stations, as depicted in Figure 1. This process can involve complete or partial imaging data, or a combination of both.\n\nWith advancements in space technology, satellite imaging capabilities have significantly improved, leading to a surge in imaging data. The launch of GAOFEN II in 2014 ushered in the \"submeter Era\" for EOS in China, showcasing enhanced imaging capabilities. However, the downlink capacity of satellite antennas has not progressed at the same pace. For instance, the downlink rate of the GAOFEN II antenna is only 2,450 Mbps, creating a significant gap between data acquisition and data download capabilities.\n\nThe discrepancy between data acquisition and download capabilities presents a new challenge for Satellite Data Downlink Scheduling Problem (SDSP). Various studies have delved into different aspects of SDSP, focusing on single satellites, satellite constellations, time-switch constraints, resource constraints, and uncertainty in imaging data. Different optimization algorithms, such as ant colony algorithms, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithms, and hybrid genetic algorithms, have been proposed to tackle the complexities of SDSP.\n\nMost research on SDSP revolves around resource allocation for playback windows and resolving conflicts between them. A common assumption in these studies is the \"First observed, First downlink (FOFD)\" order for transmitting images. However, the assumption that one playback window can transmit multiple images becomes impractical due to the significant gap between data acquisition and download capabilities.\n\nThis paper introduces the Satellite Data Downlink Scheduling Problem under Breakpoint Resume Mode (SDSP-BRM), which allows for pausing and resuming image data transmission. This mode enables the division of a single image into smaller pieces, adding a layer of complexity to the traditional SDSP. SDSP-BRM surpasses the complexity of Satellite Range Scheduling Problem (SRSP) and SDSP, both of which are known to be NP-Hard.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the mathematical formulation and complexity analysis of SDSP-BRM. In Section 3, a Simple and Effective Heuristic Algorithm (SEHA) is introduced to solve SDSP-BRM. Experimental results and analysis are presented in Section 4, while Section 5 concludes the paper.",
        "Ray tracing involves testing each ray against each polygon in a scene, resulting in a large number of intersection tests per frame. To address this performance bottleneck, optimizations such as Object Hierarchies and Spatial Hierarchies are commonly used. However, the focus of our work lies in exploring Ray Hierarchies as a means of enhancing ray tracing efficiency, complementing the existing Object-Spatial Hierarchies. In this paper, we introduce the Coherent Ray-Space Hierarchy (CRSH) algorithm, which builds upon the Ray-Space Hierarchy (RSH) and Ray-Sorting techniques.\n\nThe Ray-Space Hierarchy, developed by Roger et al., utilizes a tree structure containing bounding sphere-cones that enclose a local set of rays. Our CRSH algorithm integrates Ray-Sorting, as described by Garanzha and Loop, to enhance efficiency within each tree node. Additionally, we incorporate whole mesh culling and refined hashing methods to further optimize the hierarchy and reduce the number of intersection tests. By enhancing the coherency of rays within each tree node, we aim to generate tighter bounding sphere-cones, ultimately minimizing ray-geometry intersections.\n\nSpecialized ray hashing methods, tailored to different ray types such as shadow, reflection, and refraction, are employed to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchy. Furthermore, the introduction of whole mesh bounding spheres at the hierarchy's top level aids in reducing the number of intersection tests. Notably, the technique leverages rasterization for primary intersections, reserving ray tracing for secondary interactions, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the algorithm.\n\nThe key contributions of our work include the development of a compact, ray-indexing, and ray-sorting-based Ray-Space Hierarchy, the innovative integration of ray-sorting with ray-space hierarchy, and the efficient culling of entire meshes from the hierarchy, optimizing the final ray-primitive traversal. By combining these techniques, the Coherent Ray-Space Hierarchy algorithm offers a refined, efficient, and effective approach to ray tracing, paving the way for enhanced rendering performance, particularly in the context of complex, ray-intensive scenes.",
        "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine a generative language model with a non-parametric datastore, often outperforming larger purely parametric models in language modeling (Borgeaud et al., 2022). They excel in handling knowledge-intensive tasks (Lewis et al., 2020), modeling long-tail knowledge (Mallen et al., 2023), and providing attribution of the generated text to identified sources (Bohnet et al., 2022).\n\nA particularly appealing feature of RAG systems is their ability to update a model's world knowledge without costly retraining. These systems enable the model to update its knowledge based on retrieved documents. Language models using RAG can rely on the facts they have memorized during the pre-training stage\u2014their parametric knowledge (Petroni et al., 2019). Alternatively, they can draw on the contextual knowledge from retrieved documents. When the two sources of knowledge contradict each other, it is referred to as a knowledge conflict, or context-memory conflict (Longpre et al., 2021). A knowledge update occurs when the model changes its original parametric response upon encountering a conflicting context.\n\nKnowledge conflicts arise in three significant RAG applications. Firstly, pre-training a large language model takes months (Touvron et al., 2023a; b), during which time factual information may become outdated. Secondly, in the current transfer learning paradigm (Bommasani et al., 2021), most end users do not train models from scratch. Instead, they rely on a few pre-trained models and adapt them to downstream tasks through fine-tuning, prompting, or retrieval augmentation. These downstream tasks are diverse and often require factual knowledge that significantly differs from the pre-training data. Thirdly, language models are pre-trained on large-scale text corpora that might contain unreliable information (Bommasani et al., 2021, Section 4.6). Failing to update parametric knowledge with correct domain-specific information poses a significant risk to the end user.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow:\n\n# Neural Control Variates for Monte Carlo Integration\n\n## Introduction and Background\n\nMonte Carlo (MC) integration provides a simple numerical approach for solving complex integration problems. However, its main limitation is the relatively slow convergence rate, manifesting as high variance in MC estimators. While various techniques like antithetic sampling, stratification, quasi-random sampling, and importance sampling have been developed to improve efficiency through careful sample placement, additional variance reduction can be achieved through hierarchical integration or control variates. This article focuses on the latter approach, presenting parametric control variates based on neural networks.\n\n## Control Variate Fundamentals\n\nThe control variate (CV) approach reduces variance by utilizing an approximate solution of the integral, corrected by an estimate of the approximation error. This is expressed by the following identity:\n\n[EQUATION]\n\nInstead of directly integrating function f to obtain F, we leverage an \u03b1-scaled approximation G, derived from integrating a control variate function g over domain D. The approximation error is then corrected by adding the integral of the difference f(x)-\u03b1\u2022g(x).\n\nThe effectiveness of this approach depends on:\n1. The scaled control variate making integration easier (e.g., by smoothing the integrand)\n2. The correlation between f and g\n3. Proper selection of the scaling coefficient \u03b1 based on function correlation\n\n## Neural Control Variate Implementation\n\nWe propose inferring the control variate g from observations of f using machine learning. The key challenge is representing g in a form that allows efficient computation of its integral, G = \u222bg(x)dx. Our solution:\n\n1. Decompose the control variate g(x) into:\n   - Normalized shape g(x)\n   - Integral G\n   Such that g(x) = g(x) \u2022 G\n\n2. Model the shape and integral independently using:\n   - Neural networks for integral G and coefficient \u03b1\n   - A specialized variant of normalizing flows for the shape g\n\n## Integration with Neural Importance Sampling\n\nWhile well-designed control variates reduce the energy in the residual integral, the residual integrand may still be challenging to sample with traditional distributions. We address this by:\n\n1. Employing neural importance sampling (NIS) for handling arbitrary integrands\n2. Developing a combined estimator utilizing both NCV and NIS\n3. Deriving two loss functions:\n   - A theoretically optimal version\n   - A robust practical version for noisy optimization\n\n## Applications in Light Transport Simulation\n\nThe method shows particular promise in light-transport simulations governed by Fredholm integral equations. Key advantages include:\n\n1. Reduced path vertex construction due to lower energy in difference integrals\n2. Efficient handling of spectral path tracing through:\n   - Multiple control variates for different spectral bands\n   - A novel normalizing flow for correlated control variates\n   - Reduced spectral noise compared to scalar-based importance sampling\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. Tractable neural control variate model\n2. Multi-channel normalizing flow for spectral integrands\n3. Combined NCV-NIS estimator with:\n   - Variance-optimal loss function\n   - Stable empirical composite loss\n4. Practical light-transport simulator with heuristic residual integral estimation\n\nThis restructuring provides a clearer progression from fundamental concepts to practical implementation and applications, while maintaining the technical depth of the original text.",
        "Infectious diseases such as seasonal influenza and COVID-19 pose significant global health challenges, impacting millions worldwide. Forecasting disease time-series, like the number of infected cases across different time frames and locations, is both complex and crucial. Predicting indicators such as future incidence, peak timing and intensity, and disease onset provides policymakers with valuable lead time for planning interventions and optimizing supply chain decisions. This approach is evident in various prediction initiatives by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for diseases like dengue, influenza, and COVID-19.\n\nStatistical approaches to forecasting are relatively new compared to traditional mechanistic models. Although mechanistic models are useful for generating 'what-if' scenarios, they face challenges in real-time forecasting, as they struggle to incorporate data from multiple indicators or predict composite signals. On the other hand, deep learning approaches represent a promising avenue. They can process a vast array of data signals without the need for intensive feature engineering.\n\nHowever, designing these models presents several challenges, particularly regarding the need to handle uncertainty for more reliable forecasts. Decision-makers must understand the inherent uncertainties in forecasts to make robust decisions. Providing probabilistic forecasts and interpreting the sources of model uncertainty can also aid in effectively communicating the situation to the public. Due to the inherent complexity of the prediction problem, as with weather forecasting, 'point' forecasts without uncertainty are increasingly viewed as inadequate for planning high-stakes decisions.\n\nQuantifying uncertainty in purely statistical epidemic forecasting models is a largely unexplored field. Most traditional methods focus solely on the accuracy of point estimates. While some approaches model the underlying generative distribution of the data to provide a probability distribution of the outputs, they do not necessarily produce calibrated distributions. Another line of research addresses uncertainty by using simple methods, such as ensemble models, to build a sample of forecasts and uncertainty bounds. Recent attempts in deep learning forecasting models often employ ad-hoc methods, such as bootstrap sampling, while others overlook this aspect entirely. Consequently, these methods can lead to highly inaccurate predictions, especially in novel or atypical scenarios, and may display undue confidence in these errors.",
        "The Minimum-Weight Odd T-Join problem (MOTJ) seeks a minimum-weight T-join of odd cardinality, given a subset T of vertices in an undirected, edge-weighted graph.  MOTJ is a special case of binary hypergraph optimization, a field encompassing related graph problems, including open cases of Max Cut and certain multiflow problems. While stimulating minimax conjectures by Seymour have been resolved in special cases (e.g., Guenin and Abdi [1, 2, 16]), optimization algorithms, even for cases where Seymour's conjectures hold, have remained elusive.\n\nThis paper examines several interconnected optimization problems in undirected, edge-weighted graphs involving parity constraints on edge sets.  These problems fall under the general framework of \"binary hypergraphs\" [22, Chapter 80], a subject of extensive research and numerous deep results and conjectures since the 1970s (e.g., [1, 2, 11, 15, 16, 24]; those predating 2002 are summarized in Schrijver [22]).  Initial studies focused on problems like T-joins and odd cycles with non-negative edge weights [10, 13].  Subsequently, research expanded to incorporate additional binary constraints [11, 15, 16], leading to new results and challenges.\n\nThis work addresses key algorithmic challenges.  We study finding a minimum-weight odd T-join (MOTJ), a shortest odd cycle (SOC), and a shortest odd path between two vertices (SOP) in undirected graphs with conservative weights (i.e., allowing negative weights but no negative-weight cycles).  Our results are:\n\n(a) The SOC variant requiring the solution to contain a given vertex is NP-hard, implying NP-hardness for SOP. The latter's complexity has been an open question posed by Lov\u00e1sz (Open Problem 27 in Schrijver [22]) for over two decades.\n\n(b) MOTJ with non-negative weights can be solved in 2<sup>|T|/2</sup>O(n<sup>4</sup>) time on an n-vertex graph. Our method exploits structural properties of shortest cycles in graphs with conservative weights, yielding an efficient SOC algorithm when negative-weight edges span a bounded number of components.\n\n(c)  SOC with conservative weights is polynomially equivalent to MOTJ. While we solve certain special cases in polynomial time, the general case remains open.\n\nWe also prove that finding two openly disjoint paths of minimum total weight between two vertices in an undirected graph with conservative weights is NP-hard, a problem that, surprisingly, has also been open.  Our findings significantly contribute to clarifying the relationships among a previously disparate set of influential problems, categorizing them into polynomial-time solvable, open, and NP-hard cases (cf. (a), (b), and (c), respectively).  We further demonstrate that some analogous directed graph problems are easily reducible to tractable problems, while others are equivalent to the NP-hard problems identified here (see Sections 4 and 5).  New related open problems also emerge (see Section 5.3).  The SOP problem encompasses the following classical problem, SP:",
        "Multi-media generation with diffusion models has attracted extensive attention recently. Following breakthroughs in image and audio generation, multi-media generation like video remains challenging due to increased data and content size and the added complexity of dealing with both audio and visual components. Challenges for generating multi-modal content include time variant feature maps leading to computationally expensive architecture and the requirement for audio and video to be coherent and synchronized in terms of semantics and temporal alignment.\n\nExisting research has predominantly concentrated on unidirectional cross-modal generation, such as producing audio from video cues and vice versa. These approaches typically employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a conditional data distribution p(x|y). Although these models have shown considerable promise, their unidirectional nature is a limitation. However, Bayes' theorem suggests that a joint distribution can encompass bi-directional conditional distributions. Classifier guidance has emerged as a viable approach for training an unconditional model capable of conditional generation and has been extensively adopted in addressing the inverse problems associated with diffusion models.\n\nMM-diffusion represents a groundbreaking foray into the simultaneous modeling of video and audio content. However, the model's computational complexity and the need for improvement in conditional generation performance and analysis present challenges. In this study, we introduce an improved multi-modal diffusion architecture for bi-directional conditional generation of video and audio. Our model integrates video and audio data more effectively and uses a novel joint contrastive diffusion loss to enhance alignment between video and audio pairs, resulting in superior quality and synchronization without loss.\n\nThe key contributions of our study include an optimized multi-modal latent-spectrogram diffusion model and a novel contrastive loss function tailored for the joint model to enhance the alignment accuracy for conditional generation of video and audio pairs. Our extensive experimental evaluations, performed on the AIST++ and EPIC-Sound datasets, demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing and non-contrastive variants, and the improved performance and synchronization achieved.",
        "The question of whether randomized algorithms offer a fundamental advantage over deterministic ones is a central problem in computer science, encapsulated by the unresolved conjecture P = BPP.  P represents problems solvable deterministically in polynomial time, while BPP encompasses problems solvable by randomized algorithms in polynomial time with bounded error probability.  The prevailing belief is that P = RP = CoRP = BPP, suggesting randomness offers no significant advantage. This belief stems from deep connections between complexity theory, circuit lower bounds, and pseudorandom generators.\n\nWhile a direct proof of P = BPP remains elusive, a more manageable approach is to focus on specific problems with known randomized but unknown deterministic polynomial-time algorithms.  One such problem is the Exact Matching problem (Em), introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in 1982.  Em asks whether, given a graph with red and blue edges and an integer k, a perfect matching exists with exactly k red edges.  Mulmuley et al. demonstrated a randomized polynomial-time solution in 1987, yet a deterministic counterpart remains undiscovered.  Each \"derandomization\" of a randomized algorithm provides further evidence towards the validity of P = BPP.  A prominent example is the deterministic primality testing algorithm developed by Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena in 2002.\n\nInterestingly, Em is connected to another problem in BPP lacking a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm: Polynomial Identity Testing (Pit).  Pit determines if a given polynomial, represented by an algebraic circuit, is identically zero.  The Schwartz-Zippel Lemma places Pit within CoRP, implying a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm should exist if CoRP = P. However, Kabanets and Impagliazzo suggest derandomizing Pit is difficult, potentially requiring breakthroughs in proving circuit lower bounds.  Existing randomized algorithms for Em utilize Pit as a subroutine or employ the Isolation Lemma, both placing Em within RP.\n\nEm has seen deterministic polynomial-time solutions on specific graph classes, including bounded tree-width graphs, K3,3-minor free graphs, and graphs of bounded genus, often employing Pfaffian orientations.  Approximation results also exist, such as Yuster's deterministic algorithm for finding almost exact matchings in YES-instances.\n\nDespite the lack of a complete derandomization, Em remains relevant.  Over the past decade, it has appeared in various contexts, including budgeted, color-bounded, and constrained matching; multicriteria optimization; matroid intersection; binary linear equation systems; recoverable robust assignment; and planarizing gadgets for perfect matchings.  A full derandomization of Em would often derandomize related results in these areas.  Its inclusion as an open problem in influential work on the parallel computation complexity of the matching problem has further contributed to its continued relevance.  This sustained interest underscores the importance of Em within theoretical computer science and the ongoing pursuit of a deterministic solution.",
        "To improve the logical flow and coherence of the text, I've restructured the content by grouping related ideas together and ensuring a smooth transition between sections. Here's the revised version:\n\n---\n\nSign languages are the native languages of the Deaf and their primary medium of communication. As visual languages, they utilize multiple complementary channels, known as articulators, to convey information. This includes manual features such as hand shape, movement, and pose, as well as non-manual features like facial expressions, mouth movements, and the movement of the head, shoulders, and torso.\n\nThe goal of sign language translation is to either convert written language into a video of signs (production) or to extract an equivalent spoken language sentence from a video of someone performing continuous sign. However, in the field of computer vision, much of the work has focused on recognizing the sequence of sign glosses (Continuous Sign Language Recognition, CSLR) rather than the full translation to a spoken language equivalent (Sign Language Translation, SLT). This distinction is crucial because the grammar of sign and spoken languages is very different. These differences include different word ordering, the use of multiple channels to convey concurrent information, and the use of direction and space to convey relationships between objects. Simply put, the mapping between speech and sign is complex, and there is no straightforward word-to-sign mapping.\n\nGenerating spoken language sentences from sign language videos is a spatio-temporal machine translation task. Such a translation system requires solving several sub-tasks, which are currently unsolved:\n\n1. **Sign Segmentation**: The system needs to detect sign sentences, commonly formed using topic-comment structures, from continuous sign language videos. This is trivial for text-based machine translation tasks, where punctuation marks separate sentences. Speech-based recognition and translation systems look for pauses, such as silent regions, between phonemes to segment spoken language utterances.",

        "To improve the logical flow and coherence of the text, I have rearranged the sections and sentences to enhance clarity and fluency. Here is the revised text:\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Differential Privacy and Its Challenges**\n\nPrivacy in the digital economy is critical, particularly for end-users who share their personal data [1]. Differential privacy (DP) is the de-facto standard for privacy protection; however, it often results in diminished data utility. This trade-off between privacy and utility is a long-standing issue in differential privacy.\n\n**Shuffle Model: Bridging Privacy and Utility**\n\nAn intermediate paradigm between the central and local models of DP, known as the shuffle model [2], has recently gained popularity. Initially, the shuffle model uses a local mechanism to perturb data individually, similar to the local model of DP. After this local sanitization, a shuffler uniformly permutes the noisy data to unlink them from the corresponding data providers. This approach allows the shuffle model to achieve a DP guarantee using less noise than the local model, thus providing better utility while retaining privacy. Consequently, the shuffle model offers an advantage in managing the trade-off between privacy and utility within the digital economy.\n\n**Analytical Exploration of the Shuffle Model**\n\nThe privacy guarantees provided by the shuffle model have been rigorously studied, with various analytical and numerical results emerging. Analytical bounds offer a concrete basis for reasoning and mathematical analysis of properties like the privacy-utility trade-off. However, most analytical bounds for the shuffle model found in the literature are not tight. In this paper, we bridge this gap by deriving tight necessary and sufficient conditions for the tightest (\u01eb, \u03b4)-bounds of the DP guarantee provided by the shuffle model with the k-randomized response (k-RR) local mechanism.\n\n**Framework for Tight Privacy Guarantees**\n\nWe incorporate the concept of privacy blankets introduced by Balle et al. in [3] and the idea of (\u01eb, \u03b4)-adaptive differential privacy (ADP) proposed by Sommer et al. in [4]. Definition 1.1 outlines differential privacy [5, 6], while Definition 1.2 details adaptive differential privacy (ADP). These definitions provide the foundation for our theoretical analysis.\n\n**Analysis of Privacy Blanket Tightness**\n\nBalle et al. in [3] introduced privacy blankets for shuffle models, deriving privacy estimates in terms of (\u01eb, \u03b4)-DP. However, they did not establish a theoretical condition for ensuring the tightness of these privacy blankets. In contrast, Sommer et al. [4] provided an explicit condition for a tight (\u01eb, \u03b4)-ADP, crucial for comparing utilities between shuffle models and other privacy mechanisms. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure a tight privacy blanket for the shuffle model with the k-RR mechanism as the local randomizer. By aligning these conditions with Lemma 5 of [4], we ensure a tight (\u01eb, \u03b4)-DP guarantee for the shuffle model.\n\n**Mathematical Conditions and Critical Polynomial Analysis**\n\nFor effective privacy-utility analysis, we identify conditions under which the result of Balle et al. [3] ensures a tight differential privacy guarantee. We explore two cases from Lemma 5 [4] for different privacy parameters and derive critical polynomials to aid in this analysis. Definitions 2.1 and 2.2 introduce the critical polynomial and critical equation, providing the mathematical groundwork for Theorems 2.1 and 2.2, which confirm asymptotic tightness.\n\n**Discussion and Future Work**\n\nThis work offers analytical insights into the conditions for obtaining optimal privacy guarantees for shuffle models using k-RR local randomizers. Exploring the space of tight DP guarantees for shuffle models could lead to significant advancements in privacy-preserving data analysis by optimizing the utility for given privacy levels. Future research will explore generalized shuffle models with various local randomizers and their application in digital markets, potentially influencing data pricing mechanisms based on privacy amplification by shuffling [9, 10].",
        "The emergence of deep learning has raised concerns about the opacity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and their impact on public and private life. Governments are now taking steps to protect people's rights and regulate the AI industry to prevent potential abuse. Initiatives like the EU's GDPR aim to ensure transparency, fairness, accountability, and trustworthiness in AI technologies. Research on explainable AI (XAI) seeks to address these issues by using automated explanations to enhance the transparency of black-box models and ensure fairness in decision-making processes.\n\nCounterfactual explanations have garnered significant research interest in the field of XAI, with a recent survey paper highlighting the growing body of literature on this topic. These explanations aim to justify algorithmic decisions after the fact, showing how changes in input features can alter the output decision of an AI system. In contrast, semi-factual explanations represent a special case of counterfactuals, revealing feature changes that do not influence decision outcomes. While some debate exists on the distinction between semi-factuals and outcome-counterfactuals, their psychological impacts have been shown to differ.\n\nSemi-factual explanations offer various benefits similar to those of counterfactual explanations, including legal, psychological, and technical advantages. For instance, in the medical field, a semi-factual explanation could inform a medical professional that even if a tumor were half its size, it would still require surgical intervention. The ability of semi-factuals to convey causal relationships and provide insights into decision-making processes makes them valuable tools in explaining complex AI systems.\n\nThis paper provides a systematic review of prior work on semi-factual explanations in the Cognitive Sciences and AI domains. It begins with examples from early literature in Philosophy and Psychology, defines desiderata for semi-factuals, reports the results of a systematic survey, outlines the history of semi-factual algorithms, and presents benchmarking studies using historical algorithms and a newly proposed na\u00a8\u0131ve benchmark. The contributions of this paper include a comprehensive survey of relevant literature, a set of desiderata for semi-factual XAI, a benchmark algorithm based on the concept of Most Distant Neighbors (MDNs), comparative tests of historical benchmarks, and a repository of metrics, data, and results for future reference in the field of XAI.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nIn 1952, Claude Shannon unveiled an electromechanical mouse that could navigate its way out of a maze built on a 5 \u00d7 5 grid. Named 'Theseus' after the mythical hero who escaped an intricate labyrinth following his defeat of the Minotaur, this device is widely considered the first autonomous mobile robot [Klein, 2018]. Shannon's creation sparked numerous micro-mouse competitions worldwide.\n\nThe navigation algorithm powering Shannon's mouse is now known as 'depth-first search.' Its origins can be traced back to Lucas [1883], making it one of the rare algorithms that predates computer science itself.\n\nDepth-first search is an evolution of the ancient maze-solving technique known as 'right-hand-on-the-wall,' which works effectively in cycle-free environments (trees). When equipped with the ability to mark previously explored nodes (such as with chalk), an agent using depth-first search will traverse each edge twice\u2014once in each direction\u2014before returning to its starting point. In contemporary terms, this achieves graph exploration in 2m moves, where m represents the number of edges in the graph. According to Miyazaki et al. [2009], the algorithm is optimal in terms of competitive analysis.\n\n**Main Results**\n\nIn the original myth, Theseus succeeds with help from the clever Ariadne. This paper first examines whether two agents, starting from the same node, can solve a maze more efficiently than a single agent. Using the collective exploration framework introduced by Fraigniaud et al. [2006], we demonstrate that they can. Our primary contribution is a collective graph exploration algorithm for two agents that requires exactly m timesteps to explore any tree with m edges.",
        "Supervised learning typically assumes that each training sample in a dataset is labeled, allowing the classifier to be trained using these labels as instance-level supervision signals. However, in many practical scenarios, obtaining instance-level labels is challenging due to the complexity and labor-intensive nature of labeling each individual instance. In such cases, a label is assigned to a group of instances instead, a problem known as multi-instance learning (MIL) [3]. For example, in whole slide image (WSI) analysis [5, 7], images often have extremely large dimensions, and typically, the entire image is assigned a single label, while region-level annotations are rarely provided [2].\n\nRecently, Ilse et al. [8] introduced an attention-based MIL model fully parameterized by neural networks. Both the aggregation operator and the feature extractor are end-to-end trainable, allowing them to aggregate instance embeddings into a bag embedding. The model's attention mechanism assigns a score to each instance embedding, and the final classifier operates on a bag embedding, which is a gated sum of the instance embeddings. The attention score indicates the likelihood of an instance being the key trigger for the bag classifier. Subsequently, [14, 18, 12] proposed using a self-attention mechanism [17] to further consider dependencies between instance embeddings. However, computing the self-attention matrix across all instance embeddings in a bag is computationally complex and may yield redundant information that does not contribute useful supervisory signals. More importantly, both MIL models face challenges in solving clinical WSI image classification problems, where WSIs produce tens of thousands of patches. The memory requirements for training a deep CNN-based feature extractor, along with the aggregation operator, necessitate gradients to flow through the CNN for all patches, which hinders the training of the bag embedding-based model.\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that cross-matching all queries in self-attention for MIL is suboptimal, and matching using only the top-activated queries not only reduces computational complexity but also enhances classification performance. We propose a novel dual-stream MIL (DSMIL) model, parameterized by neural networks, that jointly learns an instance classifier and a bag classifier. The first stream of the model employs standard MIL max pooling to determine the top-activated embeddings. In the second stream, the attention score is computed across instances by correlating only the top-activated queries with the instances in the bag. The proposed maximum self-attention requires a computational complexity of O(n) compared to a full self-attention between each pair of instance embeddings, which is O(n\u00b2), and provides clearer supervisory signals to each instance.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow:\n\n# Statistical Parameter Estimation and Empirical Bayes Theory\n\n## Introduction to the Problem\nConsider estimating an unknown parameter \u03b8 \u2208 R 10 from a single measurement Y \u223c N (\u03b8, I 10 ). The observed data is Y = [1.08, -2.43, 1.52, -1.17, 1.39, 8.3, 10.02, 10.61, 9.3, 10.14].\n\n## Traditional Approaches and Their Limitations\nWhile worst-case reasoning suggests using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) \u03b8 = Y, shrinkage estimators like James-Stein have proven more advantageous. In this particular example, applying the James-Stein estimator separately to the first 5 coordinates and the remaining coordinates would be even more beneficial, as shrinking to a common mean across all 10 coordinates seems unnatural given the bimodal distribution.\n\n## The Empirical Bayes Framework\nThese observations lead to two fundamental questions:\n1. How can we formally derive such clever procedures?\n2. What are their fundamental limits?\n\nBoth questions were addressed in Robbins' decision-theoretic framework [Rob51, Rob56], known as empirical Bayes. This methodology has since gained widespread adoption in large-scale data analysis, particularly in:\n- Computational biology and microarrays [ETST01]\n- Sports prediction [Bro08]\n\n## Core Principles and Current Research\nThe fundamental principle of empirical Bayes theory reveals that with a large number of independent observations, it's possible to \"borrow strength\" from these seemingly unrelated observations to achieve optimal Bayes risk per coordinate asymptotically.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Introduction and Background\nMobility analysis - understanding and modeling people's movement patterns - is crucial for urban planning and infrastructure investment. Traditionally, this information came from household travel surveys, which despite providing rich data, are expensive ($250-350 per household), limited in sample size (~0.1% of regional population), and conducted infrequently.\n\n# Evolution of Mobility Data Collection\nThe past two decades have seen mobile device data emerge as a powerful alternative to traditional surveys. This data offers several advantages:\n- Large sample sizes (hundreds of thousands to millions)\n- Extended time coverage (weeks to years)\n- Key information: geographical locations and timestamps\n\n# Challenges in Mobile Data Processing\nUnlike self-reported travel surveys, mobile data requires significant pre-processing and analysis to infer trips and patterns. This is because:\n1. Data quality varies based on user patterns\n2. Different positioning technologies affect accuracy\n3. Pre-processing is needed to correct data issues\n4. Analysis methods vary among researchers\n\n# Impact of Different Analysis Methods\nThe choice of processing methods can significantly affect results. For example, two similar clustering algorithms using identical thresholds can produce vastly different mobility patterns (as illustrated in Figure 1).\n\n# The Need for Standardization\nThis sensitivity to methodology creates challenges for:\n- Policy making\n- Comparative analysis\n- Research reproducibility\n\n# Proposed Solution: Mobility Analysis Workflow (MAW)\nThe study proposes MAW as a standardized approach supporting four key properties:\n1. Accessibility: Easy-to-install software with documentation\n2. Interoperability: Cross-platform compatibility\n3. Reproducibility: Consistent results across systems\n4.",
        "Economic issues, including inflation, energy costs, taxes, and interest rates, are a constant in our daily lives.  These challenges have been amplified by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental disasters, geopolitical tensions, and armed conflicts.  These concerns are shared by experts, the media, politicians, and the public alike.  In the US, for example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including its variants and vaccination efforts), labor shortages, supply chain vulnerabilities, Federal Reserve policies, and US-China relations were identified as key economic risks in 2022.  Globally, inflation, weak consumer spending, the economic impact of climate change, rising labor costs, European gas supplies, and food security are major sources of anxiety.\n\nOur societies and workplaces are becoming increasingly diverse yet simultaneously more divided.  This growing separation along lines of age, gender, race, and ideology has fueled polarization and conflict within communities, even impacting areas like sports, traditionally seen as a unifying force. This level of complexity and division is relatively novel, representing a significant departure from past experiences.",
        "The rapid growth of medical digitalization has led to an explosion of medical documentation, including electronic medical records, reports, and other formats.  Extracting information from this data, particularly through medical named entity recognition (NER), is increasingly crucial for applications like knowledge graph construction, question-answering systems, and automated analysis of electronic medical records. Medical NER aims to automatically identify medical entities within text. These entities include, but are not limited to, body (bod), disease (dis), clinical symptom (sym), medical procedure (pro), medical equipment (equ), drug (dru), and medical examination item (ite).\n\nThese entities often exhibit complex characteristics, such as lengthy spans, nested structures, and polysemy, posing significant challenges for medical NER. For example, as shown in Figure 1, the three \"bod\" entities \"\u8ff7\u8d70\u795e\u7ecf\" (vagus nerve), \"\u820c\u54bd\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\" (glossopharyngeal nucleus), and \"\u820c\u4e0b\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\" (hypoglossal nucleus) are nested within the \"sym\" entity \"\u8ff7\u8d70\u795e\u7ecf\u3001\u820c\u54bd\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u53ca\u820c\u4e0b\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u53d7\u635f \u4f24\" (injury of vagus nerve, glossopharyngeal nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus).\n\nTo address the challenge of nested NER, we adopt a machine reading comprehension (MRC) approach, similar to the strategies employed by Li et al. (2020b) and Du et al. (2022).  Following Li et al. (2022), we leverage a joint prediction method that combines the strengths of Biaffine and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) predictors. Furthermore, we introduce a task-adaptive pre-training strategy to fine-tune the pre-trained model specifically for the medical domain. Our model incorporates several performance-enhancing techniques, including Conditional Layer Normalization (CLN), weighted layer fusion, word-pair embeddings, and multi-granularity dilated convolution.\n\nIn summary, this paper makes the following contributions:\n\n* We propose a novel nested medical NER model based on MRC, integrating Biaffine and MLP for joint prediction.",
        "The objective of this paper is to propose and analyze new risk-averse reinforcement learning methods for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our goal is to combine the efficacy of the methods of temporal differences with the robustness of dynamic risk measures, and to provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of the methods.\n\nMDPs are well-known models of stochastic sequential decision problems, covered in multiple monographs, and having countless applications. In the classical setting, the goal of an MDP is to find a policy minimizing the expected cost over a finite or infinite horizon. Traditional MDP models, although effective for small to medium size problems, suffer from the curse of dimensionality in problems with large state space. Approximate dynamic programming approaches try to tackle the curse of dimensionality and provide an approximate solution of an MDP. Such methods usually involve value function approximations, where the value of a state of the Markov process is approximated by a simple, usually linear, function of some selected features of the state.\n\nReinforcement learning methods involve simulation or observation of a Markov process to approximate the value function and learn the corresponding policies. The first studies attempted to emulate neural networks and biological learning processes, learning by trial and error. One of the core approaches in reinforcement learning is the method of temporal differences (TD(\u03bb)), known as TD(\u03bb). It uses differences between the values of the approximate value function at successive states to improve the approximation, concurrently with the evolution of the system. TD(\u03bb) is a continuum of algorithms depending on a parameter \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] which is used to exponentially weight past observations. The methods of temporal differences have been proven to converge in the mean.\n\nWe introduce risk models into temporal difference learning, rooted in the theory of dynamic measures of risk, which has been intensively developed in the last 15 years. In our previous work, we introduced the class of Markov dynamic risk measures, specially tailored for the MDPs, allowing for the development of dynamic programming equations and corresponding solution methods. Our ideas were successfully extended to undiscounted problems, partially observable and history-dependent systems, and further generalized.\n\nA number of works introduce models of risk into reinforcement learning, with few later studies proposing heuristic approaches involving coherent risk measures and their mean-risk counterparts. In this paper, we use Markov risk measures in conjunction with linear approximations of the value function.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 A projected risk-averse dynamic programming equation and analysis of its properties\n\u2022 A risk-averse method of temporal differences and proof of its convergence\n\u2022 A multistep risk-averse method of temporal differences and its convergence proof\n\u2022 An empirical study comparing the efficacy of the methods.",

        "Corporations today collect their customers' private information to train Machine Learning models that power a variety of services like recommendations, searches, targeted ads, etc. To prevent any unintended use of personal data, privacy policies, such as the General Data Protection Regulation [14] (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act [6] (CCPA), require that these corporations provide the \"Right to be Forgotten\" (RTBF) to their usersif a user wishes to revoke access to their data, an organization must comply by erasing all information about her without undue delay (typically a month). Critically, models trained in standard ways are susceptible to model inversion [13] and membership inference attacks [31], demonstrating that training data can be exfiltrated from these models.\n\nPeriodic retraining of models after excluding deleted users can be computationally expensive. Consequently, there is a growing interest in designing computationally cheap Machine Unlearning algorithms as an alternative to retraining for erasing the influence of deleted data from trained models. Since it is generally difficult to tell how a specific data point affects a model, Ginart et al. [15] propose quantifying the worst-case information leakage from an unlearned model through an unlearning guarantee on the mechanism, defined as a differential privacy (DP) like (\u03b5, \u03b4)-indistinguishability between its output and that of retraining on the updated database. With some minor variations in this definition, several mechanisms have been proposed and certified as unlearning algorithms in literature [15, 20, 30, 24, 17, 32].\n\nThis paper proposes a sound definition of data-deletion that does not suffer from the aforementioned shortcomings. Under our paradigm, a data-deletion mechanism is reliable if A) it is stateless, i.e., does not rely on any secret states that may be influenced by previously deleted records; and B) it generates models that are indistinguishable from some deleted record independent random variable. Statelessness thwarts the danger of sustained information leakage through internal data structures after deletion. Moreover, by measuring its deletion privacy via indistinguishability with any deleted-record independent random variable, as opposed to the output of retraining, we ensure reliability in the presence of adaptive requests that can create dependence between current and deleted records in the database.\n\nIn general, we show that under adaptive requests, any data-deletion mechanism must be privacy-preserving with respect to existing records to ensure the privacy of deleted records. Privacy with respect to existing records is necessary to prevent adaptive requests from creating any unwanted correlations among present and absent database entries that prevent deletion of records in an information theoretic sense. We also prove that if a mechanism is differentially private with respect to the existing records and satisfies our data-deletion guarantee under non-adaptive edit requests, then it also satisfies a data-deletion guarantee under adaptive requests. That is, we prove a general reduction for our sound data-deletion guarantee under non-adaptive requests to adaptive requests when the unlearning mechanism is differentially private with respect to records not being deleted. We emphasize that we are not advocating for doing data deletion through differentially-private mechanisms simply because it caps the information content of all records equally, deleted or otherwise. Instead, a data-deletion mechanism should provide two differing information reattainment bounds; one for records currently in the database in the form of a differential privacy guarantee, and the other for records previously deleted in the form of a non-adaptive data-deletion guarantee, as these two information bounds together ensure deletion privacy under adaptive requests as well.\n\nHowever, is indistinguishability to retraining a sufficient guarantee of deletion privacy? We argue that it is not. In the real world, a user's decision to remove his information is often affected by what a deployed model reveals about him. Unfortunately, the same revealed information may also affect other users' decisions. Such adaptive requests make the records in a database interdependent. For instance, if an individual is identified to be part of the training set, many members of his group may request deletion. Therefore, the representation of different groups in the unlearned model can reveal the individual's affiliation, even when he is no longer part of the dataset. We demonstrate on mechanism certified under existing unlearning guarantees, including Gupta et al. [18]'s adaptive unlearning, that the identity of the target record can be inferred from the unlearned model when requests are adaptive. Since it is possible that adaptive deletion requests can encode patterns specific to a target record in the curator's database, we argue that any deletion privacy certification via indistinguishability to retraining, as done in all prior unlearning definitions, is fundamentally flawed.\n\nIs an unlearning guarantee a sound and complete measure of deletion privacy when requests are non-adaptive? Again, we argue that it is neither. A sound deletion privacy guarantee must ensure the non-recovery of deleted records from an infinite number of model releases after deletion. However, approximate indistinguishability to retraining implies an inability to accurately recover deleted data from a singular unlearned model only, which we argue is not sufficient. We show that certain algorithms can satisfy an unlearning guarantee yet blatantly reveal the deleted data eventually over multiple releases. The vulnerability arises in algorithms that maintain partial computations in internal data-dependent states for speeding up subsequent deletions. These internal states can retain information even after record deletion and influence multiple future releases, making the myopic unlearning guarantee unreliable in sequential deletion settings. Several proposed unlearning algorithms in literature [24, 18] are stateful (rely on internal states) and, therefore, cannot be trusted. Secondly, existing unlearning definitions are incomplete notions of deletion privacy they exclude valid deletion mechanisms that do not imitate retraining. For instance, a (useless) mechanism that outputs a fixed untrained model on any request is a valid deletion algorithm. However, since its output is easily distinguishable from retraining, it fails to satisfy these unlearning guarantees.\n\nBased on our findings, we redefine the problem of data-deletion as designing a mechanism that (1.) satisfies a data-deletion guarantee against non-adaptive deletion requests, (2.) is differentially private for remaining records, and (3.) has the same utility guarantee as retraining under identical differential privacy constraints. On top of these objectives, a data-deletion mechanism must also be computationally cheaper than retraining for being useful. We propose a data-deletion solution based on Noisy Gradient Descent (Noisy-GD), a popular differentially private learning algorithm [3, 1], and show that our solution satisfies all the three objectives while providing substantial computational savings for both convex and non-convex losses. Our solution demonstrates a powerful synergy between data deletion and differential privacy as the same noise needed for the privacy of records present in the database also rapidly erases information regarding records deleted from the database. For convex and smooth losses, we certify that under a (q, \u03b5 dd)-R\u00e9nyi data-deletion and (q, \u03b5 dp)-R\u00e9nyi DP constraint, our Noisy-GD based deletion mechanism for d-dimensional models over n-sized databases with requests that modify no more than r records can maintain a tight optimal excess empirical risk of the order O qd \u03b5 dp n 2 while being \u2126(n log(min{ n r, n \u03b5 dd qd}) cheaper than retraining in gradient complexity.",
        "Text embeddings are an important tool for a variety of NLP tasks. They provide a general and compute-efficient solution to problems like topic classification, document clustering, text mining, and information retrieval, among others. Most modern techniques for learning text embeddings rely on minimizing a contrastive loss. This involves identifying, for each example x in the training set, a positive example x+ and a set of negative examples x-i associated with x. The choice of x+ and x-i is a key factor that distinguishes these techniques.\n\nUnsupervised methods rely on in-batch negatives for x-i and data augmentation for x+. Supervised or weakly supervised methods, on the other hand, rely on mining heuristics or annotated datasets to build the positive and negative pairs. For example, a common choice is to use entailment and contradiction pairs, respectively, as in datasets like SNLI and MNLI.\n\nIn this work, the problem of learning text embeddings is approached from the perspective of the objective function used. Two self-supervised representation learning algorithms, Barlow Twins (BT) and VI-CReg, are considered, which are introduced in the computer vision literature. These methods are classified as dimension contrastive, which, unlike the sample contrastive, de-correlate the embeddings across their dimensions, regulating the objective function. Both sample and dimension contrastive methods rely on data augmentation, which is more straightforward for image data, while being considered trickier for textual data.\n\nThe main goal of this paper is to compare the embeddings learned through sample-contrastive and dimension-contrastive techniques, and explore different augmentation strategies, using Sim-CSE, Barlow Twins, and VICReg, for the comparison.",
        "To enhance the logical flow and coherence of the text, I've restructured the paragraphs to present the information in a more organized manner. Here's the revised version:\n\n---\n\nMyocardial strain has demonstrated its significance in identifying left myocardial activation (LMA) regions for an optimized pacing site for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) [1, 2]. The quantification of myocardial strains can be achieved through various specialized imaging techniques that offer information on ventricular deformation patterns and cardiac motion abnormalities from MR images. Commonly used methods include MR tagging [3], cine SSFP with feature tracking (FT) [4, 5, 6, 7], and cine DENSE [8], with DENSE standing out for its high accuracy in capturing myocardial deformations [9]. Despite the advantages of DENSE, its widespread clinical use is hindered by limited accessibility, primarily due to the high-cost facilities and specialized expertise required for image collection and analysis. Many clinical centers often opt for cine FT. However, the accuracy of FT is compromised by inherent limitations in image quality, including low spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, these registration-based tracking algorithms focus solely on motions along contours [10].\n\nRecent research has explored the application of deep learning to enhance the accuracy of predicting myocardial motion from cine images, guided by the supervision of DENSE [11]. In this study, the authors employed a neural network to capture the intricate relationship between a time sequence of left ventricular (LV) myocardium segmented from DENSE and the corresponding encoded displacement fields. By assuming a minimal domain gap between cine and DENSE segmentations in predicting displacement fields, the researchers directly evaluated the trained model on cine input.\n\nInspired by [11], this paper introduces a multimodal deep learning method that, for the first time, leverages DENSE to guide the analysis of cine CMRs for improved LMA detection. Using DENSE strain as ground truth data, we develop an end-to-end joint learning framework that predicts LMA regions (measured by the onset of circumferential shortening (TOS) of segmental myocardial regions [12]) from cine images.",
        "### 1.1 Problem Overview\n\nModel uncertainty is a crucial aspect of mathematical modeling, particularly in mathematical finance and economics, where models cannot rely on well-established physical laws. Traditionally, these models were developed in three steps: \n\n1. Gathering statistical properties of the underlying time-series, known as stylized facts.\n2. Crafting a parsimonious model that captures the desired market characteristics without unnecessary complexity.\n3. Calibrating and validating the handcrafted model.\n\nModel complexity was generally undesirable because it increased the computational effort required for calibration, pricing, and using tools from martingale optimal transport, which also provide super- and sub-hedging strategies [Beiglb\u00f6ck et al., 2013]. Without further constraints, the class of all calibrated models, denoted as M, might be too large, making the corresponding bounds too wide for practical use [Eckstein et al., 2019]. Efforts to incorporate additional market information to tighten the pricing interval have been made [Nadtochiy and Obloj, 2017; Aksamit et al., 2020]. Another challenge with the entire class of calibrated models M is the difficulty in obtaining a practical or explicit model from the measures that yield price bounds. Such explicit models are useful for consistent calibration under both the pricing measure Q and the real-world measure P, necessary for risk estimation and stress testing [Broadie et al., 2011; Pelsser and Schweizer, 2016], or for learning hedging strategies in the presence of transaction costs and illiquidity constraints [Buehler et al., 2019].\n\n### 1.2 Neural SDEs\n\nConsider a fixed time horizon \\( T > 0 \\) and, for simplicity, assume a constant interest rate \\( r \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).

        "Network softwarization has revolutionized service deployment and management, offering unprecedented flexibility and reconfigurability.  Replacing hardware-based network functions with virtual network functions (VNFs) eliminates hardware constraints, and cloud computing with software-based networks allows service providers to optimize resource utilization in data centers [1].\n\nHowever, the increasing number of network devices and interconnections [2], coupled with the proliferation of services through virtual networks, has led to greater complexity and scale.  This expansion presents significant management challenges, potentially degrading service quality and consistency [1], [2].\n\nRecognizing the need for reliable service delivery, providers are turning to data-driven approaches for virtual network management.  These approaches leverage big data and machine learning (ML) to effectively manage large-scale networks with intricate dependencies.  Anomaly detection, a crucial network management technique, aims to maintain service quality by rapidly identifying and addressing abnormal system behavior [3], [4], [5].\n\nExisting ML-based anomaly detection methods for VNFs often rely on data collected from the operating system (OS) or hypervisor of virtual machines (VMs) [1], [6], [7]. For instance, [1] collected a dataset and applied techniques like decision tree-based gradient boosting machine (GBM), XGBoost, and deep neural networks (DNNs) to differentiate anomalous instances from normal ones.\n\nHowever, these methods often overlook valuable sequential information inherent in the VNF sequence\u2014a critical factor given that network traffic traverses VNF instances arranged in a specific order [8].  Moreover, if services require different service function chain (SFC) compositions (varying in VNF type, order, and number), existing approaches often necessitate training separate models, particularly when the number of VNF instances differs due to input dimension discrepancies.  Furthermore, they often fail to leverage temporal information within time-series monitoring data, which could be crucial when anomalies exhibit temporal patterns, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nTo capture sequential information within the VNF sequence, we employ unidirectional and bidirectional recurrent neural networks (Uni- and Bi-RNNs) and Transformers.  These sequential architectures accommodate variable-length input sequences, making our models compatible with data from SFCs with varying numbers of VNFs.  This compatibility enables joint training across datasets from different SFCs.  Additionally, to capture temporal information, we utilize RNNs, which process monitoring data at a given time step alongside a series of inputs from previous time steps.\n\nTo further enhance the utilization of temporal information, we incorporate an additional component that leverages the prediction from the preceding time step.",
        "Despite the significant success of deep learning across various fields, its widespread adoption is still hindered by a lack of transparency. It is generally challenging to explain the decision-making process of a deep neural model, particularly to the end-user. One promising solution is the generation of natural language explanations (NLEs), which offer an intuitively understandable rationale for a neural network's decisions. With the increasing need to integrate multi-modal information, such as vision and language, recent research has focused on generating natural language explanations for vision-language tasks (VL-NLE).\n\nHowever, existing VL-NLE models face several issues. First, many models use separate modules for answer prediction and NLE generation (e.g., FME, e-UG), resulting in suboptimal NLE performance due to the loose integration between these modules. Second, their backbone models are often pretrained on a limited set of tasks (e.g., VL-T5), failing to fully leverage the potential of multi-task learning with a unified architecture. Third, they often rely on ad hoc solutions, incorporating additional task-specific modules or resources to boost performance on specific datasets (e.g., NLX-GPT, RExC), which limits their applicability as comprehensive models\u2014a current goal in AI research.\n\nTo address these issues, we propose leveraging recent advances in large-scale multi-task pre-training of generative vision-language models for VL-NLE tasks. We hypothesize that training on a wide range of diverse tasks enables the acquisition of commonsense knowledge and reasoning skills necessary for generating complex and accurate NLEs. We fine-tune the recently introduced OFA model, a generative Transformer pretrained on a diverse set of multimodal and uni-modal tasks, for each target NLE task. Our results demonstrate that a single unified architecture, not specifically pretrained to generate explanations and without any task-specific modifications, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the e-SNLI-VE and VQA-X datasets. The generated explanations received higher average ratings from human annotators than the ground-truth explanations on e-SNLI-VE and were preferred in direct A-B comparisons on both e-SNLI-VE and VQA-X. On the challenging VCR dataset, our approach outperforms other baselines according to our user study. Given that our approach's explanation ratings surpass those of the ground-truth annotations on two of the three tasks (e-SNLI-VE and VQA-X), we advocate for the development of new challenging VL-NLE tasks and improved dataset quality. As an immediate solution, we propose e-ViL-combined as a new challenge, requiring a single model to solve and explain multiple different VL-NLE tasks from the three datasets.",
        "The demand for large deep learning (DL) models has surged in recent years, thanks to their dominating accuracy across a range of tasks in natural language processing (NLP) [3, 5, 10, 12] and computer vision [13, 33, 65]. These models are typically developed in user-friendly DL frameworks like PyTorch [41], which feature dynamic model graphs. However, these frameworks lack sufficient optimization for high-performance execution, a critical issue as models grow exponentially in size and training time increases accordingly.\n\nTo address the growing model training time, developers have proposed various optimizations. Manual optimization is one approach, implemented at different layers of model training. This includes inserting high-performance kernels [11, 28, 40, 54] for computationally intensive operators on specific devices (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs), employing data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism [37, 49, 54], and using activation checkpointing [8, 21, 25] to efficiently distribute training across multiple devices. However, manual optimization introduces challenges. Challenge 1: Generality - Incorporating these optimizations requires intrusive changes to the model implementation, which restricts generalization to other models. Even minor model changes may necessitate new optimizations. Moreover, optimized models become platform-specific, obliging developers to maintain multiple implementations for different platforms and devices. Challenge 2: Ease of Tuning - Optimization schemes have numerous configurations to tune (e.g., pipeline stages, number of activation checkpoints) to achieve optimal performance. This tuning process is tedious and error-prone, especially when tied closely to optimizations.\n\nAnother set of optimization approaches involves converting DL models into static graphs and using DL compilers for automatic optimizations. For example, JAX [4] uses the XLA compiler [18] to trace the entire model into a static graph, enabling aggressive optimizations such as operator fusion, expression simplification, and 3D parallelism [70]. Similarly, PyTorch 2.0 [42] introduces a compiler interface to trace dynamic graph executions and construct static graphs in torch.fx [51]. While automatic optimization requires minimal engineering effort and addresses challenges in manual optimization, it introduces new challenges. Challenge 3: Programmability - Static model graphs require that everything be statically analyzable and deterministic, which may impose constraints on users. For instance, JAX requires pure Python functions without in-place updates [4]. PyTorch 2.0 cannot trace through essential collective operators like all_reduce for distributed training [42]. Developers may find it difficult to control optimizations in fine granularity, such as disabling certain rules or excluding operators from a compiler pass. Challenge 4: Debuggability - Developers typically use layer modules as building blocks to maintain model understanding, but DL compilers flatten these into single-level dataflow graphs, obscuring the original model and complicating troubleshooting.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose Slapo, a Schedule LAnguage for Progressive Optimization, designed for DL frameworks with dynamic model graphs. Slapo features several major innovations:\n\n1. **Decoupling Model Execution from Definition**: Slapo separates model execution (\"schedule\") from definition, allowing developers to maintain the same model implementation while enabling performance engineers to optimize model- or platform-specific schedules independently. This concept draws inspiration from domain-specific compilers like Halide [48] and Apache TVM [7], which decouple tensor operator scheduling from arithmetic definition.\n\n2. **Auto-tuning**: Slapo provides a programming interface for specifying tuneable knobs, creating a tuning space that Slapo's auto-tuner can explore for optimal configuration, addressing Challenge 2. This enables auto-scheduling as seen in Ansor [69], a feature planned for future work.\n\n3. **Progressive Optimization**: Slapo employs a \"trace by need\" approach, tracing desired modules into static graphs for compiler-based optimizations. This allows developers to control the tracing process through scheduling primitives, addressing Challenge 3.",
        "The advancement of digital imaging technology, from early monochrome photography to modern 8K resolution, plays a pivotal role in various fields, including medical diagnostics, where image clarity is essential. In medical imaging, high-resolution techniques are particularly crucial for diagnostics and surgical procedures, emphasizing the importance of super-resolution (SR) techniques to overcome challenges like lens limitations.\n\nIn stereo image SR, maintaining view consistency is vital. Recent developments, such as the Parallax Attention Module in Disparity Constraint Stereo SR (DCSSR) and the Bidirectional Parallax Attention Map (biPAM) in iPASSR, have enhanced perceptual quality. Accurately identifying and segmenting surgical instruments in images is important, and advanced semantic segmentation techniques, such as leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and architectures like U-Net, are employed to improve accuracy.\n\nOur research integrates SR and segmentation technologies for robotic-assisted surgeries. We introduce a hybrid model that applies SR before segmentation, enhancing accuracy with high-quality inputs. This model, benchmarked against established methods like U-Net and TernausNet, demonstrates superior performance in both SR and segmentation, proving its efficacy in complex medical imaging tasks.",
        "Business processes form the backbone of numerous enterprise operations, including loan origination, invoice management, and insurance claims processing (Van Der Aalst et al., 2011). The business process management (BPM) industry is projected to reach nearly $16 billion by 2023 (Marketwatch, 2019). This presents a significant opportunity to integrate AI to reduce costs or enhance customer experiences (Rao and Verweij, 2017). The BPM literature is abundant with machine learning solutions designed to gain insights into clusters of process traces (Nguyen et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2019), predict outcomes (Breuker et al., 2016), and recommend decisions (Mannhardt et al., 2016). Deep learning models, including those from the NLP domain, have also been applied (Tax et al., 2017; Evermann, Rehse, and Fettke, 2017).\n\nUnfortunately, few of these innovations have been implemented and adopted by enterprise companies (Daugherty and Wilson, 2018). Those that have been adopted are confined to narrow domains such as customer services, enterprise risk, and compliance (Wilson, Alter, and Shukla, 2016).\n\nWe assert that a significant reason for the limited adoption of AI models in BPM is that business users are risk-averse and do not inherently trust AI models. There has been insufficient focus on explaining model predictions to business users within the context of their processes. These users are typically experts in their fields but not data scientists, so explanations must be presented in their business domain vocabulary. We challenge the BPM community to build on the AI interpretability literature and the AI Trust community to leverage business process artifacts.",
        "Person re-identification is a prevalent computer vision task in which the objective is to locate a person, depicted in a query image, from a vast collection of gallery images. Over the past two years, the concept of generalizable person re-identification has garnered increasing attention due to its significance in both research and practical applications. This task delves into examining the adaptability of a learned person re-identification model in unfamiliar settings and utilizes direct cross-dataset evaluation for performance assessment.\n\nIn the realm of deep metric learning, in addition to feature representation learning and loss designs, explicit deep feature matching schemes have proven to be effective for matching person images. These schemes offer advantages in handling pose and viewpoint changes, occlusions, and misalignments. Notably, a recent technique known as query-adaptive convolution (QAConv) has demonstrated the efficacy of explicit convolutional matching between gallery and query feature maps for generalizable person re-identification. However, these methods typically entail higher computational costs compared to traditional feature learning approaches.\n\nApart from introducing novel generalizable algorithms, another approach to enhancing generalization is by augmenting the scale and diversity of the training data. For instance, recent datasets like RandPerson synthesized 8,000 identities, while other studies collected up to 30,000 persons for re-identification training. These studies have observed improved generalization capabilities for person re-identification. Nonetheless, the efficiency of deep metric learning from large-scale data remains an understudied aspect in the context of person re-identification.\n\nVarious methods exist for learning deep person re-identification models, including classification (utilizing the ID loss), metric learning (employing pairwise or triplet loss), and their combinations (e.g., ID + triplet loss). While using an ID loss is convenient for classification learning, it leads to significant memory and computational costs in large-scale deep learning. Similarly, involving class signatures for metric learning on a global scale may not be efficient. For instance, the approach in QAConv is challenging to scale up for large-scale training due to the design of a class memory module that stores full feature maps for all classes as signatures, necessitating cross feature map convolutional matching during training.\n\nTherefore, the involvement of class parameters or signatures in either classification or metric learning is deemed inefficient for large-scale person re-identification training. In contrast, pairwise deep metric learning between samples in mini-batches is considered more suitable for this task. The selection of an appropriate batch sampler is crucial for efficient learning, with the PK sampler being a popular random sampling method in person re-identification. However, to enhance learning efficiency, an online hard example mining method has been proposed, though it is constrained by the fully random PK sampler.\n\nTo address this limitation, a proposal is made to incorporate hard example mining at the data sampling stage through an efficient mini-batch sampling method called graph sampling (GS) for large-scale deep metric learning.",
        "Computer fonts are widely used in our daily lives. The legibility and aesthetic of fonts adopted in books, posters, advertisements, etc., are critical for their producers during the designing procedures. Thereby, the demands for high-quality fonts in various styles have increased rapidly. However, font design is a creative and time-consuming task, especially for font libraries consisting of large amounts of characters (e.g., Chinese).\n\nFor example, the official character set GB18030-2000 consists of 27533 Chinese characters, most of which have complicated structures and contain dozens of strokes. Designing or writing out such large amounts of complex glyphs in a consistent style is time-consuming and costly. Thus, more and more researchers and companies are interested in developing systems that can automatically generate high-quality Chinese fonts from a few input samples.\n\nWith the help of various neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs and RNNs), researchers have proposed many DL-based methods for Chinese font synthesis. DL-based methods aim to model the relationship between input and output data (outlines, glyph images, or writing trajectories). Most of them are CNN-based models, such as zi2zi, EMD, and SCFont. Intuitively, we can represent a glyph as the combination of a writing trajectory and a stroke rendering style. Thus, there are some RNN-based methods (e.g., FontRNN) synthesizing the writing trajectory for each Chinese character.\n\nDespite the great progress made in the last few years, most existing approaches still need large amounts of offline or online glyph images to train the font synthesis models. Moreover, the quality of vector outlines/glyph images synthesized by those methods is often unsatisfactory, especially when the desired font is in a cursive style or the number of input samples is too small.\n\nThe design of our FontTransformer is motivated by the observation that a Chinese character is typically rendered as a glyph image when it is composed of sequential strokes in essence.",
        "In neutral atom quantum computers, extracting information from the system typically involves fluorescence imaging [1]. An electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera captures an image of the array of atoms. A reconstruction algorithm then analyzes this image to detect the occupancy of each potential atom site. An example of such an image can be seen in Fig. 1a. However, since no ground truth exists for images taken on real systems, the state of the system can only be inferred by trusting the reconstruction algorithm.\n\nWhen imaging the experiment, Poissonian-distributed photoelectrons from atomic fluorescence compete with stochastically distributed electrons from various origins of camera noise. In a performance-tuned quantum computer, the qubit readout time is minimized, allowing only a few fluorescence photons per atom to be collected. This competition between photoelectrons and noise electrons diminishes confidence in determining whether a site contains an atom, thus affecting the final image analysis.\n\nThis problem is exacerbated by potential atom loss during the imaging process if not perfectly tuned. Sites of lost atoms resemble normal occupied sites but have varying effective exposure times, leading to a continuous transition between the brightness of unoccupied and occupied sites. Ultimately, the key metric is whether a site is occupied after imaging, a binary decision. While this can be improved by taking consecutive images, they still lack certainty. Sites that are inherently dimmer or appear dimmer by chance might be excluded from testing on real data despite being significant, as assumptions about their occupancy are probabilistic.\n\nOptimized detection algorithms are necessary to enhance detection fidelity under these challenging conditions. However, designing and training these algorithms require labeled data with absolute knowledge of atomic presence or absence, which is unattainable from real-world experiments. To address this, we propose generating artificial images with realistic properties directly from the corresponding ground truth. Starting from a given array of atom locations and states, our approach constructs a picture simulating the imaging process. Since image formation, considering influences from both photoelectrons and noise electrons, is well understood, we can produce atomic fluorescence pictures nearly indistinguishable from real ones. Additionally, the simulated pictures can be generated faster than real ones, facilitating rapid development and training. Fig. 1b shows such a simulated image.\n\nSince the simulation output is based on the absolute truth of occupancy, it can be used to benchmark detection algorithms accurately by comparing the reconstructed state to the original one. However, it is crucial to trust the simulator's capability to produce accurate images. All noise sources and probability distributions must be modeled and sampled accurately to evaluate an algorithm's performance using the generator's data.\n\nAfter implementing the simulation, we demonstrate the differences and similarities between its output and actual images. Accurate modeling processes include:\n1) The probability distribution of filling the array with atoms and the likelihood and timing of atom loss during imaging.\n2) The properties of the optical system, including any imperfections or aberrations a physical camera may encounter.\n3) The internal workings of different cameras, from the physical pixel to the digital output.\n\nThe real data informing our approach and evaluations originate from experiments at the Strontium Rydberg Lab at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics (MPQ). Section II provides a brief explanation of a nearly equivalent setup. It is important to note that some data comes from the early stages of the overarching project or was acquired through intentional parameter choices, which may cause images to appear subpar compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",
        "With the recent exponential increase in large-scale cloud-based services, we are witnessing a paradigm shift in the nature of these systems and how they handle job tasks. An illustrative example is the presence of devices with varying capabilities spanning different generations of technology within a cluster. For instance, it's not uncommon to find a \u223c4 TFLOP K80, a \u223c30 TFLOP L4, and a \u223c100 TFLOP TPUv3 in the same facility (Google, 2023b,a). Similarly, disparities in server speeds can arise due to the fractional allocation of resources in serverless computing setups (Amazon, 2023). Another scenario involves ML inference deployments where servers host models of varying sizes, resulting in differing service times (Shazeer et al., 2017).\n\nMotivated by such heterogeneous systems, this work addresses the challenge of efficiently routing jobs in queueing systems with servers of varying speeds. We introduce a model with a single central queue and a set of heterogeneous servers, as depicted in Figure 1. Beyond the cloud computing context that inspired our study, this model and the routing policies proposed herein are also applicable in other domains such as packet routing in communication networks (Srikant and Ying, 2013) and resource management in healthcare, manufacturing, or ride-sharing operations (Walton and Xu, 2021; Tsitsiklis and Xu, 2017).\n\nTraditional queueing methods are typically tailored for homogeneous systems and may not accommodate the heterogeneity in service rates (Harchol-Balter, 2013). While these policies might work well under specific load conditions or types of heterogeneity, they are not optimal for general scenarios. For example, a work-conserving routing policy that aims to keep all servers occupied when there are jobs in the system is latency-optimal for homogeneous systems but suboptimal for heterogeneous systems. In the latter case, it can be advantageous to keep slower servers idle and retain jobs in the central queue until the queue length surpasses a certain threshold or one of the faster servers becomes available.\n\nResearch has shown that for a scenario involving two servers \u2013 one fast and one slow \u2013 a threshold policy is optimal (Lin and Kumar, 1984; Koole, 1995; Walrand, 1984). However, extending the optimality proof of the threshold policy to a general multi-server setting has remained an open challenge for almost four decades (Koole, 2022). Additionally, determining the threshold as a function of service rates and job arrival rate is intricate and unknown.\n\nIn this work, in response to the complexity of devising a closed-form expression for the policy, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to determine the best routing policy in multi-server heterogeneous queueing systems. We offer the following key contributions to overcome the inefficiencies of conventional RL methods due to a high-dimensional state space: (a) We utilize the queueing structure to formulate a low-dimensional soft threshold policy and introduce ACHQ, an efficient policy gradient-based algorithm. (b) We provide guarantees for stationary points and, in the case of two servers, demonstrate convergence to an approximate global optimum. (c) We showcase an enhancement in the expected response time by up to \u223c30% compared to a greedy policy that routes to the quickest available server.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to propose an RL solution to this issue and one of the few recent papers leveraging queueing structure to devise an effective RL methodology with provable assurances.",
        "As mathematical models of biological systems continue to advance, they are increasingly utilized in designing systems for specific purposes. A prime illustration of this is the development of custom networks of interacting biomolecules that function as logic gates (e.g., AND or OR) in response to varying input concentrations. These networks have a wide range of applications such as biosensors, targeted drug delivery, and tunable genetic circuits. However, due to discrepancies between mathematical predictions and biological actuality, each network must undergo experimental validation to ensure that it exhibits the desired response in the real world. The costs of these validation experiments can escalate significantly when dealing with numerous networks. In our study, we introduce a method to ascertain if the actual response of a network closely aligns with the desired outcome.\n\nPrevious validation of biomolecular networks [1, 4, 5] involved conducting experiments at specific predetermined input points deemed crucial for the intended application. The selection of these points aimed to ensure similarity between the experimental outcomes. A related yet distinct issue is explored in the realm of surrogate modeling literature, where understanding the disparity between experimental data and a true reference is paramount [6, 7, 8, 9]. Drawing inspiration from these methods, we (1) model the disparity so that observed data guides our prediction of the overall discrepancy and (2) use this model to intelligently determine the next experiment to conduct. In our approach, after each data acquisition, a Gaussian process is fitted to the disparity between the experimental results and the computer model.",
        "Harvesting energy from ocean waves has gained prominence since the oil crisis of 1973. Ocean energy holds significant potential, particularly for coastal communities, which has attracted the attention of governments, industries, and engineers, resulting in over 1,000 patents worldwide [1, 2]. Wave energy boasts immense reserves, high power potential, greater power density than solar and wind energy, geographic diversity, and minimal environmental interference [3, 4].\n\nA crucial component of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) is the power take-off (PTO) system, which converts the mechanical energy absorbed by the device into electrical energy [5, 3]. Due to the fluctuating nature of wave energy, conventional PTOs are not very effective at harnessing wave power [i31]. The development of hydraulic PTO (HPTO) systems has been a significant breakthrough in ocean energy applications, thanks to their fast-frequency response, ease of control, high efficiency, hydraulic overload protection, and adaptability to high power and low frequency [5, 3, 6]. These features make HPTOs the preferred PTO type for point absorber wave energy devices, achieving up to 90% efficiency [6]. Although there has been an increase in studies on HPTO applications in various WECs [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], the number of studies is still fewer than those on WECs with Linear PTOs, leaving many unexplored areas for future research. Most studies have focused on the performance and efficiency of HPTO systems without considering the impact of HPTO model parameters, which are crucial for unit efficiency and power output. Only a few studies have addressed this issue, particularly the simultaneous change in HPTO parameters, as seen in [12, 6].\n\nThis paper investigates the effect of HPTO parameters\u2014namely piston area, volume, and pre-charged pressure of the low-pressure gas accumulator (LPA), and the volume of the high-pressure gas accumulator (HPA)\u2014on the power output of the WEC.",
        "High-capacity neural networks trained on large, diverse datasets have led to remarkable models capable of solving numerous tasks, rapidly adapting to new ones, and producing general-purpose representations in NLP and vision (Brown et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). The promise of offline reinforcement learning (RL) lies in leveraging these advances to produce policies with broad generalization, emergent capabilities, and performance that exceeds the capabilities demonstrated in the training dataset.\n\nThus far, the only offline RL approaches that demonstrate broadly generalizing policies and transferable representations are heavily based on supervised learning (Reed et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). However, these approaches are likely to perform poorly when the dataset does not contain expert trajectories (Kumar et al., 2021b).\n\nOffline Q-learning has shown to perform well across dataset compositions in a variety of simulated (Gulcehre et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020) and real-world domains (Chebotar et al., 2021; Soares et al., 2021). However, these are largely centered around small-scale, single-task problems where broad generalization and learning general-purpose representations are not expected. Scaling these methods to high-capacity models on large, diverse datasets remains a critical challenge. Prior works have hinted at the difficulties: on small-scale, single-task deep RL benchmarks, scaling model capacity can lead to instabilities or degrade performance (Van Hasselt et al., 2018; Sinha et al., 2020; Ota et al., 2021), explaining why decade-old tiny 3-layer CNN architectures (Mnih et al., 2013) are still prevalent. Moreover, works that have scaled architectures to millions of parameters (Espeholt et al., 2018; Teh et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2019; Schrittwieser et al., 2021) typically focus on online learning and employ many sophisticated techniques to stabilize learning, such as supervised auxiliary losses, distillation, and pre-training. Thus, it is unclear whether offline Q-learning can be scaled to high-capacity models trained on a large, diverse dataset.\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that with careful design decisions, offline Q-learning can scale to high-capacity models trained on large, diverse datasets from many tasks. This leads to policies that not only generalize broadly but also learn representations that effectively transfer to new downstream tasks and exceed performance in the training dataset. Crucially, we make three modifications motivated by prior work in deep learning and offline RL. First, we find that a modified ResNet architecture (He et al., 2016) substantially outperforms typical deep RL architectures and follows a power-law relationship between model capacity and performance, unlike common alternatives. Second, a discretized representation of the return distribution with a distributional cross-entropy loss (Bellemare et al., 2017) substantially improves performance compared to standard Q-learning that utilizes mean squared error. Finally, feature normalization on the intermediate feature representations stabilizes training and prevents feature co-adaptation (Kumar et al., 2021a).\n\nTo systematically evaluate the impact of these changes on scaling and generalization, we train a single policy to play 40 Atari games (Bellemare et al., 2013; Agarwal et al., 2020), similarly to Lee et al. (2022), and evaluate performance when the training dataset contains expert trajectories and when the data is sub-optimal. This problem is especially challenging because of the diversity of games with their own unique dynamics, reward, visuals, and agent embodiments.",
        "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in critical applications such as facial recognition (Schroff, Kalenichenko, and Philbin 2015), medical diagnostics (Peng et al. 2021), and autonomous driving (Tian et al. 2018). However, despite these achievements, DNNs remain susceptible to adversarial examples (Szegedy et al. 2014; Biggio et al. 2013).  Existing methods for generating adversarial examples primarily focus on two approaches:  L<sub>p</sub>-norm restricted attacks (Goodfellow, Shlens, and Szegedy 2015; Kurakin, Goodfellow, and Bengio 2017; Madry et al. 2018; Carlini and Wagner 2017; Moosavi-Dezfooli, Fawzi, and Frossard 2016) and unrestricted attacks (Brown et al. 2017; Hosseini and Poovendran 2018; Bhattad et al. 2020; Song et al. 2018; Qiu et al. 2020; Yuan et al. 2022).\n\nL<sub>p</sub>-norm attacks constrain perturbations to the raw pixel-space within a bounded norm to maintain photorealism.  Unrestricted attacks, on the other hand, employ methods like geometric distortions (Guo et al. 2018), color/texture changes (Hosseini and Poovendran 2018; Bhattad et al. 2020; Yuan et al. 2022), and semantic alterations (Qiu et al. 2020; Song et al. 2018).  A key limitation of most existing methods is the assumption that an attacker can freely modify any feature. This assumption is unrealistic in real-world scenarios.  For example, accessing the digital input of an image recognition model might be intractable, making pixel-space perturbations infeasible.  Furthermore, simply altering alterable features while ignoring the induced changes on other features overlooks the inherent causal relationships between them \u2013 a crucial aspect underappreciated by existing methods.\n\nConsider a credit scoring model.  Altering an applicant's income without adjusting the debt-to-income ratio is unrealistic, as the latter is directly influenced by the former.  This highlights the need to consider the causal generating process when crafting adversarial examples for practical applications.\n\nThis work introduces CADE, a framework for generating Counterfactual ADversarial Examples that incorporates the causal generating process.  CADE addresses two fundamental questions: 1) *Where to attack*: identifying vulnerable variables through a causal lens; and 2) *How to attack*: leveraging the causal generating process to create realistic adversarial examples.\n\nTo determine *where to attack*, CADE analyzes the vulnerability of discriminative DNNs to interventional data, exploiting their inability to reason causally, unlike human perception. For instance, a DNN might misclassify a car in space as a satellite, relying on the background rather than the object's inherent features (Figure 1).  CADE addresses this by explicitly analyzing the effects of interventions, guiding both observable and latent attacks.\n\nTo determine *how to attack*, CADE utilizes the concept of counterfactuals \u2013 predicting the consequences of interventions on variables given an observation.  Figure 1 illustrates this: intervening on the background changes the image while preserving other characteristics (color, shape) represented by exogenous variables.  CADE leverages the counterfactual generation framework (Pearl 2009), incorporating the causal generating process.  Recent advancements in causal discovery (Zheng et al. 2018; Yu et al. 2019), generative modeling (Kingma and Welling 2014; Goodfellow et al. 2014; Ho, Jain, and Abbeel 2020), and causal representation learning (Kocaoglu et al.",
        "Deep learning has become a powerful tool for big data mining in Earth Observation (EO) [1]. However, supervised deep learning methods are notoriously data-hungry, requiring large amounts of high-quality labeled data to avoid overfitting. Despite the abundance of Remote Sensing (RS) images, obtaining accurately annotated labels poses a significant challenge due to the expensive, laborious, and time-consuming nature of the annotation process, which often involves domain experts and field surveys.\n\nNevertheless, there are many sources of labels from which we can easily obtain large amounts of labeled data with minimal efforts. For instance, Volunteered Geographic Information sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM) collect label information from individuals in a volunteer capacity and make it freely available [2]. Another approach is to design automatic labeling tools, such as AutoGeoLabel [3], to generate labels rapidly for RS images from high-quality data sources, e.g., LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. Additionally, various land use land cover products, including Google's Dynamic World [4], ESA's World Cover [5], and Esri's Land Cover [6], offer rich information for EO. However, these label sources often result in unreliable labels, such as noisy labels due to insufficient human annotation. For example, [7] documents human uncertainty in the classification of local climate zones. As reported in [8], deep learning models are known for their large number of parameters and capability of learning complex functions, yet vulnerability to label noise. This also applies to segmentation tasks [9]. Therefore, these readily available labels require special considerations when applied to real-world scenarios. Beyond model training, noisy labels may significantly affect the evaluation of methodologies as well [10].\n\nWhile learning from noisy labels (LNL) has been extensively studied for image classification tasks, few approaches have been developed for image segmentation tasks. Existing LNL methods for segmentation tasks mainly borrow ideas from LNL for classification and semi-supervised segmentation methods. In classification tasks, the entire image is treated as a single sample unit and can be considered to have approximately similar levels of uncertainty. Thus, random flipping can be used to simulate label noise for classification tasks. In contrast, the sample unit in segmentation tasks is a pixel, and neighboring pixels are interconnected through spatial dependencies [13]. As a result, pixels located near boundaries are more difficult to define. From this perspective, we can classify pixel-wise label noise into two categories: assignment noise and shape noise. Assignment noise occurs when objects are labeled incorrectly, while shape noise refers to inexact object delineation caused by phenomena such as coarse annotations. Inaccurate co-registration of image-mask pairs is another common source of label noise, mainly leading to shape noise with misaligned boundaries [14]. Generally, assignment noise incurs more severe damage on model training than shape noise does.\n\nAs regards the ideas borrowed from the semi-supervised learning domain, self-training methods are naturally related to the noisy label problem, where pseudo labels generated by the classifier itself inevitably incur some inaccurate assignments [17]. Following this paradigm, [18] - [20] correct possibly wrong labels in the training set by means of high-confidence or low-uncertainty predictions. To make these methods effective, the questions of when and how to correct the labels should be considered. In semi-supervised scenarios, only a small part of the accurately labeled patches is available at the beginning. The training set is gradually expanded via adding pseudo labels as training continues, during which the impact of bad pseudo labels can be offset to some extent by the advantages brought by training size expansion. LNL settings do not confer this advantage since the classifier originally has access to a large number of labels that are not as accurate as expected. Therefore, manually setting the warm-up length as in [19] can easily lead to an early or late start of correction, risking correction effectiveness degradation when model predictions are not reliable enough. Liu et al. [21] propose an adaptive method for label correction initialization in which the training accuracy curve is fit on an exponential function and the change in its gradients is monitored. While promising, this method has a sensitive threshold setting to noise rates, and the fluctuation of accuracy curves makes the detection results unstable. In terms of how to correct, current correction criteria usually take softmax/sigmoid outputs as confidence indicators [20]. The threshold is either predefined by users or flexibly adjusted in an image-wise fashion [19], more or less ignoring the spatial dependencies among pixels. One further possibility is to determine data and model uncertainty, e.g., via Bayesian Neural Networks, for sample selection [22]. Yet a major challenge is the lack of ground truth to evaluate the estimated data uncertainty when developing such methods to address real-world problems.\n\nIn this work, we study building footprint identification from aerial imagery to develop a novel methodology to handle, among other types of noise, incomplete label noise, in which a given set of building outlines is known to miss a subset of existing buildings (false negative), but annotated buildings are assumed to have accurate outlines.",

In the employment market, this has led to the proliferation of job-seeking websites such as Computrabajo, Bumeran, and Info Jobs, which host vast amounts of unstructured data containing valuable information about job candidates and their CVs, as well as job position profiles.\n\n## Text Mining and Natural Language Processing\nText Mining (TM) [3] employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract meaningful information from human-written text. This automation is essential given the enormous volume of textual data sources, including emails, documents, and social networks. NLP algorithms [4]-[6] are particularly crucial in processing and analyzing this textual content to extract relevant terms and information.\n\n## User Preferences and Recommendation Systems\nUsers typically have specific preferences [2] that are not explicitly stated but must be extracted from text. These preferences are commonly represented in matrix form, indicating the level of preference for specific items or products. Recommendation Systems (RS) leverage this information to suggest items (products, objects, etc.) to users based on data from other users, often utilizing NLP algorithms to process textual information.\n\n## Document Structure\nThis work presents a comprehensive approach to building a Job Recommendation System using Web Scraping, NLP, and TM algorithms.

        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Optimal Motion Planning for Industrial Robotics: Enhancing Reliability and Efficiency\n\n## Introduction\n\nIndustrial manufacturing has widely adopted robots for various tasks such as welding and product handling. These operations typically rely on manual teaching or programming. However, the push toward automatic production necessitates efficient and robust optimal motion planning (OMP) algorithms to advance industrial intelligence.\n\n## Current Challenges in OMP\n\nWhile previous OMP studies have achieved collision-free optimal trajectories through numerical optimization [1]-[4] or probabilistic sampling [5]-[10], two significant challenges remain:\n\n### 1. Reliability Issues\n\nNumerical methods (e.g., CHOMP [1], GPMP [2], and TrajOpt [3]) can quickly converge to a minimum using deterministic momenta/gradients. However, these approaches often encounter local minima (resulting in failed planning) when given inappropriate initial points. This limitation stems from momenta information only describing the manifold of a local space near the initial point, making it difficult to achieve reliable planning in narrow spaces.\n\n### 2. Efficiency Concerns\n\nSampling methods like STOMP [8] directly sample trajectories to find optima, while others like RRT-Connect [7] develop search trees using randomly sampled waypoints. While these approaches can generate safe trajectories without relying on manifold information, their efficiency heavily depends on the ratio of feasible subspace to overall search space. This leads to computationally intensive processes in narrow spaces.\n\n## Proposed Solution: iSAGO\n\nThis paper introduces iSAGO (Figure 1), which combines Stochastic and Accelerated Gradient information with Bayes tree-based incremental Optimization. The solution addresses both challenges:\n\n### Reliability Enhancement\n- Implements Stochastic trajectory optimization with moment adaptation (STOMA, Section IV-C)\n- Overcomes local minima in body-obstacle stuck cases through random variable selection\n- Modifies OMP's manifold with reduced local minima through stochastic momenta\n\n### Efficiency Improvement\n- Integrates accelerated gradient descent (AGD, Section IV-B) for non-stuck cases\n- Achieves optimal O(1/N^(3/2)) convergence rate in first-order convex optimization\n- Employs Bayes tree inference for incremental trajectory optimization (Section IV-A)\n- Separately optimizes convex and nonconvex sub-trajectories in iSAGO.reTrajOpt\n\n## Experimental Validation\n\nExperiments involving 15 planning tasks with 44 problems on LBR-iiwa and AUBO-i5 robots (Section V-B) demonstrate:\n- Superior reliability compared to numerical methods [1]-[3]\n- Enhanced efficiency over sampling methods [7], [8]",
        "Robotic platforms rely heavily on dynamics models for tasks such as object manipulation, motion planning, and control. A robust dynamics model is crucial for executing trajectories accurately while maintaining compliance. Traditionally, inverse dynamics models were computed using rigid body dynamics equations. However, modern systems face challenges with these approaches due to the reliance on noisy sensor data, leading to inaccuracies when models are computed analytically. Additionally, unmodeled effects such as manufacturing uncertainties, wear and tear, and friction further contribute to potential inaccuracies and undesirable behavior.\n\nTo address these issues, non-parametric models offer a data-driven approach that allows for learning non-linear functions encompassing all forces within robot dynamics. Here, the problem is framed as a mapping function from input states to output torque. Various regression methods have been successfully utilized for learning inverse dynamics models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and neural networks (NNs).\n\nGaussian processes provide accurate predictions with uncertainty estimation through their covariance functions. However, they suffer from computational challenges; their complexity scales exponentially (O(n\u00b3)) with the number of training data points, and they have quadratic space complexity. To overcome these limitations, methods like local Gaussian process regression (GPR), sparse GP regression, and drifting GPs have been developed. Despite these advancements, such methods still scale quadratically with the samples (O(n\u00b2)), limiting them to a few thousand samples.\n\nNeural networks are proficient at approximating non-linear functions and come with a time complexity of O(n), making them inherently efficient. However, standard deep models lack the ability to represent prediction uncertainty.",
        "Comparative analysis of scalar fields is a fundamental topic in scientific visualization. In recent years, topological abstractions have gained increasing interest for comparisons, offering two significant advantages over direct scalar field comparisons. Firstly, abstract comparisons focus on topological similarities, minimizing the impact of geometric symmetries. Secondly, these abstractions are usually orders of magnitude smaller than the actual domain, which is particularly important as the complexity of ensemble datasets continues to grow. One of the most studied abstractions is the merge tree, which represents the nesting of super- or sublevel sets in a rooted tree structure.\n\nA common method of analysis is the application of tree edit distances to merge trees. Tree edit distances are a well-established framework for measuring the similarity of rooted trees, offering the benefits of being intuitive, efficiently computable, and providing mappings between substructures. Additionally, the metric properties of these edit distances, along with the edit mappings, make them suitable for tasks beyond simple distance computations, such as feature tracking, interpolation, and clustering.\n\nThere has been rapid development of specialized tree edit distances, particularly for merge trees, as well as their applications in various scalar field analysis tasks. A significant challenge, however, is the presence of vertical and horizontal instabilities, as described, for example, by Saikia et al.",
        "Future wireless networks, such as sixth-generation (6G) and beyond, must support communication for an ever-increasing number of densely distributed wireless devices while maintaining low power consumption and ensuring high reliability. To meet this challenging goal, the current trend is to equip base stations (BS) or entire wireless networks with a rapidly growing number of antennas, such as those used in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, aerial users, cell-free massive MIMO, and extremely large-scale MIMO. However, this approach inevitably leads to increased hardware costs, energy consumption, and signal processing complexity, which may not fully meet the high performance and efficiency expectations of future wireless networks.\n\nA significant limitation of current MIMO communication systems is that antennas are deployed at fixed positions at the BS or distributed access points. Consequently, with a fixed number of antennas, the wireless network cannot flexibly allocate its antenna resources based on the spatially non-uniform distribution of users, beyond traditional adaptive MIMO processing techniques like transmit precoding and receive combining. Thus, with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), adaptation to changes in the 3D spatial distribution of users is very limited.\n\nRecently, six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) technology has been proposed as an effective solution to improve MIMO system capacity without adding more antennas. This is achieved by fully exploiting the adaptability of the 3D positions and rotations of a limited number of antennas at the BS. A 6DMA-enabled BS typically comprises several 6DMA surfaces, each of which can be independently adjusted in terms of both 3D position and rotation, subject to practical movement constraints. Each 6DMA surface is connected to a central processing unit (CPU) at the BS via an extendable and rotatable rod, which contains flexible wires for power supply and facilitates radio-frequency/control signal exchange. Motors at both ends of the rod, controlled by the CPU, adjust the 3D position and rotation of the connected 6DMA surface. By jointly designing and tuning the positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces according to the users' spatial distribution and corresponding long-term/statistical channel state information (CSI), 6DMA-BSs can significantly improve network capacity compared to conventional BSs with FPAs, even with slow or infrequent adjustments of the positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces. This capacity gain is primarily due to the adaptive positioning and rotating of antennas at the BS, which aligns them with the spatial user distribution, enhancing channel gains, spatial multiplexing gains, and interference mitigation capabilities, especially when user distribution is spatially non-uniform.\n\nThe 6DMA systems discussed here differ significantly from existing fluid antenna (FA) systems or 2D movable antenna (2DMA) systems and offer unique advantages. Existing FA/2DMA systems primarily consider antenna movement along a line or on a 2D surface with finite length or area, limiting their adaptability to 3D spatial user distribution variations. In contrast, the proposed 6DMA-BS can flexibly adjust the 3D positions and rotations of antennas via mechanical motors, effectively adapting to spatially non-uniform user distribution and channel statistics. Additionally, FA/2DMA systems often require frequent antenna movement to exploit instantaneous channel spatial variation, incurring high implementation costs and time overhead, especially in fast time-varying channels. The 6DMA-BS, however, moves entire antenna surfaces as basic units, reducing implementation cost and complexity, and requires less frequent adjustments as user distribution and channel statistics change slowly over time.\n\nIn previous studies, it was optimistically assumed that 3D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces could be adjusted continuously to maximize flexibility and capacity gain. However, in practice, 6DMA surfaces must be moved by physical devices like stepper motors, which adjust positions and rotations in discrete steps. This limitation reduces spatial degrees of freedom and can degrade capacity compared to continuous adjustments. Therefore, optimizing the 3D positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces becomes crucial in the discrete case, motivating this study.\n\nThis paper explores a new 6DMA system where the 6DMA-BS is equipped with finite-size antenna surfaces, such as uniform planar arrays (UPA), which can be independently adjusted in terms of 3D position and rotation from a predefined set of discrete values. Unlike existing FA/2DMA systems, which assume known instantaneous CSI or use channel estimation for antenna movement optimization, we optimize the 3D position and rotation of 6DMA surfaces based solely on statistical channel knowledge of users. This knowledge may be available a priori or not, depending on whether user channel data has been collected over time or if the BS is newly deployed or user distribution changes abruptly. We aim to maximize average network capacity with and without statistical channel knowledge.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n1. We extend the 6DMA-BS system model, continuous antenna movement constraints, and channel model to accommodate discrete position and rotation adjustments. We formulate a new optimization problem to maximize average network capacity by selecting 3D positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces, subject to discrete movement constraints.\n\n2. We propose an offline optimization method assuming a priori knowledge of channel statistics. Using the Monte Carlo method, we generate channel realizations based on statistical knowledge and approximate network capacity as the average of users' achievable sum-rates. The resulting non-convex integer program is reformulated into a tractable form with a convex feasibility set, solved efficiently via the conditional gradient method.\n\n3.",
        "Topic models (TMs), such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), reveal the thematic structure of document collections by identifying latent topics and their association with each document.  These models represent documents as mixtures of topics, where each topic is a distribution over words in the vocabulary.  Beyond document representation, TMs offer interpretability through the top key terms associated with each topic.  Recent neural topic models (NTMs) have demonstrated superior performance compared to LDA-based approaches, motivating our focus on NTMs in this work.\n\nLanguage models (LMs) excel at predicting words within sequences, effectively capturing local linguistic structures like word order. However, traditional LMs, often limited by n-gram windows or sentence boundaries, struggle to incorporate global semantic context, particularly at the document level.  Recent research has sought to bridge this gap by integrating document-level semantics from topic models into LMs, for instance, by augmenting LSTM-based LMs with document-topic proportions.\n\nExisting approaches, while incorporating document-topic proportions into LMs, overlook the valuable explanatory power of the individual topics themselves.  This explanatory representation, derived from the high-probability terms within each topic's word distribution, offers a finer-grained understanding of the thematic content. Consider the example in Figure 1(a): a topic model applied to a three-sentence document reveals the document-topic proportions (\u0125d) and the top key terms for each corresponding topic (T1, T2, and T3).  The context of \"chip\" in sentence #2 is ambiguous, but the document-topic proportions combined with the explanatory topics provide both an abstract (latent) and detailed perspective, clarifying the meaning.  This combined approach of augmenting LMs with both document-topic proportions *and* explanatory topics remains unexplored, to the best of our knowledge.\n\nTherefore, our first contribution is a novel Neural Composite Language Modeling (NCLM) framework. This framework integrates both latent document-topic proportions and explanatory topics into LMs, leveraging a NTM and a NLM.  This approach complements the latent representation with topic-specific term distributions, enriching the semantic context available to the language model.\n\n\n**(Figure 1(a) should be placed here)**\n\n**(Footnote 1 should be placed after the first mention of LDA or at the bottom of the page)**",
        "Generating natural and expressive motions for humanoid robots is a growing area of interest in both robotics and computer graphics [1]-[5]. This interest is fueled by the increasing presence of human-like robots in our daily lives, from interactive services to educational roles.  However, creating these natural motions often requires animators and artists to painstakingly design time-stamped movements.\n\nOne alternative is motion retargeting, which leverages existing motion capture or animation data.  Traditional motion retargeting involves manually mapping the movements between two different morphologies (e.g., a human actor and a robot). This requires designing or optimizing the source pose and then finding its corresponding target pose, considering kinematic constraints.  This manual mapping is labor-intensive, demanding significant effort and domain expertise.\n\nData-driven motion retargeting offers a solution by using machine learning [2]. These methods offer flexibility and scalability, reducing the need for extensive domain knowledge and tedious tuning.  Additionally, they require less computation during execution as they avoid iterative optimization. However, they require a substantial amount of training data and ensuring the feasibility (e.g., safety) of the generated motions can be challenging.\n\nThis paper introduces S\u00b3LE (Self-Supervised Shared Latent Embedding), a data-driven motion retargeting method that generates natural humanoid robot motions from motion capture data or RGB videos.  S\u00b3LE uses self-supervised learning in two key ways: 1) generating paired data for motion retargeting without relying on human motion data, and 2) learning a projection-invariant mapping to handle the differing expressivity of humans and robots.  This data generation process reduces the need for large datasets of paired human and robot movements and allows the retargeting algorithm to operate beyond the confines of the initial motion capture data.  The projection-invariant mapping, from an arbitrary human skeleton to a motion-retargetable skeleton, addresses the limitations in robot pose ranges compared to humans. By integrating the motion retargeting method from [6], which guarantees feasibility, S\u00b3LE performs online motion retargeting with safety guarantees (e.g., self-collision avoidance) under mild assumptions.\n\n\n\u2020 Sungjoon Choi is with School of Artificial Intelligence, Korea University, Seoul, Korea sungjoon-choi@korea.ac.kr.\n\u2021 Min Jae Song is with Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY, USA minjae.song@nyu.edu.\n\u00a7 Hyemin Ahn is with Chair of Human-centered Assistive Robotics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany hyemin.ahn@tum.de.",

        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# A/B Testing with Spatio-Temporal Interference: A Comprehensive Analysis\n\n## Introduction and Background\nRandomized experimentation, or A/B testing, is widely used to estimate causal effects on online platforms. Basic strategies involve partitioning the experimental units (e.g., users or time periods) into two groups randomly, and assigning one group to treatment and the other to control. However, a key challenge in modern A/B testing is interference: From two-sided markets to social networks, interference between units complicates experimentation and makes it difficult to estimate the true effect of a treatment.\n\n## Network Interference and Spillover Effects\nThe spillover effect in experimentation has been extensively studied. A majority of these works assume neighborhood interference, where the spillover effect is constrained to the direct neighborhood of an individual as given by an interference graph. Under this assumption, Ugander et al. (2013) proposed a clustering-based design, showing that if the growth rate of neighborhoods is bounded, the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator achieves an asymptotically optimal mean squared error (MSE) of \u00d5(d/N), where d is the maximum degree.\n\nFor settings where interference extends beyond direct neighbors, Leung (2022) considers a relaxed assumption where interference decays as a function of spatial distance between vertices in Euclidean space. In cases where each vertex only interferes with vertices within distance h, the HT estimator has an MSE of O(h\u00b2/N) under a suitable spatial clustering design.\n\n## Temporal Interference and Carryover Effects\nThe carryover effect (or temporal interference), where past treatments may affect future outcomes, represents another dimension of interference. Bojinov et al. 2023 considers a simple model with temporal interference bounded by a fixed window length. Other works model temporal interference arising from Markovian evolution of states, allowing for interference effects that persist across long time horizons.\n\nA common practical approach is switchback experiments, where system exposure alternates randomly between treatment and control for sufficiently long contiguous time blocks. Under this design, Hu & Wager (2022) demonstrates that the difference-in-mean (DIM) estimator with an appropriate burn-in period achieves an MSE of \u00d5(T^(-2/3)) for rapidly mixing Markov chains\u2014a rate that is optimal within the DIM estimator class.\n\n## The Challenge of Combined Interference\nWhile previous studies focused on either network or temporal interference independently, many practical settings exhibit both types simultaneously. The challenge of handling spatio-temporal interference is more complex than simply adding time as another dimension, particularly in Markovian settings where past outcomes correlate with future outcomes even when conditioned on treatments.\n\n## Our Approach and Results\nWe propose a multi-vertex Markovian model that incorporates both:\n1. Network interference between vertices via an interference graph\n2. Temporal interference from Markovian state evolutions\n\nUnder this model, we assume that:\n- Each vertex's outcome and state evolution depends only on treatments in their immediate neighborhood\n- State evolutions are independent across vertices when conditioned on treatments",
        "Proteins are involved in almost all life activities of organisms, making the study of their sequences, structures, characteristics, and roles a major area of research in the life sciences in the postgenomic era. A protein sequence can be thought of as a string of amino acid letters. The residues, structural domains, and families of amino acids that make up a protein resemble words, phrases, and sentences in human language. Therefore, machine learning methods developed for natural language and other sequences are well suited to the task of predicting proteins.\n\nMost sequence-based language models, such as BERT, XLNet, and ELECTRA, are designed to process natural language with a bias towards English. Given the notable parallels between protein sequences and the structure of natural language, employing natural language processing techniques to analyze protein sequences emerges as a logical approach.\n\nESM-2, developed by Facebook, is recognized as the most extensive protein sequence language model to date, featuring a sophisticated architecture with 48 layers and over 15 billion parameters. This groundbreaking model is trained on an expansive dataset comprising up to 250 million protein sequences sourced from Uniparc, which encompasses 86 billion amino acids. Leveraging this comprehensive base, ESM-Fold emerges as an innovative 3D protein structure prediction tool, offering swift and precise predictions from single inputs. However, challenges arise in the model's reliance on statistical analysis of amino acid compositions, affecting its ability to capture the full functional complexity of proteins.\n\nThe computational complexity of ESM-2 and ESM-Fold, coupled with their need for a large amount of computational resources, can pose obstacles for researchers without high-performance computing facilities. Additionally, while ESM-Fold shows promise in predicting protein structures from single sequences, it may struggle with proteins exhibiting complex folding patterns or requiring interactions with other molecules for accurate modeling.\n\nIn general, contributions to this research can be categorized into three main areas. One such contribution involves fusing graph pre-training with masked language modeling to refine the ESM2 model, achieving unparalleled performance in protein-centric tasks beyond what ESM2 offers.",

Introduction\n\nIn anomaly detection applications, it is common to encounter anomaly data examples whose symptoms correspond to different Severity Levels (SLs). As shown in Fig. 1a, faults can be categorized into four different SLs, from SL1 (slightest) to SL4 (most severe). The ability to accurately assess fault severity is crucial yet challenging, particularly for low-severity examples, as SL1 data clusters tend to be much closer to the normal cluster than to their corresponding SL4 clusters.\n\nThis presents a fundamental challenge: anomaly detection systems must be sensitive enough to identify low-severity faults while maintaining a low false-positive rate. When labeled data from different SLs are available, traditional regression or classification approaches can be applied. However, these fine-grained labeled datasets are often difficult to prepare, and we may not always have access to a full spectrum of anomaly SLs.\n\n## 2. Problem Statement\n\nConsider an extreme case, as illustrated in Fig. 1b, where only the two ends of the severity spectrum are available (normal condition SL0 and most severe anomaly condition SL4), with incipient anomaly instances unavailable. A classifier trained only on SL0 and SL4 data may perform well on in-distribution data but fail to identify incipient anomaly data, with most SL1 faults potentially being misclassified as normal.\n\nClassical supervised learning approaches designed for maximal separation between labeled classes (e.g., margin-based classifiers, discriminative neural networks) are less effective in detecting such low-severity, incipient anomaly examples. In the absence of labeled data for certain fault categories, common practices involve developing generative models (Gaussian mixture model, PCA, LSTM network, autoencoder). However, these models may not generalize well, potentially classifying unseen incipient anomaly instances as normal.\n\n## 3. Proposed Solution\n\nOur solution leverages ensemble learning, training multiple classifiers to recognize incipient anomalies through their joint decisions. While existing ensemble methods focus on decision uncertainty estimation, we observe that this approach becomes less effective for SL1 data close to the normal cluster. We propose:\n\n1. Increasing statistical power of base learners by moving decision boundaries toward the normal cluster\n2. Developing proper methods to combine anomaly scores from ensemble members\n\n## 4.

        "Here's the polished version of the text, enhanced for clarity and flow while maintaining the technical content:\n\n# Recent Advances in Space-Time Video Super-Resolution\n\nThe rise of Ultra-High-Definition Television (UHDTV) has transformed modern broadcasting, creating an increasing demand for UHD content. While new content can be captured using advanced UHD recorders, converting vast libraries of existing media to UHD remains impractical, resulting in a content shortage. Two technologies offer promising solutions: Video Super-Resolution (VSR), which reconstructs high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) sources, and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI), which enables smooth slow-motion playback by increasing frame rates.\n\nThis paper focuses on Space-Time Video Super-Resolution (STVSR), which combines VSR and VFI to simultaneously enhance both spatial resolution and temporal frame rate. Traditional STVSR approaches relied on rigid assumptions and hand-crafted priors, limiting their applicability. However, the deep learning revolution has transformed computer vision, advancing fields such as image super-resolution, quality assessment, deblurring, compression, and video coding. This breakthrough has enabled data-driven approaches to VFI and Super-Resolution (SR), replacing prescribed rules with neural network learning capabilities.\n\nWhile STVSR can be implemented through a two-stage process\u2014first using VFI to increase frame rate, then applying SR to enhance spatial resolution\u2014this approach has limitations. State-of-the-art VFI and SR methods offer flexibility in adjusting frame rates and spatial resolution, but they fail to leverage the intrinsic relationship between temporal and spatial information. This oversight constrains the maximum achievable resolution and leads to computational inefficiency due to redundant operations.\n\nRecent works have proposed one-stage STVSR approaches that integrate VFI and SR, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs. However, these solutions sacrifice flexibility in temporal and spatial resolution adjustment. The CNN used for intermediate frame synthesis is restricted to specific target times, while the pixelshuffle or deconvolution layers prevent adjustable up-sampling factors without network modification or retraining.\n\nTo address these limitations, we present the Unconstrained Space-Time Video Super-Resolution Network (USTVSRNet), which enables arbitrary temporal and spatial resolution scaling.

        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# Neural Networks, Transfer Learning, and Meta-Learning: A Technical Overview\n\nDeep convolutional neural networks have revolutionized image classification accuracy. However, these networks require massive training datasets to achieve optimal performance. Consider ResNet [1], whose variants (from ResNet-18 to ResNet-152) were trained on ImageNet [2]\u2014a dataset comprising 1,281,167 images across 1,000 classes, averaging approximately 1,200 samples per class.\n\nFor many practical applications, assembling and labeling such extensive datasets proves unfeasible. Consequently, training deep convolutional networks from scratch often yields suboptimal results. To address this limitation, researchers typically employ transfer learning: taking an ImageNet-pretrained network and fine-tuning it on a smaller, target dataset [1], [3], [4].\n\nHowever, two significant challenges persist:\n\n1. Training with limited examples per class remains difficult, contrasting sharply with human learning capabilities\u2014where children can often learn from a single example.\n\n2. Predicting how well an ImageNet-pretrained network will perform on a target dataset is challenging, leading to a model selection dilemma: superior performance on ImageNet doesn't necessarily translate to better results on smaller, specific datasets.\n\nMeta-learning, particularly its few-shot learning benchmark, offers a promising solution to these challenges. This approach trains networks across various randomly sampled tasks, encouraging the development of more generalizable features applicable across multiple domains rather than specialized features for a single task.\n\n## Focus on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)\n\nOur research examines Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) [5], a pioneering optimization-based meta-learning method that has influenced numerous subsequent approaches. MAML's training process consists of two distinct phases: adaptation and meta-gradient updates. Previous research has identified that MAML's adaptation phase is computationally intensive [6], contributing to a broader challenge of neural network execution speed in practical applications [7].\n\nThis work introduces gradient update patterns\u2014a selective approach to updating neural network weights during the adaptation phase. We demonstrate that carefully chosen gradient update patterns can:\n\n1. Accelerate MAML's adaptation phase\n2. Substantially improve performance when limited to a single adaptation phase\n\nWe validate our findings using the CIFAR-FS dataset [8], a widely recognized benchmark for few-shot learning.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nIn modern power systems, voltage source converters (VSCs) are among the most prevalent power electronic devices. VSCs find widespread application across various scenarios, from renewable energy generation (such as wind farms) to high-voltage DC and flexible AC transmission systems [1]-[3]. Recent literature [3]-[8] indicates that the high penetration of power converters has significantly altered power system dynamics, giving rise to new oscillatory phenomena that threaten system stability. Many of these phenomena are linked to VSC control.\n\nBoth industry and academia recognize that identifying oscillation sources is crucial for oscillation suppression [9], [10]. A comprehensive survey in [11] categorized various oscillation source location (OSL) methods, with the energy-based method (EBM) [12] emerging as particularly noteworthy. The EBM tracks system-wide energy flow to pinpoint oscillation sources and offers several advantages:\n1. Unlike methods based on damping torque analysis or mode shape estimation, the EBM can locate both forced oscillations and poorly damped oscillations [11]\n2. The method readily accommodates voltage/current measurements in wide-area networks [12], [13]\n\nWith the advancement of phasor measurement units (PMU), the EBM has proven successful in real-world power system oscillation monitoring [14], making it particularly relevant for industrial applications.\n\nRecent years have seen significant developments in the EBM. Wu et al. [13] introduced a distributed cooperative scheme for locating forced oscillation sources through cut-set energy flow detection. Several studies have specifically addressed oscillations in wind farm contexts. Ma et al. [15] developed an equipment-level method for locating low-frequency oscillation sources in power systems with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) integration, utilizing an energy correlation topology network and dynamic energy flow analysis. Lei et al. [16] proposed a method for forced oscillation source location and participation assessment in DFIGs through energy flow analysis, introducing an oscillation participation factor.\n\nThe energy flow formulas in [13], [15], and [16], suitable for low-frequency OSL, were derived from [12] and validated against dissipativity theory in [17] and [18]. However, research has shown that multi-VSC systems risk sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) [4], [6], making transient energy flow (TEF) analysis crucial for locating VSC control-induced oscillations.\n\n[Author affiliations and remaining sections follow with similar improvements in clarity and structure...]\n\nThe text maintains its technical precision while improving readability through:\n- Clearer paragraph structure\n- More precise transitions between ideas\n- Better sentence flow\n- Consistent formatting of citations\n- Bulleted lists for better organization of key points\n- Maintained academic tone while reducing redundancy",
        "Ensuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is essential for their broad acceptance and public trust. Verification and validation are crucial to the safety of AV systems at all stages of their development, from simulations to on-road testing. Conventional testing methods often require the existence of known scenarios, which will later be used to verify the AVs at the system level. Identifying such scenarios in different operational design domains (ODD) (SAE, 2018) poses a great challenge due to the many possible variants that can occur in reality (Beringhoff et al., 2022).\n\nAn emerging approach, adaptive stress testing (AST), offers a solution to this challenge using a bottom-up perspective (Corso et al., 2019; Lytskjold and Mengshoel, 2023; Hjelmeland et al., 2022). The goal of AST is to identify potential failure scenarios and their likelihoods. Specifically, it is designed to discover the most probable system failure events, traditionally formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Ritchie et al., 2015; Mark et al., 2018). In this process, reinforcement learning (RL) is often employed alongside domain knowledge to efficiently explore the vast state space and identify failure events. The search process is guided by a reward function that encourages failures, such as collisions and near-misses, with high transition probabilities.\n\nRecently, AST has been used in the literature to explore the failure patterns of the intelligent driving model (IDM) under test (Zhang et al., 2023). Prior to its application in self-driving traffic, AST achieved success in various related applications, including aircraft collision avoidance evaluation (Ritchie et al., 2015), maritime collision avoidance (Hjelmeland et al., 2022; Lytskjold and Mengshoel, 2023), and autonomous vehicle pedestrian collision avoidance (Mark et al., 2018; Koren et al., 2020; Corso et al., 2019; Mark and Mykel, 2019; Mark et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, existing AST-based studies for AV driving have several limitations. First, the scenarios used for testing are basic and do not include the complexity of real-life driving situations. For example, Mark et al. (2018) used a simple scenario where an intelligent ego vehicle approaches a crosswalk with a pedestrian crossing in front of it. This test did not consider the actions of surrounding vehicles. Second, the traditional IDMs under test are simple and do not account for sophisticated, realistic driving behaviors. To address this limitation, Peter and Katherine (2021) proposed an IDM with more complex actions, such as changing lanes, accelerating, decelerating, and maintaining a constant speed, which were incorporated into a Deep Q Network (DQN) (Fan et al., 2020) model. However, these actions were constrained to the AV moving forward along the longitudinal direction only, without considering lateral movements.\n\nTo fill these gaps, we propose a novel AST framework based on the development of a comprehensive IDM model to reflect a realistic and complex driving environment on a highway. The proposed framework addresses the above-mentioned limitations. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n- Develop a unified intelligent driving model (uIDM) that facilitates AV movement in both longitudinal and lateral directions, enabling the testing of autonomous driving in more realistic and complex scenarios.\n- Propose a novel AST framework to stress test the AV in a complex highway environment. Our framework includes a new reward function that encourages safe driving among other vehicles on the highway while supporting the identification of potential crash scenarios.\n- Calibrate the framework using observations from California's accident reports and then assess its performance against existing IDMs, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.\n\nThe rest of our paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review related studies of AST and intelligent vehicles, discuss the existing approaches, and highlight research gaps in this area. In Section 3, we propose our framework, including the development of a comprehensive intelligent driving model and a novel reward function to identify potential corner cases using the proposed intelligent driving model in complex highway traffic.",
        "Advancements in energy-efficient, compact, and cost-effective embedded devices have brought time series data to the forefront of numerous research fields, including healthcare [1]-[3], finance [4], [5], and speech and activity recognition [6]-[8], among others [9]-[11]. Time series data possesses inherent temporal dependencies among its data points, enabling researchers to analyze processes over time. Additionally, time series data naturally appeals to human curiosity by allowing visualization of its structure or shape [12]. A variety of algorithms have been developed to explore different aspects of time series, such as forecasting [13], clustering [14], and classification [15]. Forecasting algorithms aim to predict future data points [13], while clustering algorithms seek to partition unlabeled time series instances into groups based on similarity [14]. Classification algorithms strive to predict the class label of an unlabeled time series by learning a mapping from training instances to their labels [15], [16].\n\nTime Series Classification (TSC) has gained considerable interest, especially with the availability of labeled dataset repositories like UCR [17] and UCI [18]. This interest has led to the development of numerous TSC algorithms employing efficient and innovative strategies for distinguishing classes. Research in [16], [19], [20] focuses on instance-based learning, where a time series's class label is predicted through similarity measures. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [21] and its variations [16], [20] with 1-Nearest Neighbors (1-NN) are commonly used in instance-based TSC algorithms.\n\nRecently, deep learning-based TSC algorithms, as discussed in [22], have shown significant progress. Notably, robust TSC algorithms have been proposed using the ResNet [23] and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [24] frameworks. The authors in [25] introduced a reservoir computing approach to generate new representations of Multivariate Time Series (MTS), integrating it into recurrent neural networks to avoid the computational cost of backpropagation during classification. In [26], a multivariate TSC approach combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) models with an attention mechanism. Recent studies [27], [28] have employed generative adversarial networks for TSC, effectively modeling the data's temporal dynamics.\n\nThe primary goal of TSC algorithms is to maximize classifier accuracy using complete time series. However, in time-sensitive applications like gas leakage detection [29], earthquake prediction [30], and electricity demand forecasting [31], maximizing earliness by classifying incomplete time series is crucial. This approach, known as early classification [32]-[34], focuses on classifying an incomplete time series. Xing et al. [32] noted that achieving earliness often comes at the expense of accuracy, presenting a challenge to balance these conflicting objectives. One of the earliest approaches to early classification of time series was proposed in [35], sparking significant research and numerous publications in this area. Despite an exhaustive search, only a minor survey [36] was found, which covered a limited number of early classification approaches without categorization.\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of early classification approaches for both univariate and multivariate time series data. Initially, we discuss the potential applications motivating research in early classification. Section 1 details these applications. In Section III, we outline the research methodology for searching, filtering, and selecting the reviewed papers. Section IV delves into the fundamentals of early classification approaches and their categorization. We divide these approaches into four categories based on the strategies researchers employed for early classification, with detailed discussions in subsequent sections. Finally, Section IX summarizes the review, addressing the challenges of the solution approaches and offering recommendations for future work.",

While it can be implemented at various stages, SLT is typically conducted either:\n- By circuit manufacturers during final production\n- By circuit buyers (e.g., automotive Tier-1 suppliers) during incoming quality control\n- During post-silicon characterization, where a circuit's extrafunctional properties are measured across hundreds or thousands of \"first-silicon\" circuits\n\n## Current Challenges\nUnlike conventional structural and functional test methods, which are built on established theoretical concepts (fault models, detection concepts, and coverage metrics), SLT lacks fundamental theoretical understanding. Even the term \"system-level test\" itself carries different meanings across the industry. This gap in theoretical foundation presents several critical questions:\n\n1. What precisely defines SLT in semiconductor testing, and how does it differ from traditional structural and functional test approaches?\n2. What causes SLT-unique failures in circuits that previously passed structural and functional tests?\n3. How can we determine failure root causes during SLT without established diagnostic methods?\n4. How can we leverage knowledge from software engineering (e.g., coverage definitions, stress test generation) in this context?\n\n## Scope and Objectives\nThis paper aims to establish initial theoretical foundations for SLT by:\n- Examining our current understanding of these questions\n- Drawing insights from related scientific disciplines\n- Discussing current explanations and hypotheses, even when controversial or contradictory\n- Acknowledging areas where definitive answers remain unknown\n\n---\n*\u00a92020 IEEE.

        "Machine learning is experiencing a renaissance powered by transformers. Over the past five years, neural architectures for natural language processing, vision, and several other domains have largely been overtaken by transformers. However, many classes of image-level generative models have resisted this trend. While transformers are widely used in autoregressive models, they have seen less adoption in other generative modeling frameworks. For instance, diffusion models, which have been at the forefront of recent advances in image-level generative models, predominantly use a convolutional U-Net architecture as the de facto backbone. The groundbreaking work by Ho et al. first introduced the U-Net backbone for diffusion models. Initially, U-Net, having achieved success in pixel-level autoregressive models and conditional GANs, was adapted from Pixel-CNN++ with a few modifications. The model is convolutional, primarily consisting of ResNet blocks. Unlike the standard U-Net, the architecture incorporates additional spatial self-attention blocks, essential components in transformers, at lower resolutions. Dhariwal and Nichol explored various architectural choices for the U-Net, such as the use of adaptive normalization layers to inject conditional information, and the number of channels in convolutional layers. Nonetheless, the U-Net's high-level design, as proposed by Ho et al, has largely remained the same. \n\nIn this work, we aim to demystify the significance of architectural choices in diffusion models and provide empirical baselines for future generative modeling research. We demonstrate that the U-Net's inductive bias is not crucial to the performance of diffusion models, and it can be readily replaced with standard designs, such as transformers.",
        "Interactive 3D segmentation using radiance fields has garnered significant attention from researchers, thanks to its potential applications in various domains such as scene manipulation, automatic labeling, and virtual reality. Previous methods primarily involved translating 2D visual features into 3D space by training feature fields to mimic multi-view 2D features extracted by self-supervised visual models. The resulting 3D feature similarities are then used to determine whether two points belong to the same object. While these approaches are fast due to their simple segmentation pipeline, the segmentation granularity may be coarse as they lack a mechanism for parsing the embedded information in the features, like a segmentation decoder.\n\nIn contrast, another approach proposes lifting the 2D segmentation foundation model to 3D by directly projecting multi-view fine-grained 2D segmentation results onto 3D mask grids. While this method can provide precise segmentation results, its significant time overhead limits interactivity due to multiple executions of the foundation model and volume rendering, making it impractical for complex scenes with multiple objects needing segmentation.\n\nThe above discussion highlights the current challenge faced by existing paradigms in balancing efficiency and accuracy, identifying two key factors hindering the performance of existing methods. First, the use of implicit radiance fields in previous approaches impedes efficient segmentation, requiring traversal of 3D space to identify a 3D object. Second, while employing a 2D segmentation decoder yields high segmentation quality, it results in lower efficiency.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a new approach building on the recent advancements in radiance fields, particularly leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-quality and real-time rendering. By representing the 3D scene with a set of 3D colored Gaussians, 3DGS acts as a point cloud, offering explicit 3D prior and enabling efficient rendering, making it ideal for segmentation tasks.\n\nBuilding on 3DGS, we introduce Segment Any 3D GAussians (SAGA) by distilling the fine-grained segmentation ability of a 2D segmentation foundation model into 3D Gaussians. This novel strategy allows for fine-grained 3D segmentation without the need for multiple forwarding of the 2D segmentation model during inference. The distillation process involves training 3D features for Gaussians based on automatically extracted masks with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In inference, a set of queries is generated with input prompts to efficiently retrieve the expected Gaussians through feature matching.\n\nSAGA achieves fine-grained 3D segmentation in milliseconds and supports various prompt types such as points, scribbles, and masks. Evaluation on existing benchmarks demonstrates that SAGA's segmentation quality is comparable to the previous state-of-the-art.\n\nAs the first interactive segmentation approach using 3D Gaussians, SAGA is versatile, accommodating various prompt types. Our evaluation on existing benchmarks shows that SAGA performs on par with the state-of-the-art, with training of Gaussian features typically concluding within 5-10 minutes. Subsequently, segmentation of most target objects can be completed in milliseconds, achieving nearly 1000\u00d7 acceleration.",

However, countless ancient artifacts have succumbed to time's passage, environmental degradation, or human intervention, necessitating careful preservation and restoration. Recent years have seen remarkable advances in deep learning technology for restoring cultural relics, spanning pottery, architecture, and murals.\n\nAmong cultural heritage elements, written language stands as humanity's foremost vehicle of thought, preserving our history through symbolic representation. The restoration of ancient texts aims to reconstruct fragmented scripts, traditionally requiring extensive expertise in philology and linguistics\u2014a highly specialized and demanding endeavor.\n\nOur research applies multimodal deep learning methodology to ancient text restoration, focusing specifically on ideographs. These writing systems encode meaning through visual symbols, with each character maintaining a distinct visual identity. The restoration process thus depends on both contextual information and visual evidence.\n\nWe present the Multimodal Multitask Restoring Model (MMRM), an innovative approach to ideograph restoration that:\n- Synthesizes readable context with residual visual information from damaged artifacts\n- Employs multitask learning to simultaneously predict damaged characters and generate restored images\n\nOur experimental validation encompassed both simulated data and authentic ancient inscriptions. The results demonstrate that MMRM significantly improves ideograph restoration accuracy in simulated environments and provides reliable character recommendations for real-world damaged texts.

        "Here's the polished version of the text, with improved readability, coherence, and flow:\n\n# Privacy-Preserving Data Release: Current Challenges and Solutions\n\nThe challenge of private data release has gained significant prominence in recent years, encompassing both privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) [30] [40] and privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS) [5] [7] [25] [44]. Organizations frequently need to outsource analytical tasks to third-party data scientists or even different divisions within the same company, while protecting sensitive information. This outsourcing raises privacy concerns, as private datasets containing census information, health records, and financial data could be exposed to untrusted parties. The proliferation of data science and smart devices has led to the collection of high-dimensional, complex personal data, such as facial authentication images and location tracking. Each scenario presents unique opportunities, privacy risks, and potential adversaries.\n\n## Traditional Approaches and Their Limitations\n\nIn PPDP, k-anonymity [40] has been a conventional approach, with numerous anonymization algorithms developed for various data domains [4] [16] [30]. However, k-anonymity's primary limitation is its failure to account for adversaries' background knowledge.\n\n## Differential Privacy: The New Gold Standard\n\nFor private statistical aggregate release, differential privacy (DP) has emerged as the gold standard privacy framework [17]. DP provides robust privacy guarantees without making assumptions about the adversary's capabilities. It ensures that analytical results remain approximately the same whether or not any individual's data is included in the input database. DP has found applications across numerous domains [7] [11] [36], and its significance is highlighted by the U.S. Census Bureau's decision to implement differential privacy for protecting 2020 Census results [3] [9].\n\n## Differentially Private Data Synthesis (DPDS)\n\nDPDS constructs a differentially private generative model to produce privacy-preserving synthetic data from sensitive information. This well-researched approach [5] [12] [25] [42] [44] [45] protects privacy by sharing only the DP-compliant generative model rather than raw datasets (Figure 1). Recently, NIST organized a competition for developing effective DPDS mechanisms while maintaining data utility [35].\n\n## Requirements and Challenges\n\nAn effective generative model should:\n1. Generate data that follows the actual data distribution\n2.",
        "Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are a powerful tool for various NLP tasks like machine translation (MT), morphological inflection (MI), and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P).  However, these models exhibit a bias towards short hypotheses, contributing to the \"beam search curse\" where increasing beam width counterintuitively decreases performance (Koehn and Knowles, 2017; Yang et al., 2018; Murray and Chi-ang, 2018).  This bias is so severe that the highest-scoring target sequence is often the empty string, a phenomenon termed the \"cat got your tongue\" problem (Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019).  Ideally, models should prioritize good translations over bad ones, rather than relying on search errors to compensate for model inadequacies.\n\nCommonly, this shortcoming is addressed by modifying the decoding objective (Wu et al., 2016; He et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018; Meister et al., 2020a).  However, this approach fails to address the root issue: the model's overestimation of implausible hypotheses' probabilities.  Alternative training strategies exist (Murray and Chiang, 2018; Shen et al., 2016), but altering the training algorithm is not ideal.\n\nThis paper proposes a solution using sparse seq2seq models (Peters et al., 2019), which replace the softmax output layer with the entmax transformation.  Unlike softmax, entmax learns locally sparse distributions over the target vocabulary, allowing the model to assign zero probability to inadequate hypotheses, effectively shrinking the search space. This has been demonstrated for MI, where the smaller hypothesis space allows for exact beam search (Peters et al., 2019; Peters and Martins, 2019). We extend this analysis to MT. While exact beam search is infeasible in MT due to the large vocabulary, we show that entmax effectively prunes many inadequate hypotheses, mitigating the \"cat got your tongue\" problem.\n\nOne drawback of entmax is its incompatibility with label smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016), a valuable regularization technique commonly used with transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017).  We address this by generalizing label smoothing from cross-entropy loss to the broader class of Fenchel-Young losses (Blondel et al., 2020), which includes entmax loss. This novel formulation of label smoothing, when combined with entmax, improves performance on both character- and word-level tasks while maintaining sparsity.  Interestingly, while label smoothing improves calibration, it also exacerbates the \"cat got your tongue\" problem, irrespective of the loss function.\n\nIn summary, our contributions are threefold:\n\n1. We empirically demonstrate that entmax-trained models rarely assign non-zero probability to the empty string, effectively addressing a major class of NMT model errors.\n2. We introduce a novel generalization of label smoothing applicable to Fenchel-Young losses, including entmax loss.\n3. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Fenchel-Young label smoothing with entmax loss on both character- and word-level tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the SIGMORPHON 2020 shared task for multilingual G2P (Gorman et al., 2020) and improvements on cross-lingual MI (SIGMORPHON 2019; McCarthy et al., 2019) and MT tasks (IWSLT 2017 German \u2194 English (Cettolo et al., 2017), KFTT Japanese \u2194 English (Neubig, 2011), and WMT 2016 Romanian \u2194 English (Bojar et al., 2016)).",
        "Model predictive controllers (MPCs) have a wide array of applications that rely on timeseries forecasts as key parameters. For instance, cellular network traffic schedulers predict citywide mobility data to allocate base station connections to mobile devices [1]; power grid operators utilize electricity demand patterns to optimize battery storage [2], [3]; and stock traders employ price forecasts to guide trading decisions. In these scenarios, the timeseries data are provided by external sources rather than being generated or measured by the controllers themselves. We term these as input-driven controllers, which utilize reliable estimates of both internal control states and external timeseries forecasts to make decisions, known as actions or controls. Since controllers passively receive external timeseries, a pertinent question arises: how reliable are these timeseries forecasts?\n\nIn this paper, we leverage the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to explore how epistemic uncertainty or malicious external sources can impact control costs or constraints. We extend this analysis to encompass convex MPC controllers.\n\n**Related Work:** Our system model closely resembles that in [2], which introduces an input-driven LQR controller with external timeseries forecasts. However, unlike our study, their focus is on optimal compression of timeseries over a bandwidth-limited network, while we concentrate on adversarial attacks.\n\nAdversarial attacks involve making subtle, often imperceptible, perturbations to sensory inputs (e.g., images) to induce errors in output predictions (i.e., image classifications). Reference [4] examines adversarial attacks on probabilistic autoregressive models, whereas [5], [6] focus on adversarial noise in image classification. Works [7] through [11] study adversarial attacks that affect the dynamics of reinforcement learning (RL) agents. In contrast, our research exploits the structure of a model-based control task to create adversarial attacks on timeseries inputs.\n\nAdversarial attacks in control systems have also been investigated in [12], [13], [14]. These works frame the adversarial attack on a controller as a max-min problem, where the adversary aims to maximize costs while the controller seeks to minimize them. In [12], the adversary introduces perturbations to the dataset of a nonlinear data-driven controller, while in [13], [14], the perturbations directly affect the controller's states. Our research is distinct in focusing on how an adversary can alter external timeseries forecasts to (a) maximize control costs and (b) cause a controller to nearly violate its strict state and control constraints. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to detail how to introduce attacks that almost breach state and control constraints, which is crucial in practice, such as for energy limits.\n\n**Insights and Contributions:** Our key technical insight is that input-driven controllers are highly sensitive to errors in external timeseries and can be attacked in various ways, such as increasing control costs, activating constraints, or rendering the control optimization problem infeasible.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Understanding Memorization in Large Language Models: A Comparative Study of Code and Natural Language\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) with their exceptional accuracy across various tasks [36]. As these models grow from millions to billions of parameters, they demonstrate increased accuracy and emergent abilities [52]. Notably, LLMs designed for coding, trained on vast amounts of code data, excel at tasks like generation [21], summarization [1], and code completion [30].\n\n## Emergent Capabilities and Scaling\n\nLarge language models exhibit emergent capabilities that only manifest beyond certain parameter thresholds [50]. These abilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting [51] and instruction tuning [42], typically emerge in models exceeding 100B parameters [50]. This phenomenon drives the push toward larger models, despite potential drawbacks.\n\n## The Memorization Challenge\n\n### Natural Language Memorization\nMany researchers have documented that LLMs trained on natural language can memorize substantial amounts of their training data [2, 5, 9, 11, 12, 15, 19, 23, 29, 32, 37, 46, 48]. This memorization raises significant privacy concerns, as private information can be embedded in the training data [10, 13, 28].\n\n### Code-Specific Memorization Concerns\nThe memorization of source code presents unique challenges compared to natural language:\n\n1. **Legal Implications**: Source code is governed by specific licenses that differ from natural language content [16, 23]. Many open-source projects use non-permissive copyleft licenses (GPL, CC-BY-SA), making unauthorized code reuse potentially illegal [2].\n\n2. **Privacy Risks**: Code can contain sensitive information like credentials, API keys, and emails [2, 4].\n\n3. **Ethical Considerations**: Sharing code without proper licensing raises ethical concerns [2, 23, 46].\n\n## Security Implications\n\nRecent attacks have successfully extracted training data from LLMs [3, 5, 13, 29]. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) considers data reconstruction attacks particularly concerning [41], and OWASP ranks Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM06) as a critical vulnerability. Larger models are especially vulnerable to data extraction [5, 13, 29, 41].\n\n## Our Research Contribution\n\nThis study presents the first empirical investigation of memorization in code-focused LLMs. Our key contributions include:\n\n1. A novel data extraction security game framework for quantifying memorization\n2. A comprehensive benchmark of memorization characteristics across 10 models\n3. Empirical findings showing that:\n   - Code models memorize training data, though less than natural language models\n   - Larger models exhibit increased memorization\n   - Data carriers show higher memorization rates than standard code\n   - Different architectures memorize different samples\n4. Publicly available evaluation code for result replication\n\nOur research demonstrates that code-focused LLMs face similar memorization challenges as their natural language counterparts, with important implications for privacy, security, and ethical deployment.",

Effectively detecting these social bots is crucial for mitigating their detrimental societal and economic impact while preserving the integrity of social network information.\n\nTraditional bot detection techniques rely heavily on feature extraction, whether through numerical features from user information [Yang et al., 2013] or semantic features from textual content [Wei and Nguyen, 2019; Duki\u0107 et al., 2020]. However, bot operators frequently circumvent detection through advanced countermeasures, a phenomenon known as bot evolution [Cresci, 2020]. Feature-based methods are particularly vulnerable to imitation and evasion tactics, as operators can easily appropriate information from legitimate users or intersperse malicious content among neutral messages [Feng et al., 2022b].\n\nRecent advances in graph neural networks have led researchers to explore graph-based methods [Wu et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2023a] for identifying disguised social bots. These approaches leverage the observation that social bots typically exhibit different network structures compared to legitimate users. For instance, bots tend to have sparser connections and random interaction patterns, while humans generally connect with others sharing similar characteristics [Yang et al., 2013]. While these graph-based methods have shown promising results, they typically treat social networks as static graphs, overlooking their inherently dynamic nature. This limitation presents two significant challenges:\n\n1. **Deficiency in Historical Interaction Context**: Even as bots evolve to mimic legitimate network structures [Cresci, 2020], their historical interaction patterns often reveal their true nature. Current static graph approaches, focusing solely on the network's current state, fail to leverage this valuable historical context, making it difficult to identify well-disguised bots.\n\n2. **Limited Modeling of Evolving Behavior Patterns**: Social bots continuously adapt their strategies and interaction patterns to evade detection, while legitimate users maintain relatively consistent behavior patterns. Static graph methods cannot effectively model these distinct evolutionary trajectories, leading to reduced detection accuracy.\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose BotDGT (Bot Detection with Dynamic Graph Transformers), a novel framework that incorporates social network dynamics into bot detection. BotDGT models social networks as dynamic graphs, representing users as nodes and interactions as edges, captured through time-sequenced snapshots. The framework comprises:\n\n- A structural module utilizing message-passing mechanisms to model topological patterns within each historical snapshot\n- A temporal module employing self-attention mechanisms to analyze historical contexts and distinguish between bot and human behavior evolution patterns\n\nOur key contributions include:\n\n1. Pioneer implementation of dynamic graph characterization for detecting evolving social bots that adapt their behavior patterns\n2. Development of a novel detection framework that integrates both topological structure and temporal dynamics of social networks\n3. Comprehensive experimental validation on two benchmarks, demonstrating BotDGT's superior performance in accuracy, recall, and F1-score compared to existing methods",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nDisinformation is proliferating across the internet, often driven by political agendas [1, 2]. In response, platforms have begun implementing warning systems to inform and guide users. Facebook pioneered this approach in December 2016 [3], followed by Google [4], Bing [5], and Twitter [6]. The implementation of these warnings has sparked significant public discourse, particularly after Twitter began flagging tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump in May 2020 [7]. However, current research provides limited evidence of these warnings' effectiveness in influencing user behavior or beliefs, leaving their utility in combating disinformation uncertain.\n\nThis challenge mirrors one faced by security researchers over a decade ago, when studies revealed that warnings about malware, phishing, and other online threats were largely ineffective [8, 9]. Through extensive, iterative research [10-21], security warnings have evolved to successfully guide user decisions and protect against harmful content [10, 17]. Our research applies these established security warning methodologies to develop and assess effective disinformation warnings.\n\nA crucial insight from security research that we apply to disinformation is the superior effectiveness of interstitial warnings\u2014which interrupt users and require interaction\u2014compared to contextual warnings that neither interrupt nor demand action [8, 9, 17]. Our study represents the first evaluation of interstitial warnings in the context of disinformation.\n\nWe also incorporate the security field's robust evaluation methods, including structured models, realistic guided tasks, user interviews, and field studies [11, 13, 15-18]. These methodologies inform our empirical analysis of both contextual and interstitial disinformation warnings.\n\nOur research encompasses two studies examining the following questions:\n\n1. How frequently do users modify their behavior by seeking alternative information sources after encountering contextual and interstitial disinformation warnings?\n2. What factors influence users' decisions to maintain their behavior despite these warnings?\n3. Can highly informative interstitial warnings effectively alter user behavior?\n4. Can threatening interstitial warnings effectively alter user behavior?\n\nOur initial laboratory experiment (n = 40) observed participants conducting Google searches while encountering either interstitial or contextual warnings for specific results (Section 3). The interstitial warnings proved significantly more effective at influencing behavior, largely because users often overlooked or misunderstood the subtler contextual warnings. Post-task interviews revealed two key factors behind the interstitial warnings' effectiveness: clear, informative messaging and the perceived risk communicated through threatening design elements.\n\nA subsequent crowdworker study (n = 238) evaluated eight interstitial warning designs (Section 4). This study confirmed the strong behavioral impact of interstitial warnings but surprisingly found that neither user comprehension nor perceived risk significantly moderated these effects.\n\nOur findings demonstrate that interstitial disinformation warnings can successfully inform users and influence behavior. We present scalable, replicable methods for measuring warning effectiveness and testing effect theories. However, our research also reveals a potential concern: the behavioral impact of these warnings may stem more from user interface friction than informed decision-making. While our work establishes a foundation for designing effective warnings, we advocate for continued iterative research and refinement of disinformation warnings, following the successful model established by the information security community.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nModern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are heavily dependent on large annotated image datasets [29]. This data-intensive nature restricts their practical applications, particularly in domains like autonomous driving, where data annotation is cost-prohibitive or involves novel concepts [9, 51]. In contrast, humans can quickly grasp new concepts and make meaningful generalizations from minimal exposure [31]. To address this disparity, researchers have renewed their interest in few-shot or low-shot learning, which aims to master novel concepts from limited labeled examples [8, 10, 34, 37, 42].\n\nWhile this field has seen notable progress, most research has concentrated on simple classification tasks using artificial settings and small-scale datasets [34, 37]. Few-shot object detection\u2014a task of significant practical importance that involves learning to detect objects from minimal annotated examples [18, 38, 39]\u2014remains relatively unexplored. This task is substantially more challenging than few-shot classification, as it requires both locating and identifying objects while managing background distractions [13]. The most demanding scenario occurs when novel classes have extremely limited examples (fewer than 3), a common yet exceptionally challenging real-world situation (Figure 1).\n\nAlthough few-shot classification approaches offer valuable insights [2, 4, 18, 33, 41], few-shot detection presents unique challenges beyond their scope.",
        "The fundamental goal of machine learning algorithms is to identify the conditional distribution given any input and its label. In the training phase, it\u2019s conventional to assume that the underlying classifier or function belongs to a certain class of functions, thus presuming that the approximation error is insignificant. This practice allows the training to focus on reducing the estimation error, which is the major error a classifier develops due to incomplete data training. The estimation error can be further decomposed into optimization and generalization errors, which are greatly complementary.\n\nThe features of the objective function, such as convexity, strong convexity, and smoothness, influence the optimization error. Additionally, the convergence rate of the optimization problem depends on the algorithm used to solve it. For instance, some algorithms have a linear convergence rate, while others may exhibit a sublinear or superlinear convergence rate. The computational complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the computer resources it utilizes to solve the optimization problem, quantified in units of storage, time, dimension, or all three simultaneously.\n\nA common methodology to quantify the computational complexity of optimization algorithms is by counting the gradient evaluations required to obtain an optimal solution with a given accuracy. The Gradient Descent algorithm, a popular deterministic optimization algorithm, has a linear convergence rate under assumptions of \u00b5-strong convexity and L-smoothness, with a computational complexity of O(L/\u00b5N log 1) for N data objective function. On the other hand, the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm, which randomly picks a single function every iteration, has a different computational complexity of O(1) per iteration. When N is large, preferred methods for solving optimization or sampling problems often rely on stochastic estimates of the gradient of f.\n\nStandard variance reduction techniques used for stochastic optimizations require additional storage or the computation of full gradients. Another approach for variance reduction is through adaptively increasing the sample size used to compute gradient approximations. Some adaptive sampling optimization methods have been studied in works by researchers such as Richard H. Byrd, Wu, Fatemeh S. Hashemi, and Pasupathy. These methods have optimal complexity properties, making them useful for various applications. For example, Fatemeh S. Hashemi and Pasupathy (2014) introduced a variance-bias ratio test reinforced by a backup mechanism that ensures a geometric increase in the sample size.",
        "Transfer Learning\n\nTransfer learning is a widely embraced paradigm in machine learning that involves leveraging knowledge from a well-studied learning problem (referred to as the source task) to enhance the performance of a new learning problem with similar features (known as the target task). In deep learning applications where there is limited and relevant data, transfer learning is a common practice that involves utilizing large datasets like ImageNet and their corresponding pre-trained models such as ResNet50. This approach has proven successful across various domains, including natural language processing (Ruder et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019), sentiment analysis (Liu et al., 2019), computer vision (Ganin et al., 2016; Wang and Deng, 2018), activity recognition (Cook et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018), medical data analysis (Wang et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022), bioinformatics (Hwang and Kuang, 2010), recommendation systems (Pan et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2019), and fraud detection (Lebichot et al., 2020). For further insights, refer to review papers like (Pan and Yang, 2010; Tan et al., 2018; Zhuang et al., 2020) and the associated references. In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, where new machine learning techniques and tools emerge rapidly, transfer learning stands out as a versatile and enduring paradigm. The empirical successes of transfer learning have also spurred theoretical studies, especially focusing on quantifiable ways to determine the suitability of transfer learning in specific contexts; see, for example, (Mousavi Kalan et al., 2020), (Nguyen et al., 2020), (You et al., 2021), (Huang et al., 2022), (Nguyen et al., 2022), (Tripuraneni et al., 2020), (Galanti et al., 2022), and (Cao et al., 2023).\n\nTransfer Learning in Finance\n\nTransfer learning has recently gained popularity in the finance sector, where limited data availability and excessive noise have posed challenges for practitioners in tasks like equity fund recommendation (Zhang et al., 2018) and stock price prediction (Wu et al., 2022; Nguyen and Yoon, 2019). Instead of starting from scratch for each task, transfer learning enables financial practitioners to leverage knowledge and patterns from related tasks or domains, leading to more accurate predictions and enhanced decision-making capabilities.\n\nFor example, Zhang et al. (2018) tackled the issue of equity fund investment by providing personalized recommendations on \"what to buy.\" Due to the lack of transaction data in the equity fund market, they applied transfer learning by using the profile of investors in the stock market to construct profiles for the fund market. This profile played a crucial role in developing the utility-based recommendation algorithm. Leal et al. (2020) introduced a deep neural network controller for optimal trading with high-frequency data. To address the scarcity of training data in high-frequency trading, they pre-trained the deep neural network on simulated data to provide a solid foundation for fine-tuning on historical trading data.

        "The field of robotics often grapples with the complexities of motion planning, a search problem made challenging by the geometric and implicit nature of the configuration space (c-space).  Sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) algorithms address this by using random sampling and local extensions within the continuous c-space to find collision-free paths.  These algorithms often implicitly employ guided search, a concept we make explicit in this work.\n\nEarly SBMP algorithms, like Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) [23], demonstrated the effectiveness of exploration guided by Voronoi bias, particularly in environments without narrow passages.  Subsequent research often focused on navigating these challenging narrow passages [3, 28] or on optimizing path quality, such as maximizing clearance [16].  Due to the inherent complexity of motion planning, improvements frequently relied on environment-specific heuristics encoded by engineers.\n\nThis paper formalizes the previously implicit notion of guidance by defining guiding spaces and guided search. A guiding space is an auxiliary space used to estimate the value of exploring different configurations, informing the exploration strategy of our proposed general guided search algorithm.  This definition is inherently hierarchical, as any search space (including c-space itself) can serve as a guiding space.  Intuitively, guidance represents the bias introduced into the exploration process, analogous to the heuristic guidance used by A* in discrete search spaces, but applied within the continuous c-space.\n\nBy explicitly defining guiding spaces, we uncover the underlying guidance mechanisms within seemingly disparate existing methods.  These methods can be categorized into three main groups: robot modification, environment modification, and experience-based guidance. This perspective simplifies and clarifies the conceptual contributions of various algorithms, facilitating generalized implementations and their composition.\n\nFraming SBMP algorithms within this common language of guiding spaces enables a novel evaluation method focused on the quality of guidance.  We adopt an information-theoretic approach, where the guidance computation procedure provides information to the search process.  Experimental results across various algorithms and environments confirm the intuitive suitability of certain algorithms for specific c-space features.  Furthermore, this metric reveals algorithmic properties that traditional metrics like runtime or sample count often obscure.  By measuring guidance quality locally, we gain insights into the benefits of combining guiding spaces, demonstrated by a hybrid guiding space that outperforms its individual components.",
        "The advent of fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications in 2020 spurred global commercialization.  From 2G to 5G, communication frequency bands have increased from 100 MHz to the GHz range [1, 2], exploiting higher-frequency electromagnetic waves for greater spectral resources.  Further exploration of millimeter wave, terahertz, and optical communication is crucial for discovering new spectral resources [3\u20135].  While free-space optical (FSO) communication, visible light communication (VLC), and short-range near-infrared communication have been extensively studied and widely deployed, light waves are easily absorbed by opaque obstacles, limiting optical communication primarily to line-of-sight scenarios.  Moreover, higher-frequency signals like millimeter waves and terahertz waves increasingly exhibit characteristics similar to optical signals, such as narrow pulses and susceptibility to blockage [6\u20139], necessitating solutions to mitigate their impact on communication quality.\n\nReconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offer a novel approach.  These meta-surfaces programmably modulate passing electromagnetic waves [10\u201313].  Current microwave-band RIS structures primarily comprise arrays of digital coding units, enabling adjustment of incident beams to control the intensity, phase, frequency, and polarity of outgoing beams.  Di and Zhang [12] proposed using RIS for microwave beamforming, effectively mimicking a large-scale base station antenna array directed towards multiple nodes in free space.  This approach reduces the burden on the base station, improves energy efficiency, and allows for the recollection and retransmission of previously unreceived microwave signals.\n\nAnalogous to microwave RIS, optical RIS structures require the following functionalities: (1) Reflecting the incident beam; (2) Preserving the original beam's information with minimal alteration; (3) Programmably controlling the intensity, phase, frequency, polarization, and other characteristics of the outgoing beam; (4) Precisely adjusting the outgoing beam's direction to track the user.\n\nExisting technologies like spatial light modulators (SLMs) and optical micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) address these requirements [14\u201317].  Proposed in 1982 [16], two-dimensional magneto-optic SLMs adjust the amplitude, phase, polarization, and other parameters of transmitted light.  Combined with lens groups, SLMs reconstruct light fields with minimal power loss.  Comprising digital coding unit arrays, SLMs allow programmable adjustment of incident light amplitude and phase at modulation frequencies up to 100 Hz.  SLMs have been employed for signal modulation in low-speed VLC systems [18] and for converting single beams into multiple beams to track multiple mobile users [19]. Optical MEMS, comprising arrays of adjustable micro-lenses, offer cost-effective and readily manufacturable solutions for controlling reflected light direction, but lack the ability to freely control the phase, frequency, and polarization of the outgoing beam.\n\nLeveraging optical RIS, we propose a controllable multi-branch wireless optical communication system with RIS in the channels, termed an optical intelligent channel communication system.  By deploying multiple optical RIS, or intelligent channel reconfigurable nodes (ICRNs), we create multiple artificial optical channels, or intelligent channels.  The system's intelligence lies in its ability to: (1) Track mobile users by coordinating the transmitter and ICRNs to direct the signal towards the user's receiver center; (2) Establish multiple controllable channels between the base station and users, with adjustable paths via ICRN selection; (3) Provide the base station with knowledge of each channel's physical path, enabling real-time channel state information (CSI) estimation; (4) Optimize power efficiency by dynamically allocating power to each channel based on CSI, ensuring communication stability.\n\nThis paper analyzes the performance of this system, assuming accurate beam alignment with the receiver center.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Privacy Challenges in Machine Learning\n\n## Introduction and Background\n\nOver the past decade, machine learning algorithms based on (deep) neural architectures have led to a revolution in applications such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). While the abundance of training data has been crucial to this success, it presents significant privacy concerns since much of this data contains personal and sensitive information from individuals.\n\nFor example, natural language models for email reply suggestions and dialog systems rely on users' email data (Chen et al. [2019], Deb et al. [2019]). This creates privacy vulnerabilities, as models may generate outputs that reveal private information from the training set. Multiple studies have demonstrated successful membership inference attacks on deep learning models (Shokri et al. [2017], Carlini et al. [2019]).\n\n## The Privacy Challenge\n\nRecent research by Carlini et al. [2019] shows that \"unintended memorization\" in neural networks is both commonplace and difficult to prevent. This memorization:\n- Is not due to overtraining (Tetko et al. [1995], Carlini et al. [2019])\n- Cannot be prevented by standard techniques like early-stopping or dropout\n- Is actually necessary for some learning tasks (Feldman [2020])\n\n## Differential Privacy as a Solution\n\nTo address these privacy concerns, researchers have turned to differential privacy (DP), introduced by Dwork et al. [2006]. \n\nDefinition 1.1 ((\u03b5, \u03b4)-DP): An algorithm M is (\u03b5, \u03b4)-DP if for any two neighboring databases D, D' and any subset S of outputs:\n```\nPr[M(D) \u2208 S] \u2264 e\u03b5 Pr[M(D') \u2208 S] + \u03b4\n```\n\n## DP-SGD: Implementation and Challenges\n\nAbadi et al. [2016] introduced DP-SGD (differentially private stochastic gradient descent) for training deep learning models privately. The algorithm differs from standard SGD in two key ways:\n\n1. Gradient Clipping: Per-sample gradients are clipped to bound sensitivity\n2. Noise Addition: Carefully calibrated noise is added to ensure privacy\n\nWhile DP-SGD can achieve reasonable accuracy-vs-privacy tradeoffs, its adoption in real-world applications has been limited due to significant computational overhead.\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nSeveral strategies have been proposed to address DP-SGD's performance challenges:\n\n1. Microbatching\n   - Divides batches into microbatches for gradient clipping\n   - Offers speed improvements but may reduce accuracy\n\n2. Multiple Method\n   - Creates multiple model copies for parallel processing\n   - Memory-intensive and impractical for large models\n\n3. Outer Product Method\n   - Uses outer products between activations and backpropagated gradients\n   - Architecture-specific implementation required\n   - Higher memory requirements\n\n4. Compiler Optimization\n   - Leverages language primitives for faster implementation\n   - Framework-specific solution (JAX and TensorFlow)\n\nThis restructured version presents the information in a clear progression from problem introduction to proposed solutions, with appropriate section headings to guide the reader through the logical flow of ideas.",

Learning from humans is particularly desirable for safe interactive robot control, as learned policies are based on the demonstrator's behavior and require few training samples. However, a common issue affecting behavior cloning is limited variation in demonstration data, resulting in overly-specific, poorly generalized policies that lack robustness.\n\n## Core Challenges\n### Error Compounding and Data Quality\nLearned policies may be influenced by error compounding (also known as covariate shift), where a mismatch arises between training and testing data distributions. While stochastic perturbations (disturbance injections) can be added to augment the learning space and create stable policies, this approach assumes demonstrators are proficient and provide consistently high-quality demonstrations.\n\n### Real-world Complexity\nIn real-world scenarios, demonstration data is often heterogeneous and of varying quality due to:\n- Task difficulty\n- Human inexperience\n- Idiosyncratic behavior that may not be task-optimal\n- Unintentional drifting\n\nNa\u00efve application of disturbance injections in these scenarios fails to consider demonstration quality, leading to over-generalized policies.\n\n## Proposed Solution: Task Achievement Weighted Disturbance Injections (TAW-DI)\nTo address these challenges, this paper introduces TAW-DI, drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning to weight the contribution of demonstrations. The approach:\n\n1. Maximizes task achievement by selectively updating based on high-quality demonstrations\n2. Dissuades learning from poor demonstrations\n3. Utilizes weighted sub-optimal trajectories to accelerate policy performance convergence\n\n### Implementation Process\nThe method follows an iterative process:\n1. Generate disturbance-injected augmented trajectories to minimize task achievement weighted covariate shift\n2. Update the policy using task achievement weighted trajectories to concentrate around high-achievement spaces\n\n## Results\nEvaluation demonstrates that this framework successfully learns robust policies despite:\n- Limited variation in demonstrations\n- Diverse quality of demonstrations\n\nThe approach has been validated through robotic excavation tasks in both simulations and a scale excavator, outperforming methods that address these issues independently.",

As the industry anticipates significant expansion in the coming decades, it promises enhanced mobility for both passengers and cargo through increasingly diverse transportation methods. However, this growth brings mounting environmental concerns, which some experts consider the industry's most pressing challenge[1].\n\nThe environmental impact of aviation manifests in three critical areas:\n1. Local air quality degradation\n2. Climate change contribution\n3. Community noise pollution[2]\n\nWithout proper intervention, these environmental challenges risk intensifying air pollution, accelerating global warming, and exacerbating related issues. While dimensionality reduction offers a partial solution for some data-driven analyses, metric learning presents a more comprehensive approach. This machine learning subfield develops customized 'weighted' distance metrics for specific tasks, proving valuable wherever distance measurements between objects play a crucial role[24]. Though metric learning has successfully been applied in computer vision and bioinformatics, it remains underutilized in aviation and transportation research.\n\nThis study introduces metric learning to aircraft segmentation, enhancing our ability to assess environmental impacts. Our results demonstrate that learned distance metrics outperform baseline measurements while maintaining strong generalization capabilities.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. **Novel Metric Learning Solution**: We develop a comprehensive approach to aircraft segmentation for environmental impact assessment, encompassing:\n   - Representative aircraft selection\n   - Computer experimentation\n   - Constraint identification\n   - Metric learning implementation\n   - Evaluation methodologies (visual and quantitative)\n   This work serves as a pioneering benchmark for metric learning in aviation and transportation.\n\n2. **Statistical Innovation**: We introduce a new statistical method for identifying similar and dissimilar object pairs, essential for weakly-supervised metric learning algorithms.

        "Recently, large language models (LLMs)\u2014extensive deep learning models based on the transformer architecture\u2014have been introduced [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Notably, researchers from OpenAI were the first to present a commercial LLM, namely GPT-3.5, a large generative model pre-trained on natural language and source code. Similarly, Rozi\u00e8re et al. [2] from Meta introduced Code LLaMA, an open-source LLM based on the LLaMA-2 model [3] further trained with source code.\n\nPrior studies have experimented with various approaches to leverage LLMs, such as prompt engineering [6, 7, 8], few-shot learning [9, 10, 11], and model fine-tuning [12, 13, 14], for downstream tasks. For instance, Arora et al. [7] proposed a prompt design based on question-answering, which helps an open-source LLM outperform GPT-3, even when few-shot learning is employed. Another example, Brown et al. [9], conducted an empirical study on few-shot learning, applying it to LLMs for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Additionally, Chen et al. [14] conducted an experimental study, fine-tuning an LLM, specifically, GPT-3, on source code.",
        "Speech separation, addressing the \"cocktail party problem,\" aims to isolate target speech from background interference [1].  While conventional techniques include computational auditory scene analysis [2], non-negative matrix factorization [3, 4], HMM-GMM [5, 6], and minimum mean square error [7], deep learning has recently emerged as the dominant approach [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and is the focus of this paper.  Deep learning-based speech separation can be categorized into speaker-dependent [14], target-dependent, and speaker-independent approaches, based on prior knowledge of speaker information.  Speaker-dependent methods, requiring prior information for all speakers, have limited practical application. Current research primarily focuses on speaker-independent and target-dependent techniques.\n\nSpeaker-independent methods face a speaker permutation ambiguity problem.  Two primary solutions exist: deep clustering [15, 16, 17], which projects time-frequency units into higher-dimensional embedding vectors for clustering; and permutation invariant training [18, 19, 20], which selects the speaker permutation with the minimum training error.\n\nTarget-dependent methods leverage prior knowledge of the target speaker. Early methods trained a model for each target speaker [21], limiting practicality. Speaker extraction methods address this by incorporating speaker codes from a speaker recognition system as network input [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].  For example, [29] uses a context adaptive deep neural network with a speaker adaptation layer, while [23] proposes a temporal spectrum approximation loss for phase-sensitive mask estimation.  [30] extends end-to-end speaker-independent separation [31] to speaker extraction.\n\nThese methods, primarily single-channel, perform well in clean environments but struggle with reverberation.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nEstimating and interpolating acoustic fields from discrete microphone measurements are fundamental challenges in acoustic signal processing. These estimations have diverse applications, including acoustic field visualization [1], room impulse response interpolation [2, 3], sound source identification [4, 5], sound field capture for spatial audio [6-8], and spatial active noise control [9, 10]. Our focus lies on sound field estimation within source-free regions.\n\nTraditional sound field estimation typically involves decomposing measurements into spatial Fourier basis functions [11], such as plane waves [7] or spherical harmonics [12, 13]. This approach, however, requires empirical determination of both truncation order and expansion center for basis expansion. While sparsity-based approaches using these basis functions have been extensively studied [14, 15] to enhance spatial resolution, they introduce a significant limitation: the inference operator of expansion coefficients becomes nonlinear, necessitating iterative processing for estimation.\n\nAn alternative approach, proposed in [16], introduces infinite-dimensional sound field analysis, which corresponds to kernel ridge regression when estimating pressure fields with pressure microphones [17]. This method eliminates the need for empirical parameter settings and enables linear estimation operations. Further developments in [18, 19] introduced kernel functions incorporating prior information on source directions. This directionally weighted kernel demonstrates superior estimation accuracy compared to methods without prior source direction information [17, 20].\n\nThe directionally weighted kernel function incorporates two parameters derived from the von Mises-Fisher distribution [21]: prior source directions and weighting spread. While these parameters were empirically determined in previous studies [18, 19], source directions are often unavailable in practical applications. Additionally, determining the optimal spread parameter presents significant challenges.\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing directional kernel function parameters using microphone measurements. Our approach simplifies the problem by discretizing parameters and expressing the kernel function as a weighted sum of sub-kernels, resulting in an optimization problem analogous to multiple kernel learning [22, 23]. We explore two types of regularizations for the weighting parameter to develop a solution algorithm. Although kernel function optimization requires iterative processing, the estimation process remains a linear operation.",
        "Federated Learning (FL) [35] allows a set of clients to collaboratively solve a machine learning problem coordinated by a central server.  Clients retain their data locally for privacy, sharing only model parameters periodically.  While existing research addresses FL challenges like user privacy [35, 39, 53], communication cost [17, 21, 31, 50, 55], and data heterogeneity [5, 13, 20, 29, 54], a critical issue remains largely unexplored: the impact of noisy labels in user data.  Manual annotation often introduces incorrect labels, which existing FL algorithms like FedAvg [35] fail to account for, treating all samples equally.  This leads to overfitting on noisy labels and poor generalization performance.  Developing robust algorithms is challenging because data privacy prevents the server from directly verifying label quality.  While recent approaches [8, 52, 59] utilize clean validation sets, this paper introduces a novel approach, formally framing the noisy label problem as a bilevel optimization problem and providing two efficient algorithms with guaranteed convergence.\n\nOur approach identifies noisy labels based on their contribution to training, measured using a Shapley value-inspired [46] approach.  For each sample \ud835\udc60 in dataset D, we compare the generalization performance of a model trained on subset S \u2282 D/{\ud835\udc60} to a model trained on \ud835\udc46 \u222a {\ud835\udc60}.  The difference reflects label quality: correct labels improve generalization, while mislabeled samples hinder it.  The Shapley value, averaging this difference over all possible subsets S, quantifies a sample's contribution.  However, its NP-hard computation necessitates an alternative.  We introduce sample weights, transforming the problem into finding optimal weights for generalization performance.  This results in a bilevel optimization problem [44, 48, 56] with inner and outer problem levels.  While efficient gradient-based algorithms [15, 18, 26] exist for non-distributed bilevel problems, efficient FL-specific solutions remain unexplored. The key challenge lies in evaluating the hypergradient (gradient with respect to the outer problem variable) in the FL setting.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nOver the past several decades, the rise of big data and machine learning workloads has spawned massive data-driven applications. These applications\u2014including large language models [1], intrusion detection systems [2], and graph processing frameworks [3], [4]\u2014consume and generate data at unprecedented rates, requiring storage capacity in terabytes (TB) and memory bandwidths of TB/s. Conventional electronic memory technologies, particularly dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), struggle to meet these escalating bandwidth [6] and energy efficiency [7] demands. Moreover, DRAM technology faces significant challenges in scaling toward the 10-nm technology node. Current DRAM nodes, such as Micron's 1\u03b1 and 1\u03b2, are fabricated at 12-14 nm. At lower node scales, research has shown that DRAM cells suffer from diminished charge retention, deteriorating structural integrity, and dramatically increased delay and power penalties in bit lines [6]. While 3D-stacking technologies and through-silicon vias have enabled high bandwidth memory (HBM), the growing demand for capacity, throughput, and energy efficiency necessitates exploring new main memory technologies.\n\nNon-volatile memories (NVMs) address DRAM's data retention challenges by eliminating the need for refreshes and associated latency concerns. However, NVM candidates based on ferroelectric (FRAM) [8] and resistive metal oxide (RRAM) [9] technologies typically face reliability and write endurance issues. Phase change materials (PCMs) offer a promising alternative, providing higher reliability while maintaining NVM advantages [10]-[12]. PCM cells demonstrate superior energy efficiency, bit densities, and bandwidth compared to other NVM cell types [13], [14]. These cells operate by transitioning between two material states: amorphous and crystalline. The high resistance contrast between these states enables data storage through resistance levels. In electrically controlled PCM (EPCM) cells, current pulses facilitate phase transitions. By controlling the state transition between amorphous and crystalline phases, different crystallization levels can be achieved, enabling multi-level cells (MLCs).",
        "Autonomous navigation has seen remarkable advancements, evident in the rise of self-driving cars and delivery robots.  However, significant challenges remain.  Classical planning methods, utilizing analytic optimization and reactive rules [1]-[3], offer safety and interpretability but often result in unnatural and inefficient behaviors with poor social norm compliance [4].  Conversely, machine learning approaches leveraging imitation learning [5], [6] and deep reinforcement learning [7]-[11] can capture nuanced human actions and improve environmental awareness.  However, these methods require extensive datasets, lack safety guarantees [12], and suffer from limited interpretability and transparency [13], leading to unpredictable failures [14], [15].\n\nThis work addresses these limitations by combining the strengths of classical and learning-based methods.  We introduce a sample-efficient learning strategy to enhance classical planners and a fallback system with a trained supervisor for guaranteed safety. Our approach offers a general framework for using learning to improve classical algorithms while retaining their advantages.\n\nSpecifically, we propose the following: 1) Train a planner using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with policy guidance from a classical planner.  This involves seeding the replay buffer with classical planner experiences and regularizing the actor in an actor-critic algorithm using the classical planner's policy. 2) Implement a classical rule-based navigation policy as a fallback and train a supervisor for minimal switching between the neural and classical planners to ensure safety.\n\nThis approach leverages existing classical algorithms for faster, improved convergence and uses a regularization term for stability and transparency, keeping the learning process close to the well-understood classical algorithm.  Furthermore, unlike methods relying on human demonstrations, ours requires no human involvement, as this is implicitly present in the classical algorithm's formulation and the reward function.\n\nOur main contribution is this combined approach, resulting in a sample-efficient learning strategy and a safety-guaranteed fallback mechanism.  While focusing on navigation planning, our methodology provides a broader recipe for integrating learning with classical algorithms.  The supervisor level ensures safety and transparency.\n\nRelevant code and videos are available at https://github.com/eliasgoldsztejn95. *(This work was supported by ISF Grant 1651/19, the Helmsley Charitable Trust through the ABC Robotics Center of Ben-Gurion University, and the Lynn and William Frankel Center for Computer Science.

        "The notion of using a computer as a musical instrument is not readily embraced by many computer music practitioners. In this report, we explore the challenges associated with perceiving the computer as a musical instrument and investigate potential solutions. At the outset, it is beneficial to consider the unique features that computer technology brings to musical instrumentation.\n\nTraditional acoustic instruments, such as strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion, involve direct physical interaction with the sound production mechanism. Strings are plucked or bowed, tubes are blown, and surfaces are struck, with the performer\u2019s gesture directly exciting the acoustic mechanism. Instruments like the piano and organ mediate this connection through mechanical linkages or electrical connections, yet they still follow a \"one gesture to one acoustic event\" paradigm. \n\nIn contrast, when sensors capture gestures and computing elements generate sound, a vast array of possibilities emerges. Unfortunately, the electronic music instrument industry often adheres to traditional paradigms, particularly with standard keyboard controllers. Musical instruments and their gestural interfaces become widely used for various reasons, many of which are social in nature, such as the development of a repertoire. However, such sociological aspects are beyond the scope of this paper. Our focus will be on factors like ease of use, skill development potential, reactive behavior, and the coherence of the cognitive model for control.\n\nA conceptual framework for controller research and development is presented in the figure below. A human performer aims to produce a specific musical result, communicating intentions to the body's sensorimotor system (or \"motor program\"). Parameters are sensed at the gestural interface and passed to controller software, which conditions, tracks, and maps them to algorithms generating the musical material. Although schematic and incomplete, this framework offers insight into the roles of human motor learning, controller mapping, and generative software as a unified adaptive system.\n\nUnlike the one gesture to one acoustic event paradigm, our framework allows generative algorithms to create complex musical structures comprising many events.",
        "Studies on online social networks have been instrumental in understanding global social characteristics, such as human connections and behaviors. Many studies, including [1] - [5], have explored the structural properties of social graphs, where nodes represent users and edges signify friendships in online networks. Typically, researchers rely on sampling methods to analyze these graphs since complete graph data is often inaccessible to third-party researchers. Effective sampling techniques, such as breadth-first search and random walk, allow for the traversal of neighbor data, which can be obtained by querying users [1] - [3], [6] - [9].\n\nGjoka et al. introduced a framework known as re-weighted random walk to derive unbiased estimates of the structural properties of social graphs through random walks [7], [9]. This framework mitigates the sampling bias toward high-degree nodes usually induced by crawling methods. The process involves performing a random walk on the graph, selecting neighbors uniformly and randomly to generate a sequence of sampled nodes. These nodes are then re-weighted to adjust for the sampling bias inherent in the sequence's Markov property. The number of available queries during practical sampling periods is generally limited [10] - [12]. Consequently, several algorithms have been developed to estimate structural properties using minimal queries within this framework [10], [11], [13] - [20].\n\nHowever, the re-weighted random walk framework primarily facilitates local structural property estimation. It necessitates sampling most graph data to correct the sampling bias when estimating global structural properties, like shortest-path metrics. Additionally, the re-weighted sample means alone do not sufficiently predict the original graph's structure, such as its visual representation. Analysts' interests in social network characteristics vary and include local structural properties (e.g., degree distribution, clustering coefficient), global structural properties (e.g., shortest-path lengths, betweenness centrality), and visual graph representations [21].\n\nTo bridge this gap, we investigate the social graph restoration problem: Given a small social graph sample acquired through crawling, our objective is to generate a graph that mirrors the original graph's structural properties as closely as possible. This generated graph should allow us to estimate both local and global structural properties and anticipate the original graph's visual representation. Current approaches to this problem include subgraph sampling [1] - [3], [6], [8], [22] - [24] and the method proposed by Gjoka et al. [15]. Subgraph sampling involves creating a subgraph from a set of edges obtained through a crawling method, presuming it to be a representative sample of the original graph. Conversely, Gjoka et al.'s method aims to generate a graph that retains estimates of local structural properties achieved through re-weighted random walk, with the goal of replicating the original graph's structural properties, even those not explicitly preserved.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new method to restore the original social graph from a small sample obtained by random walk. Our method generates a graph that preserves local structural properties' estimates and the subgraph structure sampled by random walk. Initially, we construct a subgraph from the edges captured during a random walk and estimate local structural properties using the re-weighted random walk.",
        "Borges' famous short story, Funes the Memorious, describes a fictional character, Ireneo Funes, who has an extraordinary capacity to remember things and events (Borges, 1962). Funes' exceptional feats of memory, as recounted by Borges, inspire a sense of awe and fascination in us partly because they make us viscerally aware of the inferiority of our own capacity to remember in comparison.\n\nThe memory capacity of an average human being is, of course, nowhere near as impressive as that of Funes, yet experiments repeatedly suggest that it may still be surprisingly large and that we may often be subjectively underestimating our own capacity to remember things (Shepard, 1967; Standing, 1973; Hollingworth, 2004). For example, in a classic study, Lionel Standing showed that humans could recognize with high accuracy 10,000 pictures they were shown only once a few days prior to a recognition test (Standing, 1973). In a more recent follow-up study, Brady et al. (2008) showed that these long-term visual memories may be remarkably detailed, fine-grained memories.\n\nHow would our current machine learning models fare in their ability to incorporate and retain new visual information in a head-to-head comparison with humans? Would they already perform at super-human levels, a bit like real-world artificial versions of Ireneo Funes, or would they fall significantly short of the efficiency of human memory to incorporate new visual information? In current deep learning practice, the primary mode of incorporating new information into a model is through gradient descent in the model's parameter space (other less standard ways of incorporating information into a deep learning model are discussed in the Discussion section below). In this paper, we ask if deep learning via gradient descent can match the efficiency of human long-term memory to incorporate new visual information in a rigorous, head-to-head, quantitative comparison.\n\nAn answer to this question would be highly informative for a few reasons: (1) if current deep learning models turn out to be inferior to humans, we can aim for human-level memory efficiency as a feasible performance target for our models (similar to aiming for human-level Go playing, human-level machine translation, or human-level speech recognition); (2) if we find that deep learning models can in principle match human memory efficiency but only with much greater sample size requirements (e.g. only after pretraining them with ultra-large datasets), this can motivate us to improve the sample efficiency of our models relative to humans; (3) in the case of either (1) or (2), a better understanding and appreciation of how humans achieve high memory efficiency with low sample complexity can give us ideas or hints about how to improve our models in these respects.\n\nOur results suggest that deep learning via gradient descent, as currently practiced, cannot match human memory efficiency when subjected to the same visual recognition memory experiment as in Brady et al. (2008). We find that even in the best case, deep learning models require roughly 10 exposures to the same visual stimuli in order to reach a recognition memory performance that humans achieve after a single exposure. Prior knowledge induced through pretraining and larger model sizes improve the model performance; however, these improvements are usually not apparent after a single exposure, requiring at least a few exposures to begin to show their effects. This suggests that simply scaling up the pretraining dataset size or the model size may not be a feasible strategy to reach human-level memory efficiency, pointing instead to the importance of algorithmic improvements to achieve this goal. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of earlier studies both in deep learning and in human memory research.\n\nWe, at one glance, can perceive three glasses on a table; Funes, all the leaves and tendrils and fruit that make up a grapevine.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow:\n\n# Controlling Dialogue Acts in Natural Language Generation\n\n## Introduction\nDialogue systems must faithfully produce utterances that realize multiple types of dialogue acts (DAs), such as providing opinions, making recommendations, or requesting information. While natural language generators (NLGs) have traditionally been trained on large parallel corpora mapping domain-specific meaning representations to output utterances, recent work shows that pretrained language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for controllable NLG using prompt-based learning (PBL).\n\n## Background and Motivation\nPrevious work on semantically-controlled NLG has focused primarily on improving semantic accuracy. However, the same semantic attributes can be realized through different DAs (e.g., give_opinion, recommend, inform), each affecting the dialogue state differently. While NLG needs to faithfully realize both the DA and semantic attributes, previous work has neither controlled for nor evaluated DA accuracy.\n\nThis gap likely exists because many common NLG training sets (E2E, Weather, WebNLG, WikiBio, DART, ToTTo) only include inform DAs. In contrast, spoken dialogue datasets contain multiple DA types:\n- ViGGO corpus: 9 DAs\n- RNNLG corpus: 13 DAs\n- Multi-WOZ: 34 DAs\n- Topical Chat: 11 DAs\n\n## Novel Approach\nWe present a novel few-shot overgenerate-and-rank approach for controlled generation of DAs, with the following key contributions:\n\n1. First demonstration of DA control using PBL\n2. New overgenerate-and-rank framework for real-time DA accuracy evaluation\n3. Systematic exploration of ranking functions combining domain-specific and general measures\n4. Evidence that prioritizing DA correctness improves semantic accuracy\n5. Novel textual DA representations supporting automatic semantic accuracy ranking\n6. Systematic evaluation of 8 prompt formats across 4 LLMs\n\n## Results and Impact\nOur approach achieves remarkable results with minimal training:\n- Perfect DA accuracy and up to 99.81% semantic accuracy using only 10 examples\n- Significantly outperforms 100-shot per DA fine-tuning (97.7% semantic accuracy, 80.6% DA accuracy)\n- Shows significant performance variations across prompt styles\n\nThe framework incorporates:\n- High-accuracy DA classifiers for three domains\n- 6 ranking functions combining DA probability estimates with semantic accuracy measures\n- Various prompt formats, including novel approaches treating DA control as textual style transfer\n- Comprehensive testing of prompt sampling methods and DA representations\n\nThis restructured version presents a clearer progression from problem statement through solution approach to results, while maintaining all the original information in a more logically connected flow.",
        "Time-series (TS) data are prevalent across various fields, including public health (Adhikari et al., 2019), finance (Deb et al., 2017), and energy (Tay and Cao, 2001). Time-series forecasting (TSF), a crucial aspect of TS data analysis, aims to predict future events or trends based on historical data. Recent advancements in large Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), also known as foundation models, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven to be effective for TSF tasks. This effectiveness is achieved either by training TS foundation models from scratch (Yeh et al., 2023; Kamarthi and Prakash, 2023; Garza and Mergenthaler-Canseco, 2023; Das et al., 2023) or by adapting LLMs to TS data as natural language modalities (Jin et al., 2023; Chang et al., 2023; Xue and Salim, 2023; Gruver et al., 2023). These methods leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of PTMs or LLMs, showcasing effectiveness in zero-shot (Gruver et al., 2023) and LSTPrompt TSF tasks, offering promising applications without the need for domain-specific training data.\n\nCreating appropriate prompting techniques for zero-shot TSF tasks provides significant advantages, eliminating the necessity to train models from scratch or fine-tune LLMs for computational efficiency, all while maintaining forecasting accuracy. Current approaches (Xue and Salim, 2023; Gruver et al., 2023) prompt LLMs for zero-shot TSF tasks by aligning TS data with natural language sequences, prompting LLMs to perform TSF as sequence completion tasks. However, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of TS data and the complex forecasting mechanisms inherent in TSF, such as modeling temporal dependencies, which cannot be adequately captured by simple sequence completion tasks.\n\nTo address this limitation, we introduce LST-Prompt, a novel prompt strategy for LLMs in TSF tasks, offering TSF-oriented guidelines. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n- We propose Long-Short-Term Prompt (LST-Prompt), which breaks TSF down into short-term and long-term forecasting subtasks, each guiding LLMs with distinct forecasting rules and mechanisms, forming a Chain-of-Thought reasoning path for predictions.\n- We introduce TimeBreath to LSTPrompt, an innovative component that encourages LLMs to regularly revisit forecasting mechanisms, enabling the utilization of different forecasting mechanisms for various time periods.\n- We evaluate LSTPrompt across multiple benchmark and concurrent datasets, showcasing its effectiveness for zero-shot TSF tasks, and demonstrating its ability to outperform non-zero-shot methods in specific scenarios.",
        "In the real world, manipulators must adapt to the dynamic environment they operate in. This requires the ability to navigate obstacles and respond to changes effectively. Dynamic obstacle avoidance is crucial for manipulators to function robustly, especially in cluttered and dynamic environments. The primary challenge lies in getting a manipulator's end-effector from one point to another.\n\nCurrent obstacle avoidance methods have focused on open-loop motion planning, which involves computing a sequence of joint coordinates that are then converted to joint velocities during runtime. However, a more reactive approach directly works with joint velocities to avoid non-stationary obstacles. This approach, known as resolved-rate motion control (RRMC), is cost-effective, easily computable, and highly reactive.\n\nDifferential kinematics play a key role in developing reactive controllers for obstacle avoidance. By considering the rate of change of distance between the robot and obstacles, controllers can steer the manipulator away from collisions. To address over-constrained scenarios, strategies such as utilizing kinematically redundant manipulators or introducing intentional errors in the path trajectory can be employed.\n\nMaximizing manipulability, which measures a robot's ability to achieve arbitrary velocities, is crucial for enhancing robot performance and obstacle avoidance while reducing the risk of singularity issues. By incorporating manipulability optimization into reactive motion control, manipulators can adapt to volatile environments more effectively.\n\nReactive motion control offers a real-time solution for navigating obstacles, avoiding joint limits, and maximizing manipulability without the need for extensive preplanning. The proposed controller in this paper aims to achieve these goals for both stationary and moving obstacles, making it suitable for a wide range of robotic applications.\n\nIncorporating the principles of differential kinematics, manipulability maximization, and obstacle avoidance into a quadratic programming (QP) framework, the NEO controller presented in this paper offers a comprehensive solution for real-time robot motion control. The paper also includes experimental validation in simulation and on a physical robot, along with an open-source Python library for implementing the controller on various manipulators. The subsequent sections detail the methodology, development, and experimental results of the NEO controller, showcasing its effectiveness in challenging and dynamic environments.",
        "The depth of understanding the evolution of scientific topics arguably determines humanity's ability to advance scientific development and achieve groundbreaking results [20, 21].  This understanding is crucial for effective resource allocation [2, 13], researcher hiring [14, 19], and strategic direction selection [5, 12]. Governments need to identify promising scientific topics to efficiently allocate trillions in research funding [1]. Research institutions must evaluate the potential of a candidate's research area to maximize recruitment benefits.  Individual researchers need to prioritize promising topics to publish impactful work.  However, due to a lack of intuitive and in-depth understanding of scientific topics, their evolutionary laws remain largely unknown.  We propose a \"Scientific X-ray\" framework to address this gap and provide insights into the evolution of scientific topics.\n\nThe explosion of scientific data [1, 2, 3, 4] has fueled interest in data-driven methods to understand scientific evolution [5].  This growth, however, prompts questions about the long-term trajectory of scientific progress.  Futurist Raymond Kurzweil predicts a \"technological singularity\" by 2045, a point where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, potentially hindering further human-driven advancement [6].  Similarly, Moore's Law, which has driven exponential growth in computing power, is slowing as chip miniaturization approaches its physical limits [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].  This slowdown, coupled with the concept of the singularity, raises a critical question: does scientific evolution follow a similar life cycle of prosperity and decline [12, 13, 14]?\n\nOur research, analyzing citation trends of 68,675 high-impact publications (citation \u2265 1000, covering 16 disciplines, published from 1800 to 2019), suggests a potential answer.  We observed two dominant processes influencing publication impact: \"birth\" and \"aging\" (Fig. 1).  The \"aging\" phenomenon indicates that even highly influential topics eventually lose momentum and cease to develop further, despite their initial impact.\n\nFigure 1: Statistics on the \"birth\" and \"aging\" of 68,675 high-impact papers. The bar height represents the cumulative number of high-impact articles \"born\" up to a specific time. The dark blue portion represents the cumulative number \"aged\" by that time. \"Aging\" is defined as having no more than 10 new citations annually after a certain year. The light blue portion represents currently active articles.  This figure demonstrates that while high-impact articles continually emerge, some inevitably lose attention over time.\n\nWhile current citation-based metrics [15, 16, 17, 18] offer some insight into the impact evolution of individual publications, they are insufficient for understanding the complex evolution of scientific topics.",
        "Termination analysis, a classic problem in computability theory, aims to determine whether a program will halt.  Its importance is underscored by applications like software testing, where non-termination leads to infinite executions.  As Turing proved in 1936, no general algorithm can solve the termination problem for all program-input pairs [60].  While extensive research exists on termination analysis, most approaches rely on formal symbolic reasoning [15, 22, 23, 25, 33, 36].\n\nRecent efforts have explored using neural networks to estimate termination behavior.  For example, Giacobbe et al. [29] trained neural networks as ranking functions, mapping the program's state space to well-ordered sets.  Similarly, Abate et al. [3] used a neural network to fit ranking supermartingales over execution traces.  These approaches, aiming for formal guarantees, leverage satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers to validate their results.  However, they inherit limitations inherent to formal symbolic methods, such as the need to translate programs into symbolic representations and the potential for undecidable logical fragments or reliance on additional program invariants.\n\nThis paper departs from formal methods, embracing the stochastic nature of machine learning models.  Instead of seeking rigorous formal guarantees, we aim to estimate a program's termination behavior and localize potential non-termination causes for debugging.  This work also explores the applicability of machine learning techniques from other domains to program analysis.  Specifically, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [66] and Graph Attention Networks (GANs) [61], as detailed below.\n\nUnlike previous work focusing on execution traces, we analyze source code, assuming it contains patterns indicative of termination behavior.  Mirroring traditional program analysis techniques, we operate on graph representations of programs.  We leverage GNNs, a class of neural networks designed for graph-structured data analysis, which have gained traction in diverse fields like social network analysis [65], physical systems modeling [53], knowledge graph analysis [34], and point-cloud classification [71].  GNNs have also recently been applied to program analysis tasks such as variable misuse detection, type inference [7], and self-supervised bug detection and repair [9].\n\nInspired by [7, 9], we use GNNs to estimate program termination. Our baseline classifier employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [40].  However, simply estimating termination behavior provides limited debugging assistance.  Ideally, we want to pinpoint the likely root cause of non-termination, similar to fault localization techniques that rank potential causes of failure based on failing and passing test cases [41].\n\nWe explore attention and semantic segmentation mechanisms from machine learning, a novel application in the context of program analysis.  Attention, mimicking cognitive attention, highlights relevant parts of the input data.  We use attention to identify instructions influential in termination estimation, visualizing the program sections the network focuses on.  We implement a second termination classifier based on the Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture [61], anticipating improved classification compared to the GCN baseline due to the varying influence of instructions on termination.\n\nFor localizing non-termination causes, we employ semantic segmentation, typically used in image recognition to label each pixel with a class.  We apply this principle to programs, identifying statements causing non-termination.  Furthermore, we demonstrate how semantic segmentation information can be combined with program slicing to extract a non-terminating slice from the original program, simplifying debugging.\n\nOur experimental evaluation on various datasets, including custom datasets and benchmarks from software verification competitions, demonstrates strong generalization capabilities of our learned models.\n\nIn summary, this research contributes:\n\n* A GCN-based architecture for binary classification of program termination.\n* A GAT-based architecture that improves termination classification using self-attention and visualizes relevant nodes.\n* A semantic segmentation GAT that localizes nodes causing non-termination, specifically outermost infinite loops, and illustrates how this information can be used with program slicing for debugging.\n* Datasets for both classification and segmentation of program termination.",
        "Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) have garnered significant attention in both academia and industry for their crucial role in real-world applications, such as recommending movies on Netflix and products on Amazon. These systems model users' historical interactions to suggest items of potential interest. The effectiveness of SRSs largely depends on user engagement with the platform, which is often gauged through immediate feedback, such as clicks and likes. However, immediate feedback does not fully capture users' preferences. For instance, items with appealing titles and covers but poor-quality content might attract clicks but ultimately erode users' trust in the platform. Therefore, optimizing long-term user engagement, such as user retention, which better reflects user satisfaction, is essential.\n\nReinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing long-term metrics like user retention. While RL can model and explore dynamic user interests, existing RL-based SRSs face significant challenges, particularly with offline learning. Unlike gaming scenarios, where RL agents excel through trial-and-error methods, training RL models from scratch in online SRSs is risky due to the potential loss of users from inappropriate recommendations. Consequently, recent efforts have focused on offline RL-based SRSs. However, implementing offline RL has proven difficult for both value-based and policy-based methods. For value-based methods, instability issues, known as the 'Deadly Triad,' have prompted a shift towards model-based approaches. Yet, the vast state space in recommendation scenarios complicates transition probability estimation, leading to subpar performance. For policy-based methods, the unbounded variance in counterfactual policy evaluation has pushed the community to clip or discard counterfactual weights, which can result in inaccurate evaluations and hinder performance.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose optimizing user retention recommendations using Decision Transformer (DT), which frames offline RL as an autoregressive problem, thereby overcoming offline learning hurdles. Specifically, DT generates recommendations based on a specified reward, such as user retention and state. When conditioned on an optimal reward, DT can predict future actions that yield the desired outcome during the recommendation process. Although promising, applying DT in SRSs is complex due to several challenges: (1) Reward modeling deficiency\u2014rewards are crucial in DT, and converting them into embeddings can neglect their inherent order, affecting training quality. (2) Discrepancy in recommendation generation\u2014recommendations are made based on maximum rewards, which may not align with the diverse rewards encountered during training, limiting the model's ability to utilize data with smaller rewards. (3) Unreliable performance evaluation\u2014despite addressing offline learning issues, DT still requires importance-weighted offline evaluation to assess policy performance, which can lead to unbounded variance and unreliable results.\n\nTo address these issues, we introduce a novel framework, DT4Rec, which deploys Decision Transformer for recommendations. We enhance reward embedding by auto-weighted aggregating meta-embeddings derived from discretized reward values, preserving the partial order among rewards. We also employ weighted contrastive learning to resolve the inference-training discrepancy by leveraging smaller reward samples through contrasting with larger reward samples. Furthermore, we propose two new reliable metrics: the model-based and similarity-based user retention scores, which offer a more stable performance evaluation compared to off-policy evaluation methods.",
        "The increasing utilization of microservice-based applications, Systems-of-Systems (SoS), and Internet-of-Things (IoT) services underscores the critical need for effective and highly dynamic monitoring to ensure seamless operations amidst escalating complexity. While applications can typically be augmented with monitoring functionalities using code instrumentation techniques (e.g., Kieker Framework, Open-Telemetry, Prometheus client libraries), this may not always be feasible, particularly in cases involving legacy or third-party systems where monitoring tasks necessitate the use of external probes.\n\nCutting-edge monitoring systems employing external probes are capable of adapting to changes by executing costly probe-level operations, such as redeploying or reconfiguring probes, to accommodate alterations in data collection strategies. For example, modifying the set of collected metrics or adjusting the sampling rate of data collection via Prometheus and its exporters requires updating the Prometheus configuration to alter the sampling rate, updating the exporter configuration to adjust the collected metrics, and, at the very least, restarting the exporter when Prometheus is appropriately configured for hot reload via an HTTP API request.\n\nThis poster paper introduces a hierarchical architecture that can be utilized to create reconfigurable and adaptive monitoring probes, enabling swift changes to configuration settings, ingestion services, data collection and analysis logic, without the need for costly probe redeployment. The class of adaptive probes, termed ReProbes, described in this paper, enhance probing systems with efficient, probe-level, self-adaptive behaviors, specifically, adaptive behaviors localized to the components responsible for data collection, as opposed to solutions aimed at facilitating probe (un)deployment. The proposed architecture leverages the plug-in architectural pattern to achieve the desired level of flexibility, and the initial, qualitative evaluation demonstrates the capability of the ReProbe to effectively handle dynamic monitoring scenarios, providing the necessary, flexible adaptivity.",

These are maliciously modified inputs that appear nearly identical to legitimate inputs to human observers but cause misclassification by DNN models. This vulnerability poses a significant obstacle to deploying deep learning systems in safety-critical and mission-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and financial services.\n\n## Types of Adversarial Attacks\n\n### White-Box Attacks\nIn white-box scenarios, attackers have complete access to the target model, including its:\n- Internal architecture\n- Weights\n- Parameters\n\nThis access allows attackers to directly compute adversarial examples as an optimization problem. While this model assumes a significant security breach or insider threat, both security and ML communities have made continuous advances in attacks and defenses under this setting.\n\n### Black-Box Attacks\nBlack-box attacks represent a more realistic threat model, where attackers can only interact with models through query interfaces (e.g., ML-as-a-service platforms). These attacks fall into two categories:\n\n1. **Query-based attacks**: Attackers iteratively adapt inputs based on model responses until producing successful adversarial examples.\n\n2. **Substitute model attacks**: Attackers query the target model to train a local substitute, then transfer adversarial examples from the substitute to the target.\n\n## Introducing Blacklight: A Novel Defense System\n\n### Core Insight\nQuery-based black-box attacks rely on iterative optimization, producing highly similar queries in the input space. Blacklight leverages this pattern to detect attacks through efficient content-similarity analysis.\n\n### Key Features\n- Account-oblivious detection\n- Highly scalable and lightweight\n- Uses probabilistic fingerprints for query detection\n- Secure one-way hashes prevent fingerprint manipulation\n\n### Experimental Results\nBlacklight demonstrates impressive effectiveness:\n- Detects all tested attacks within 2-9 queries\n- Captures >90% of attack queries (except Boundary attacks)\n- Reduces attack success rate to 0% across all eight tested attacks\n- Performs well against adaptive countermeasures\n\n## Key Contributions",
        "3D multi-object tracking, crucial for autonomous driving systems, provides essential data for perception, prediction, and planning modules.  LiDAR, the predominant sensor for environment perception in self-driving vehicles, has led to increased interest in tracking within LiDAR point clouds.\n\nMulti-object tracking, a well-established task in computer vision, has been extensively explored in image sequences.  The prevalent tracking-by-detection paradigm detects objects frame-by-frame, then associates them across frames, often formulating this association as a bipartite matching problem focusing on the affinity matrix between tracked objects and new detections. Motion and appearance cues typically inform this matching criteria.\n\nThis tracking-by-detection pipeline also dominates 3D LiDAR tracking.  Current methods rely on a heuristic matching step to link detected objects over time, employing numerous hand-crafted rules for matching criteria, thresholds for each object class, and track life management (handling new and disappearing objects). These rules, often based on an object's continuous presence for a set number of frames, are not trainable, heavily reliant on hyper-parameters, data-dependent, and difficult to generalize across scenarios.\n\nThe need for this heuristic matching step stems from the lack of inter-frame connection during object detection. While some methods estimate velocity or predict object location in consecutive frames, they use these predictions for matching rather than final output, considering only location and not association confidence. Consequently, they are susceptible to spurious detections and require manual handling of occluded objects.  Existing online tracking systems also necessitate re-detection and matching to differentiate new objects from tracked ones.\n\nTo address these limitations, we introduce SimTrack, a simplified 3D multi-object tracking model for point clouds, eliminating the heuristic matching step. Compatible with common pillar or voxel-based 3D object detection networks, SimTrack employs a novel hybrid-time centerness map representing objects by their first-appear locations within a given input period. This map directly links detections to previously tracked objects, inherently providing inter-frame association confidence.  A motion updating branch estimates tracked object motion, updating their positions from their first appearance. New and disappearing objects are handled through confidence thresholding on the same map, eliminating manual track life management.  As illustrated in Figure 1 (not included in the provided text), SimTrack unifies tracked object linking, new object detection, and dead track handling within a single forward pass.\n\nThis work presents the first learning paradigm to eliminate the heuristic matching step in 3D LiDAR point cloud tracking, significantly simplifying the system.  Our end-to-end trainable model performs joint detection and tracking through the hybrid-time centerness map and motion updating branch.  Experimental results demonstrate its competitive performance.

        "Autonomous driving (AD) is a long-researched area with numerous novel motion planning algorithms proposed. Despite these advancements, AD continues to present significant challenges. Traditional motion planning algorithms typically rely on rule- or optimization-based methods. However, these manually designed rules or models often contain inaccurate assumptions, limiting their scalability to complex real-world scenarios such as overtaking, roundabouts, interactions, and merging. This limitation has driven the exploration of learning-based approaches, promising the automatic learning of complex driving policies through data. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is at the forefront of these approaches, combining the perception abilities of deep neural networks (DNN) with the decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL), and has been widely investigated for AD tasks.\n\nDRL has been successfully applied to various sequential decision-making problems. In the context of AD, a DRL-augmented system processes inputs such as the behaviors of the autonomous vehicle (AV), surrounding human-driven vehicles (HDVs), and road network information, outputting vehicle control commands like steering, torque, and braking. The effectiveness of DRL is contingent on vast amounts of training data and computational resources. However, large-scale human driving data collection can be prohibitively expensive. This challenge means DRL models are still vulnerable to unexpected behavior in out-of-sample scenarios and susceptible to malicious backdoors (also known as \"neural Trojans\" or \"Trojan attacks\").\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the backdoor threat to DRL-augmented AD systems through manipulation during the training stage. Various existing neural Trojans can infiltrate AV capabilities related to vision perception, such as image classification, object recognition, and tracking. A backdoored DNN behaves normally with benign samples but produces malicious outcomes when an attacker-specified trigger is present in the input. DRL's challenge with backdoors lies in the need to disrupt sequential decisions rather than isolated ones while maintaining performance in the absence of triggers. Consequently, there is limited research in this area. Notable works include those by Kiourti et al., who used image patterns as backdoor triggers, and Ashcraft et al., who examined DRL backdoors using action trajectories as triggers. One study focused specifically on DRL-based AD using vehicle speed and position combinations as triggers. These backdoor triggers are insightful for DRL-based AD, motivating the investigation of stealthier and more practical backdoors that real-world attackers can easily activate.\n\nThe DRL agent learns optimal policies through environmental interactions. While most DRL methods assume complete observability of the environment, the occlusions and noisy sensors in AVs result in only partial visibility of the system state. A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) can better capture the dynamics of the AD environment, but finding an optimal policy for POMDP is notoriously difficult. A common approach is to integrate a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a generative model to uncover hidden states and generate optimal policies. This partial observability can advantageously aid hackers, suggesting that embedding a backdoor trigger in unobservable states can increase stealth.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to hide backdoor triggers into spatiotemporal traffic features, crucial for ensuring AD performance. We design a spatiotemporal DNN model for DRL using the gate recurrent unit (GRU) and attention mechanisms to capture features from observations. Our evaluations reveal that these features notably enhance the efficiency and safety of DRL algorithms across different AD tasks. We also examine the security of these features by crafting a backdoor trigger based on the temporal and spatial relevance of a sequence of states, introducing a spatiotemporal-pattern stealthy Trojan attack on DRL-augmented AD systems. This attack enables an attacker to control spatial and temporal dependencies between the AV and an attacker\u2019s vehicle through specific driving behaviors, activating the backdoor. Once triggered, the AV is controlled by backdoor neurons using malicious rewards to dictate actions while keeping the value of these rewards similar to original genuine rewards for stealth.",
        "Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) have garnered significant attention for data generation.  These models perturb target data into Gaussian noise via a diffusion process and learn the reverse process to reconstruct the original data. Conditional SBDMs, incorporating guidance such as class labels, text, or low-resolution images, have demonstrated considerable success in image generation and translation.  Traditional conditional SBDMs rely on paired data, where each target sample has a corresponding condition, for example, a high-resolution image paired with its low-resolution counterpart in super-resolution. However, obtaining sufficient paired training data can be challenging in real-world applications due to labeling costs.  Therefore, developing SBDMs that can leverage unpaired or partially paired training data is crucial, particularly for tasks like unpaired or semi-paired image-to-image translation (I2I).\n\nWhile several SBDM-based approaches exist for unpaired I2I, they often employ unconditional score-based models, imposing conditions during inference through techniques like cycle consistency, initial state design, or guidance terms.  Training *conditional* score-based models directly with unpaired data remains an open question.  Furthermore, few SBDMs address the partially paired scenario, where a limited amount of paired data is available alongside a larger unpaired dataset.\n\nThis paper addresses the challenge of training conditional score-based models with unpaired or partially paired data, focusing on I2I applications where condition and target data are images from different domains.  The key challenges are twofold: (1) the absence of a direct relationship between condition and target data hinders training, and (2) even with an estimated relationship, it's unclear how to train the model effectively without explicit condition-target pairs.\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce the Optimal Transport-guided Conditional Score-based diffusion model (OTCS).  Unlike existing OT-related SBDMs that focus on understanding or enhancing *unconditional* models, OTCS leverages optimal transport (OT) to enable *conditional* SBDM training with unpaired or partially paired data.\n\nFor unpaired settings, such as unpaired super-resolution, we utilize unsupervised OT to model the coupling relationship between condition and target data.  This approach aligns with the common practice of translating condition data to the target domain while preserving image structure.",

MEC technology brings data processing closer to the user end, thereby reducing the distance and time of data transmission in the network, and improving processing speed and efficiency [2], [3]. However, with the explosive growth of the number of devices and data volume, existing MEC solutions face challenges in signal coverage and network capacity.\n\nRecently, fluid antenna (FA) [4], also known as movable antenna [5], has emerged as a promising technology in wireless communications, attracting widespread attention for its ability to boost system performance through dynamic antenna adjustments. Studies have explored the basic principles of FA technology, including research on a new spatial block correlation model for FA systems [6]. Furthermore, researchers have investigated FA's performance in specific wireless communication scenarios, such as FA-assisted multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communication systems [7], [8] and multiuser uplink communication systems based on FA [9]. These studies demonstrate FA's potential in improving spectral efficiency, reducing transmit power, and optimizing signal receiving quality.\n\nThe combination of FA with other emerging technologies, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces [10] and massive MIMO [11], opens a new dimension in wireless communication system design. Given FA's inherent advantages, it has the potential to address the challenges faced by MEC, such as reducing system delays and enhancing resource utilization efficiency.\n\nIn this letter, we propose a novel FA-enabled MEC scheme, which aims to minimize the total system delay and improve MEC service quality by dynamically optimizing antenna positions and computing resource allocation. Specifically, we introduce this scheme and formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the total delay. We then design an alternating iterative algorithm based on the interior point method and particle swarm optimization (IPPSO) to find the optimal solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPPSO-based algorithm has good convergence. Comparing with two baseline schemes, the proposed FA-enabled MEC scheme shows significant advantages in reducing the total system delay.\n\n---\n\nYiping Zuo, Biyun Sheng, Chen Dai, and Fu Xiao are with the School of Computer Science, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210023, China (Email: zuoyiping@njupt.edu.cn, biyunsheng@njupt.edu.cn, daichen@njupt.edu.cn, xiaof@njupt.edu.cn).\n\nJiajia Guo and Shi Jin are with the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China (email: jiajiaguo@seu.edu.cn, jinshi@seu.edu.cn).",

This interest has intensified following numerous successful experiments [2]-[15] that have demonstrated synthetic DNA's viability as a reliable data storage medium. These pioneering experiments have unveiled several critical information-theoretic challenges, with the most pertinent being reliable communication over channels that introduce insertions, deletions, and substitutions (IDSs) [16].\n\nThe DNA synthesis and sequencing processes inherently introduce IDS errors. Additionally, channels that introduce IDSs have been proposed as models for synchronization errors, making coding techniques essential for improving the reliability of both DNA storage systems and channels prone to desynchronization.\n\n## Historical Context and Recent Developments\n\nResearch on synchronization errors dates back several decades. Seminal papers from the 1960s and 1970s explored information-theoretic aspects of IDS errors, with some proposing corrective coding schemes [17]-[21]. In recent years, several significant error-correcting code constructions for the IDS channel have emerged. Notable among these is Davey and MacKay's work [22], which introduced a concatenated coding scheme combining an inner block code with an outer low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. Their innovative decoding algorithm, based on dynamic programming, represents the inner code and channel through a hidden Markov model (HMM), enabling the inference of a posteriori probabilities (APPs) for the outer decoder.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, researchers extended the Markov process of convolutional codes to the IDS channel [23], [24], while others introduced improvements to the original decoding algorithm [25]. Additional advances include the use of marker codes as inner codes [26] and the development of standalone solutions using LDPC codes [27] and polar codes [28], [29].\n\n## DNA Storage: Multiple Sequence Challenges\n\nDNA-based storage presents unique challenges, as data is synthesized into numerous short DNA strands, each replicated thousands of times. During DNA sequencing, multiple copies of each data strand are retrieved. Traditional decoding typically employs multiple sequence alignment (MSA) [30]-[33] followed by majority decision alignment, a method successfully implemented in recent experiments [8], [9], [13], [15].\n\n## Our Contributions\n\nThis paper presents concatenated coding schemes for multiple sequence transmission over parallel IDS channels using the DNA alphabet. Key innovations include:\n\n1. Two novel decoding algorithms for multiple reads:\n   - An exact symbolwise maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder using a multidimensional trellis\n   - A sub-optimal but practical decoder that processes sequences independently\n\n2. Enhanced performance through optimization techniques for both inner and outer codes, including a time-varying code (TVC) design\n\n3.

For example, the word \"rechargeable\" is much more common in electronics product reviews than in book reviews, while the word \"readable\" is much more common in book reviews. Existing language models [4, 15] have exhibited outstanding performance in text classification tasks, but they fail to generalize to new domains without expensive labeling and retraining (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Language models perform worse when domain shift is present. The figure shows the cross-validation results of BERT baseline models trained on 5 domains. The prediction accuracy of the models tested on the trained domain is 5-15% higher than those tested on distant domains.\n\n## Current Approaches and Limitations\n\nExisting unsupervised domain adaptation methods for text classification can be grouped into two categories:\n\n1. Task-agnostic methods [16, 7, 12, 9], which generally ignore the correlation among words across domains\n2. Pivot-based methods, which use domain-independent words (pivots) to bridge the domain gap\n\nThe most prominent pivot-based approach is Structure Correspondence Learning (SCL) and its variants [2, 25, 27]. While SCL effectively learns domain-invariant features for pivots, it faces two critical limitations:\n\n1. It uses all non-pivots to predict pivot terms, leading to noisy inference and false correlations\n2. Its pivots are pre-defined only on labeled source domain texts and unlabeled target domain texts, without ensuring consistent behavior across domains\n\n## Introducing DASK: A Novel Solution\n\nTo address these limitations, we present Domain Adaptation with Structured Knowledge (DASK), which approaches domain adaptation from a Knowledge Graph (KG) perspective. DASK offers several advantages:\n\n1. It filters out false correlations by building a knowledge graph to explicitly capture relationships between pivots and non-pivots\n2. It employs a novel knowledge injection (KI) mechanism for learning domain-invariant features\n3. It dynamically learns pivots during training using pseudo-labels and memory banks\n\n## Key Contributions\n\nOur major contributions include:\n\n- Development of DASK for text classification, incorporating knowledge graph facts for better cross-domain adaptation\n- Construction of a novel knowledge graph using BERT attention scores\n- Design of a pivot-induced cross-domain knowledge injection mechanism\n- Implementation of memory banks for learning domain-invariant pivots\n- Empirical validation showing up to 2.9% improvement over strong baselines on cross-domain sentiment classification across 20 domain pairs\n\n2 Related Work [section continues...]\n\nThis restructured version presents a clearer progression from problem statement to solution, with better-organized sections and more logical transitions between ideas.

These are often used to transform boundary value problems into boundary integral equations, which are preferred for numerical solutions due to their conditioning properties and ability to handle complex geometries. Recent advances in hierarchical linear algebra, fast multipole methods, quadrature for singular functions, and computational geometry have made high-order accurate solutions via integral equations increasingly common.\n\nHowever, for non-constant-coefficient PDEs, the analytical and numerical machinery is limited due to the lack of known Green's functions. While most numerical approaches use direct discretization through finite elements or finite difference schemes, approximate Green's functions (parametrix) can sometimes transform these PDEs into integral equations.\n\n# Surface PDEs and Their Applications\n\n## Definition and Basic Forms\n\nSurface PDEs extend planar problems to smooth closed surfaces embedded in R\u00b3.

        "This paper addresses the question of robot sensors from a more fundamental and theoretical perspective, contrasting the current consumer-driven approach where sensors are purchased based on availability and profitability. This prevailing approach imposes practical constraints, such as being limited to existing technologies and relying on roboticists to heuristically determine the necessary information for a robot to achieve its goals. Moreover, any reasoning about task structure is rarely formalized and often relies on assumptions taken for granted, such as believing that greater sensor precision is better for a fixed price.\n\nIn contrast, our study investigates robots that act to attain goals under uncertainty, formulating these scenarios as planning problems under worst-case non-determinism. Unlike many papers focused solely on planning solutions, our work examines how sensor choices influence the feasibility of planning problems. We explore the space of sensors useful for specific problems, looking at sensor/plan pairs jointly. These sensors, even those providing minimal information, can offer valuable insights. However, they must still provide sufficient information to progress toward goals, even amid uncertainty.\n\nThe specific sensors necessary depend on the robot's objectives. We are particularly interested in exploring all conceivable sensors, including hypothetical ones, for which some goal-achieving plan exists. Sensors can be modeled based on the information they provide for the plan. While previous research has regarded sensors as partitions over perceived events, our paper adopts a more general approach, considering sensors as covers. This requires new representations and strategies to mitigate the combinatorial explosion a na\u00efve treatment might entail.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a simple scenario that underscores multiple problem aspects: a wheeled robot (depicted as a blue disk) seeks a charging station while being uncertain about its initial position and unable to navigate stairs. It must avoid stairwells lest it topples. Despite this uncertainty, the robot can recharge its battery using different sensors: a camera, a simple linear distance sensor, or a short-range scanning lidar. A sensorless plan is also possible, assuming permissible wall collisions.\n\nThe example in Figure 1 provides four exemplar sensors ensuring goal attainment under different plans:\n(i) A camera helps eliminate uncertainty in the initial pose by distinguishing red and gray.\n(ii) A distance sensor can disambiguate initial position 2 from {1, 3} by observing proximity to the wall after two forward moves.\n(iii) A lidar sensor distinguishes position 3 from {1, 2}, sensing a different polygon after three forward moves from 3.\n(iv) A vacuous sensor also suffices with the assumption of benign collisions and multiple steps.\n\nWhile these sensors do not completely resolve uncertainty, they reduce it sufficiently to enable goal attainment under varying plans.",
        "The natural connections between approximation theory and optimization, both aiming at finding the \"best\" solution, were first established in the '50s, '60s, and '70s as interest grew in the application of convex analysis within Functional Analysis [16, 24, 39, 40]. Laurent's book in 1972 demonstrated interconnections between approximation and optimization, showing that challenging approximation problems could be tackled using optimization techniques, such as approximating nonsmooth functions with splines. Rational approximations can be a good compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency when dealing with complex optimization problems, especially when spline knot locations are unknown.\n\nIt has been long known that optimization problems arising in rational and generalized rational approximation are quasiconvex, with one of the simplest methods for minimizing such functions being the bisection method [12]. Feasibility problems in rational approximation can be efficiently reduced to solving large-scaled linear programming problems, making the optimization approach tractable and practical. The optimization approach for min-max approximation is explored in this paper, showing that it can be more manageable than least squares. An enhanced algorithm is proposed, incorporating constraints like bounds on the denominator, improving applicability for diverse problems, including evaluating matrix functions.\n\nMatrix functions, which involve lifting scalar functions to a matrix domain, have become increasingly important in various applications like reduced order models, ODE solving, image denoising, and graph neural networks. Rational approximation for matrix functions has emerged as a valuable alternative due to its superior approximation capabilities, although challenges remain in its application. The paper delves into the use of rational approximation for normal matrices, introducing a parameter that balances uniform approximation and matrix conditioning, providing theoretical guarantees, numerical demonstrations, and showcasing an algorithm application for matrix filtering.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents an optimization approach for min-max approximation, highlighting the tractability of the min-max problem compared to least squares. It discusses the advantages of rational approximation for evaluating matrix functions, particularly in the case of normal matrices. The proposed algorithm addresses the tradeoff between uniform approximation and matrix conditioning, offering theoretical guarantees and practical insights through numerical demonstrations and application examples.",
        "The extensive use of AI techniques in decision-making systems is significantly increasing the need for verification of the safety and reliability properties of probabilistic computations. The possibility of formal verification of such properties would grant the ability to consider such systems trustworthy. Nowadays, several approaches to the verification of AI systems are emerging, as discussed in overviews [1, 2]. Notably, these approaches focus on model-checking techniques for safety, liveness, and fairness properties [3, 4], program analysis and synthesis [5], and proof-checkers [6, 7] for their increasing use at the industrial level. However, in the technical literature, little is available on the formalization of a notion of trustworthiness in this context. Current logical approaches to computational trust in general are overviewed in Section 2.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a derivation system dubbed Trustworthy Probabilistic Typed Natural Deduction (TPTND for short). The aim of this system is to formalize the task of inferential reasoning about probabilistic computational processes, particularly regarding their trustworthiness. We begin by defining an operational semantics to consider a probability space in which such computations can be evaluated. This operational semantics defines events with certain probabilities of occurrence and generalizes to samples of such events with frequencies of observed outputs. We then transform these terms under operations for update, conjunction, disjunction, and dependency of outputs.\n\nA full probabilistic \u03bb-calculus for samples of experiments and trust evaluation (excluding other operations) is offered in [8]. Reasoning about such probabilistic computations is provided in the form of logical rules within the language TPTND, allowing for derivation of theoretical probabilities, expected probabilities, and frequencies. Accordingly, judgments in our language are sequents of the form \u0393 $ \u03c6 where \u0393 is a set of assumptions on random variables (called the context), and \u03c6 is a typed formula. These formulas take forms such as:\n- \\(x : \u03b1 a\\), declaring that a random variable \\(x\\) has been assigned value \\(\u03b1\\) with theoretical probability \\(a\\).\n- \\(t^n : \u03b1 \\tilde{a}\\), declaring that the expected probability to obtain value \\(\u03b1\\) in a sample of \\(n\\) trials of process \\(t\\) is \\(a\\).",

        "The increasing demand for compact, resource-constrained devices capable of diverse functions, such as sensing, identification, and machine control, has fueled the development of lightweight cryptographic designs and algorithms.  However, this resource-constrained environment presents significant security challenges.  Implementing traditional cryptographic primitives on these platforms is difficult, requiring a careful balance between compact implementation and robust security. To address this, NIST initiated the standardization process for lightweight cryptography in 2017 [1, 2].\n\nGrounded in the principles of symmetric cryptography, lightweight cryptography aims to secure Internet of Things (IoT) devices like sensors, RFID tags, medical implants, and smart cards.  Design choices including small block and key sizes, simplified round structures and key schedules, and compact implementations make lightweight ciphers ideal for providing sufficient security with minimal power, computational, and memory resources.\n\nNIST's call for proposals resulted in 57 submissions from research teams worldwide [3]. Following two rigorous evaluation rounds, as detailed in NIST IR 8369 [4], ten candidates were selected as finalists (see Table 1).  The third and final round evaluated candidates based on claimed security strength against known attacks (112 bits or more), performance in both hardware and software environments, resilience against side-channel and fault-injection attacks, and intellectual property rights [5].  In February 2023, NIST announced the ASCON family as the new lightweight cryptography standard [6].\n\nA crucial evaluation criterion for cryptographic algorithms is their resistance to known attacks, including differential and linear cryptanalysis (and their variants), as well as implementation-based attacks.  Designers and cryptanalysts globally have worked extensively to meet this requirement, resulting in substantial third-party security analysis of the finalist candidates.  Some notable analyses include:\n\n* **ASCON:** Cihangir T. [7] demonstrated key recovery using differential-linear attacks on 4 and 5 rounds of ASCON with time complexities of 2<sup>15</sup> and 2<sup>33.1</sup>, respectively.  Another study [8] utilized undisturbed s-box bits to perform impossible, truncated, and improbable differential attacks on 4 and 5 rounds. Yanbin L. et al. [9] presented a key recovery attack on ASCON's 7/12 round initialization in a nonce-misuse scenario with a time complexity of 2<sup>97</sup>.",
        "The Transformer model (Vaswani et al. 2017) has set a new standard in several neural language generation (NLG) tasks, such as machine translation (Deng et al. 2018) and text summarization (Chang, Huang, and Hsu 2018). Built upon the encoder-decoder framework, it consists of an encoder network that transforms the input sentence into a sequence of hidden states, each corresponding to a specific word, and a decoder network that generates the output sentence word by word. During each decoding step, the decoder utilizes an attentive reading mechanism (Luong, Pham, and Manning 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) to select the appropriate input hidden states and determine which word to generate next.\n\nDespite its success, the decoding process in the Transformer model relies heavily on local representations encoded in the hidden states, which primarily focus on word-level information. Studies (Vaswani et al. 2017; Devlin et al. 2018; Song et al. 2020) reveal that these hidden states emphasize word-to-word mapping, akin to word alignment, which guides the attention mechanism in generating target words. This approach, however, lacks explicit incorporation of global sentence-level information.\n\nGlobal information, as Frazier (1987) pointed out, encompasses the overall context of a sentence, which is crucial in neural text generation tasks. In recurrent neural network (RNN) based models (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), introducing global information has been shown to improve output quality and reduce redundancy, as demonstrated by Chen (2018) in text summarization. Similarly, Lin et al. (2018b) indicated that integrating global information in machine translation yields structurally more accurate sentences. Although self-attention mechanisms in the Transformer can handle long-distance dependencies, they lack a specific mechanism for modeling global sentence-level representations.\n\nThis paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel Global Representation Enhanced Transformer (GRET). We divide the challenge into two core issues: (1) how to model global contextual information, and (2) how to integrate this global information into the generation process. For the first issue, we propose two complementary methods during the encoding stage to generate global representations from local word-level representations. Firstly, a modified capsule network (Sabour, Frosst, and Hinton 2017) is employed to extract global features from local states, overcoming the redundancy and noise inherent in direct word-to-word mappings. Capsule networks, known for their strong feature extraction capabilities (Zhao et al. 2018), are effective in synthesizing comprehensive feature vectors.\n\nSecondly, we introduce a layer-wise recurrent structure to enhance global representations by aggregating information across different layers. Previous research (Peters et al. 2018; Dou et al. 2018) suggests that different layers capture varied linguistic aspects\u2014lower layers are more syntactic, while higher layers are more semantic. By combining inter-layer information, our method constructs a holistic global context, complementing the intra-layer information extracted by the capsule network.\n\nFor the second issue, we propose a context gating mechanism to dynamically control the integration of global representation into the decoder at each step.",
        "Visual navigation is central to most autonomous robotic applications, such as self-driving cars and service robots.  A key challenge for these robots is efficiently exploring and robustly identifying navigable space, ultimately finding the shortest paths within complex, obstacle-filled environments.  The robotics and deep learning communities have developed models trained with reinforcement learning (RL), inverse RL, or imitation learning. These models target complex scenarios requiring visual reasoning beyond simple waypoint navigation, enabling novel interactions, like responding to queries such as, \"Where are my keys?\"  However, current learning algorithms require vast amounts of data\u2014hundreds of millions or even billions of interactions\u2014to achieve such capabilities.  Acquiring this data using physical robots in real-world environments is impractical and time-consuming, potentially leading to robot damage.\n\nTo address this, the field relies heavily on simulation, which allows training to proceed significantly faster on modern hardware.  Multiple simulated environments can be easily distributed across numerous cores and machines.  However, neural networks trained in simulated environments often perform poorly when deployed in the real world due to the \"sim-to-real gap.\"  This gap stems from inaccuracies in simulating real-world conditions, including image acquisition, sensor noise, furniture changes, and other displaced objects.  The exact nature of this gap is often difficult to pinpoint.  Even subtle, sometimes imperceptible, adversarial examples\u2014like a few pixel shifts\u2014can significantly alter a trained model's decisions [12, 20, 27].\n\nVarious methods address the sim-to-real gap, including domain randomization, which treats reality as a single parameterization within a vast range of simulations [25, 37], and domain adaptation, which explicitly adapts a simulation-trained model to the real world [6, 40].  However, identifying the sources of the sim-to-real gap could help experts design and optimize transfer methods by targeting specific simulator and agent design choices.",
        "Facial expression recognition (FER) is a critical task within the computer vision community, aimed at enabling computer programs to automatically identify facial expressions from input images. This task has garnered significant interest due to its wide-ranging applications in human-computer interactions, medical progress monitoring, and driver fatigue monitoring, among other fields. However, FER presents unique challenges, particularly when conducted \"in the wild.\" The difficulty arises from the significant intraclass variances and inter-class similarities among expression categories, which make it distinct from general image classification tasks. For instance, the same individual in identical lighting and posture may display different expressions, while people of various identities, ages, genders, and poses may express the same emotion.\n\nIn recent years, the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has led to numerous methods that significantly enhance FER performance. However, the Vision Transformer (ViT), introduced for image classification, has emerged as a promising alternative due to its non-local self-attention mechanism. Despite its potential, ViT's performance in FER remains inferior to state-of-the-art CNNs, with the exception of the TransFER model. The primary issue is that ViT requires extensive data for training, owing to its large number of parameters and lack of inductive bias. The existing FER datasets are much smaller compared to general image classification datasets like ImageNet, making it challenging for Transformer-based modules to converge well and often result in a focus on occlusion or background areas instead.\n\nVarious methods, such as regularization and attention techniques, have been proposed to tackle these issues. The TransFER model, for example, generates an attention map to reduce the impact of noisy features by multiplying them with the feature maps. However, even in this model, noisy features are still fed into downstream processes. This raises the question: Why compute noisy features if they are already identified as noise?\n\nBenefiting from the flexible design of the Transformer model, which can adopt any number of tokens as input without altering model parameters, we propose the Attentive Patch Pooling (APP) module to directly discard noisy features. Unlike simply multiplying noisy features with a small value, the APP module pools them directly, as shown in Fig. 1. This approach takes advantage of the attention mechanism in Transformer blocks, making it more intuitive to perform attentive pooling.\n\nRecent findings, such as those from CPVT, suggest that replacing the [class] token with global average pooling (GAP) can improve performance. DeepViT further investigated this, finding that attention maps become similar after certain layers and proposed a Re-attention method to increase layer diversity. In contrast, inspired by the Max Pooling technique in CNNs, which reduces feature map size and provides an abstract and robust representation, we directly drop less essential tokens, retaining only a small number to embed information. The Attentive Token Pooling (ATP) module utilizes the Transformer's attention mechanism to discard less important tokens in deep blocks. Fig. 2 illustrates the differences between these methods, showing how ATP gradually decreases the token number in deep blocks to interrupt noisy feature propagation more effectively than Max Pooling.\n\nOur proposed APViT model, which combines APP and ATP, is illustrated in Fig. 2(d). This model offers several key contributions:\n\n1. The APP module selects the most distinguishable local patches from CNN feature maps, preventing noisy patches from affecting recognition performance downstream.\n2. The ATP module leverages the Transformer's attention mechanism to focus only on the top-k relevant tokens, reducing the influence of noise and occlusions and saving computation time.\n3. Experimental results on several challenging in-the-wild datasets demonstrate the advantages of our APViT method over state-of-the-art approaches.",
        "In this short paper, we outline the work done during the IRISCAST project [2] to evaluate the full lifecycle climate emissions associated with an active DRI. This involves cataloguing the resources that compose the DRI and measuring energy consumption for a defined period of the operation of the DRI. To convert the collected data into the impact on the climate of the DRI, we have developed a carbon model to produce an overall figure for the climate impact of a 24-hour period of operating the IRIS DRI.\n\nMoving towards Net-Zero for digital research infrastructures (DRIs) requires robust information to enable good decision-making around infrastructure procurement and provisioning. This entails understanding the full carbon costs or climate impacts associated with operating, maintaining, and using the infrastructure, going beyond accounting for just the electricity and cooling required for operations and including the entire chain of costs embodied in the infrastructure.\n\nDuring this process, we have identified many areas where data is either incomplete or of variable quality, indicating the need for more comprehensive information. For the rest of the paper, we will introduce the IRIS DRI, briefly discuss the IRISCAST approach, outline the carbon model we have designed, and then discuss the results of monitoring and evaluating the DRI for a 24-hour period to quantify the climate impact of such a system. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work and future research that could enhance the accuracy of such measurement approaches.",
        "The necessity of equipping transmitters and receivers with multiple antennas in wireless communication systems has been acknowledged for over a century. The initial advantage observed was the adaptive directivity achieved by controlling the constructive and destructive superposition of electromagnetic (EM) signals using an antenna array. This technique, known as beamforming, allows a transmitter to focus a signal on a desired receiver while minimizing interference at specific locations. Similarly, a receiver can enhance signals from a particular direction while suppressing unwanted interference using multiple antennas.\n\nAnother benefit is the increased robustness against channel fading offered by multiple antennas. As the number of antennas and the array size increase, it becomes less likely for all transmit-receive antenna pairs to experience deep fades simultaneously. This is known as spatial diversity and channel hardening.\n\nThe most recent advancement in this field is multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, which allows antenna arrays to spatially multiplex multiple data layers at the same time and frequency. This can be implemented in multi-user MIMO mode, where a multiple-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple user equipment (UE) simultaneously. This is facilitated by adaptive beamforming, which enables the BS to give each transmitted signal a different spatial directivity, amplify signals received from UEs in various directions, and filter out interference in both transmission directions. There is also single-user MIMO mode, where a multi-antenna BS and multi-antenna UE exchange multiple data layers simultaneously by beamforming through different propagation paths.\n\nInitially introduced as a premium feature in cellular and WiFi networks, MIMO technology has become mainstream. The 5G technology is built around the Massive MIMO concept, which involves having more antennas at the BS than at the UE, making it feasible to protect data layers from mutual interference through spatial filtering, even with imperfect channel state information (CSI) and hardware impairments. As of 2023, a typical 5G BS has 64 antenna ports and supports up to 16 data layers, such as 8 UEs assigned with two layers each. The increasing demand for data traffic in cellular networks, currently growing at 40% annually, is driving the adoption of MIMO. The 5G MIMO technology, especially in the 3.5 GHz band, can significantly increase capacity compared to 4G, allowing higher speeds per device and accommodating more simultaneous connections. If data traffic continues to grow at the current rate over the next decade, 6G technology will need to deliver approximately 30 times the capacity of current networks. Emerging user devices, such as those for augmented reality, and services, like federated learning and hyper-reliable low-latency communication, may accelerate wireless traffic growth. Therefore, next-generation MIMO technology should aim to support at least 100 times the capacity of current networks.",
        "Driven by the need to perform tasks in remote environments, teleoperation has emerged as a central robotic paradigm with applications ranging from deep sea exploration to outer space missions. A significant challenge in this domain is generating smooth, goal-directed robot trajectories when discrepancies exist between operator and remote robot workspaces. This problem remains largely unaddressed among the state-of-the-art teleoperation frameworks and is illustrated with a valve-turning example, depicted in Fig. 1. \n\nIn this paper, we propose an object-centered motion mapping framework for continuous bilateral teleoperation. Our main objective is to overcome the limitations of naive joint space mappings and enhance teleoperation by using object-centered representations. As shown in Fig. 2, direct joint space mappings impose strong embodiment constraints, which many teleoperation frameworks attempt to mitigate through task space representations. However, even simple differences between local and remote environments can cause failures in remote robot execution. This necessitates object-centered approaches, although they often scale poorly with the number of objects involved.\n\nA common solution is to pause communication between the haptic device and the remote robot, relocating the haptic device and continuing the task based on visual feedback. Yet, this discontinuous manipulation leads to low efficiency and transparency, particularly in tasks involving multiple objects. Our approach reshapes the task space to ensure that the robot adapts to points of interest differing between the two sides, maintaining continuity, smoothness, and precision.\n\nOur primary contribution is an object-centered formulation for task space motion mapping between the local and remote robot, which includes: \n1) adaptability to different object poses between local and remote workspaces (either real or virtual); \n2) invertible and continuously differentiable position and orientation mappings; \n3) bilateral teleoperation capabilities, utilizing impedance control for both haptic guidance and compliant interaction with the environment.\n\nWe employ a bilateral teleoperation setup with two Franka Emika Panda robots. One serves as a haptic device on the operator's side, while the other acts as a remote robot in the targeted environment. This setup allows the operator to focus on the local setup, driving the input device to execute tasks locally, while the remote robot performs them synchronously despite different object poses.\n\nTo achieve the proposed mappings, we present two possible implementations: an iterative approach and a neural network (NN) approach, detailed in Sections IV and V, respectively. Experimental results in Section VII indicate that the neural network approach is more advantageous due to faster mapping evaluations, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed framework.",
        "Deep learning advancements have significantly impacted various fields such as Software Engineering (SE), healthcare, computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. These advancements have enabled remarkable progress in recent years. For instance, processes like predicting sales and disease detection using computer vision highlight the integration of deep learning models in SE, marking a significant trend in the industry.\n\nThe integration of machine learning algorithms with SE tasks, such as code generation and malware detection, is gaining popularity among big tech companies. Research in this area has led to more than 40 SE tasks being integrated with deep learning, with over 60 research papers accepted at various venues. While machine learning algorithms learn autonomously, it is crucial to ensure model quality before deployment to achieve precision in software development.\n\nAlthough deep learning benefits software development, it can lead to increased memory utilization compared to traditional software. However, advancements in cloud platforms have facilitated the implementation of larger machine learning algorithms in software effectively. Research efforts are focused on reducing memory consumption, with techniques such as model compression and utilizing cloud storage for ML models proving effective in optimizing resource utilization for software applications.\n\nReal-time monitoring of memory usage is essential to analyze and optimize deep learning models, especially considering factors such as the increase in nodes, layers, training epochs, and input data quality that contribute to memory utilization.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Multi-Timescale LSTM Networks for Human Behavior Prediction in AI-Human Teaming\n\n## Introduction\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of people's daily lives, driving innovations across diverse fields including healthcare (Toosizadeh et al. 2019), banking (Netzer, Lemaire, and Herzenstein 2019), military applications (Blitch 1996), and space exploration (Hedberg 1997). While people initially relied on AI primarily as tools for daily activities like scheduling and driving, recent years have seen AI evolve into socially intelligent agents. This evolution has given rise to Human-Machine Teaming (HMT), where AI agents work alongside human teammates to achieve common goals.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nTo be an effective teammate, an AI agent must excel at understanding, identifying, and predicting human behavior. AI systems capable of accurately predicting future behavior based on past observations can intervene to enhance team efficiency and performance. Such predictive AI capabilities have valuable applications across multiple domains, including game design, biomedical engineering (Cui, Chen, and Chen 2016), and autonomous driving (Gopinath et al. 2022).\n\nHuman behavior, particularly in goal-oriented tasks like Urban Search and Rescue (USAR), exhibits a hierarchical structure associated with both short-term and long-term goals unfolding across multiple timescales. While accurate behavioral prediction requires understanding this hierarchical structure, relatively little attention has been paid to modeling human behavior at multiple timescales. Research has shown that models incorporating features evaluated over multiple timescales outperform single-timescale models in various applications, including:\n\n- Driver drowsiness detection through facial videos (Massoz, Verly, and Van Droogenbroeck 2018)\n- Automated speech recognition from raw speech signals (Takeda, Nakadai, and Komatani 2018)\n- Text classification (Liu et al. 2015)\n\n## Our Contribution\n\nWe present an LSTM network architecture that processes human behavioral information at multiple timescales to predict future behavior from past observations. Our approach draws inspiration from the works of Hihi and Bengio (1995), Koutnik et al. (2014), and Liu et al. (2015), who designed LSTMs with delayed connections and units operating at different timescales. The model takes two minutes of behavioral data as input and predicts thirty seconds of future behavior.\n\nOur results demonstrate that the multi-timescale LSTM model substantially outperforms single-timescale LSTM models in predicting future behavior. We validate our findings against baseline measures that account for various biases in the behavioral data, including class imbalance and experimental design biases.\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\nWe test our hypothesis in an urban search and rescue (USAR) scenario simulated in a virtual Minecraft-based testbed, developed as part of DARPA's ASIST program (Huang et al. 2022). This scenario provides a demanding and realistic environment for adaptive AI development (Tr\u0203ichioiu and Visser 2015), featuring:\n- Dynamic environmental conditions\n- In-game perturbations\n- Time-critical civilian rescue requirements\n\n## Paper Structure\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\n1. Related work in the field\n2. Description of the Minecraft USAR mission data\n3. Process for defining player behavior in Minecraft\n4. Evaluation of baseline measures\n5. Detailed architecture of the multi-timescale LSTM model\n6. Results and discussion",
        "**Introduction to Knowledge Graphs and Entity Alignment**\n\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) have emerged as a prominent method for storing knowledge by representing entities and their interconnections. As KGs and their applications, such as Question Answering and Information Retrieval, have evolved, the importance of aligning KGs from different sources has grown significantly. Entity Alignment (EA) in KGs, which aims to integrate KGs based on practical requirements, is fundamental in the field of data integration.\n\n**Challenges in Entity Alignment**\n\nThe heterogeneity of KGs, derived from various sources, presents significant challenges in aligning entities. EA research primarily focuses on identifying and exploiting correlations between heterogeneous KGs through deep learning techniques, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Since 2019, over 70% of EA studies have incorporated GNNs, capitalizing on their ability to capture KGs' structural correlations, achieving remarkable performance on benchmark EA datasets.\n\n**Addressing Heterogeneity in Knowledge Graphs**\n\nOvercoming heterogeneity and mining correlations between KGs are the main concerns of EA. Existing methods often evaluate performance on widely-used KG datasets, particularly cross-lingual KGs. However, heterogeneity is not limited to linguistic differences; it includes varying data sources, scales, structures, and temporal information. Highly heterogeneous KGs (HHKGs), where source and target KGs differ significantly, pose additional challenges. Figure 1 illustrates a toy example of HHKGs, highlighting differences in scale, structure, and density, with minimal overlap.\n\n**Practical Applications and Limitations of Current EA Methods**\n\nPractical applications demonstrate the necessity of studying HHKG alignment. For instance, personal KGs aim to integrate domain knowledge with general KGs for personalized recommendations, and geospatial databases require aligning entities from multiple knowledge providers. Despite the urgency, most EA methods are evaluated on limited benchmarks, lacking datasets for HHKG research, which hinders understanding of EA methods, especially GNN-based ones, and limits their practical application.\n\n**Research Questions and Dataset Analysis**\n\nThis work addresses two essential research questions:\n- RQ1: What are the limitations of existing EA datasets, and what gaps exist between them and practical scenarios?\n- RQ2: What EA methods are needed in practical applications?\n\nTo answer RQ1, we analyze existing EA datasets and discuss their limitations through statistical analysis. We identify unreasonable assumptions and oversimplified settings and propose two new datasets, ICEWS-WIKI and ICEWS-YAGO, to better reflect practical scenarios.\n\n**Methodological Evaluation and Proposed Solutions**\n\nFor RQ2, we conduct empirical evaluations of representative EA methods on HHKG datasets. We find that GNN-based methods, which perform well on traditional EA datasets, struggle under HHKG conditions. GNNs' reliance on implicit structural patterns fails when HHKGs' structure information is challenging to utilize. This leads us to reconsider the progress of GNN-based EA methods.\n\n**Insights and Proposed Method: Simple-HHEA**\n\nWe further investigate GNN components causing performance degradation on HHKGs. Our analysis reveals:\n1. The complexity of HHKG structure information challenges message passing and aggregation, leading to poor GNN performance.\n2. The necessity of leveraging structural information, especially when other data quality cannot be guaranteed, calls for EA models that can adaptively exploit diverse information types.\n\nIn response, we propose a simple yet effective method, Simple-HHEA, which jointly leverages entity names, structure, and temporal information. Extensive experiments on proposed and benchmark datasets underscore three keys for EA models: adaptability to diverse information quality, capability to extract clues from heterogeneous data, and efficiency.\n\n**Contributions**\n\n1. We identify the limitations of previous EA datasets and propose a practical task, EA on HHKGs, supported by two new datasets.\n2. We critically evaluate existing GNN-based EA methods, highlighting potential issues from oversimplified dataset settings.\n3. We provide a direction for future EA improvements through the implementation of Simple-HHEA, a straightforward yet effective approach.",
        "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great efficacy in tackling complex reasoning tasks. One key technique contributing to their success is the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method (Wei et al., 2022b), which encourages LLMs to engage in multi-step reasoning rather than providing direct answers. This approach significantly enhances the model's capacity to handle challenging tasks such as arithmetic and symbolic questions.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of CoT largely hinges on the quality of the demonstrations provided. In instances where no examples are given except for the prompt \"Let's think step by step,\" known as Zero-Shot-CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), LLMs struggle with reasoning and encounter issues related to hallucination. While manually designing demonstrations for each question can mitigate such problems (Wei et al., 2022b), it comes with a substantial labor cost. To tackle these challenges, Zhang et al. (2023) propose Auto-CoT, which can automatically generate demonstrations as prompts. This method initially groups questions from a dataset into clusters and then selects a representative question from each cluster. These chosen questions are answered using Zero-Shot-CoT to derive their rationales (the intermediate reasoning chain). The automated method's performance is comparable to that of Manual-CoT.\n\nDespite the effectiveness of the automated method, the development of a robust and comprehensive set of demonstrations remains an area for further investigation. Several studies recommend incorporating external knowledge to ensure the accuracy of the intermediate reasoning chain (Zhao et al., 2023; Weng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Others suggest generating multiple CoT paths and implementing a verification process to maintain coherence (Wang et al., 2023b; Yao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, existing research primarily focuses on the precision of demonstrations, with limited exploration of the distributional power inherent in these demonstrations. Building on the works of Min et al. (2022) and Madaan et al. (2023), LLMs engage in CoT through a counterfactual approach. This approach doesn't require precise example results but instead learns from the underlying patterns (e.g., equations, templates) demonstrated by the examples.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach termed Pattern-Aware Chain-of-Thought (PA-CoT) and illustrate that LLMs can enhance reasoning performance by embracing the diversity inherent in demonstration patterns. Following the Auto-CoT framework, we automatically generate question clusters and select representative questions from each cluster. However, instead of relying solely on question embeddings for clustering, we explore multiple methods to enhance the diversity of rationale patterns.",
        "Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a technique aimed at restoring a visually pleasing high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) version, presenting a significant challenge in the computer vision research community. Due to the existence of multiple solutions for mapping LR to HR space, SISR is highly ill-posed, prompting the development of various algorithms, notably the current leading learning-based methods, to tackle this issue.\n\nUnderstanding the essence of the SISR problem is essential for devising a viable solution. When dealing with a low-resolution image during inference, there is no definitive answer on how the high-resolution counterpart is generated. Therefore, assumptions must be made to recover a higher-resolution image while preserving the visible artifacts from the low-resolution image. The incorporation of fine details into the higher-resolution image is subjective, as it should align with the existing artifacts from the low-resolution image. The primary objective in SISR is to devise a model capable of making these assumptions to generate high-resolution images that closely resemble reality, especially in specialized tasks such as Face SISR. Currently, all existing solutions for the SISR problem aim to reconstruct a single high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input, following a deterministic process where the same low-resolution image will consistently yield the same high-resolution output.\n\nThis paper argues for an approach in solving the SISR problem that produces multiple high-resolution candidates for a single low-resolution image, offering a novel method to address this challenge. The proposed SR-NAM method is an unsupervised technique that maps high-resolution images to a specified low-resolution image efficiently, requiring optimization of a single representation. This representation seeks to align with pre-trained knowledge of both the high-resolution image space and the degradation method.",
        "This article presents new efficient algorithms for evaluating $p$-adic elementary and special functions, achieving quasi-linear time complexity in the desired precision. This represents a significant improvement over previous methods, which often exhibited at least quadratic complexity.  These functions, including polylogarithms, hypergeometric functions, and solutions of \"small\" $p$-adic differential equations, play a crucial role in various mathematical fields such as analysis, geometry, combinatorics, and number theory. Their $p$-adic analogues are equally important, encoding deep arithmetic information, as illustrated by $p$-adic $L$-functions and their connection to Iwasawa theory and algebraic varieties.  The ability to compute these functions efficiently has far-reaching implications for calculating invariants and testing conjectures, mirroring the significance of high-precision evaluation of complex special functions, which has seen remarkable algorithmic advancements.\n\n\nOur algorithms leverage a $p$-adic adaptation of the bit-burst method, pioneered by Chudnovsky and Chudnovsky, which builds upon the binary splitting technique and other ideas originating from Brent's work. This core technique is enhanced by incorporating improvements from later research.  The key to achieving quasi-linear complexity lies in the existence of recurrence relations satisfied by partial sums of series expansions. The binary splitting method efficiently computes the $n$-th partial sum by expressing it as a product of matrices based on this recurrence and constructing a balanced product tree.\n\nWhile binary splitting is highly effective for small integer evaluation points, a multi-step process is employed for general evaluation points. This involves constructing a sequence of intermediate points with increasing bit sizes but decreasing $p$-adic distance to the target. Binary splitting facilitates efficient computation between consecutive intermediate points, ultimately reaching the desired value in quasi-linear time.\n\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 establishes the representation of $p$-adic numbers.  Section 3 introduces the $p$-adic bit-burst method through the illustrative example of $\\log(x)$. Section 4 generalizes the method to solutions of linear differential equations. Finally, Section 5 explores applications, including a fast algorithm for evaluating specific logarithmic derivatives connected to Dwork hypergeometric functions.  An important application of our algorithms is the computation of Frobenius matrices acting on the cohomology of fibrations, which satisfy Picard-Fuchs type differential equations.\n\n\nThe present work continues the trend of developing efficient algorithms for $p$-adic computations, exemplified by previous work on the Morita $p$-adic $\\Gamma$-function, $p$-adic hypergeometric functions, certain $p$-adic $L$-functions, and the computation of Frobenius matrices on $p$-adic cohomology.

        "Achieving stable and robust locomotion on legged systems is a challenging control task due to underactuation, power limitations, and ground impacts. In this work, we aim to improve existing approaches by synthesizing robust reference trajectories. Two main approaches that have proven successful include generating stable reference trajectories and modifying these behaviors online using regulators, as well as determining the desired behavior of the robot in real time using online planning via model predictive control or reinforcement learning.\n\nOur approach for generating robust walking gaits builds upon the Hybrid Zero Dynamics (HZD) method. The HZD framework encodes walking via nontrivial periodic orbits and directly accounts for discrete impact events. One advantage of this approach is that the stability of the walking can be analyzed using the method of Poincar\u00e9 sections for systems with impulse effects. However, synthesizing and controlling these periodic orbits can be challenging due to computational expense and noisy timing of impact events in real-world systems.\n\nThere exists previous work towards generating robust limit cycles; however, these methods can be computationally expensive and do not scale easily to high-dimensional systems. The goal of this work is to develop a method of generating robust limit cycles that is scalable to high-dimensional systems, such as the 18 degree-of-freedom Atalante lower-body exoskeleton. Our approach improves the robustness of nominal reference trajectories by evaluating the extended saltation matrix directly in the gait generation framework, demonstrated in simulation and on hardware for the 7-DOF AMBER-3M planar biped and the 18-DOF Atalante lower-body exoskeleton.\n\nThis paper proposes a robust HZD framework that leverages saltation matrices to synthesize robust nominal walking trajectories. Saltation matrices are first-order approximations of a system's sensitivity to discrete events and have been recently demonstrated for state estimation in hybrid systems and hybrid event shaping. The proposed framework includes the induced norm of the extended saltation matrix in the HZD optimization cost function, leading to stable periodic walking gaits with robust behavior in the real world, even for high-dimensional systems.",
        "Egocentric action anticipation is an essential component of artificial intelligence and computer vision, with applications in various fields such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction systems. This involves anticipating future actions based on current and historical observation data. The task is challenging due to the gap between observed and future actions, making it more difficult than recognizing the present actions.\n\nIn egocentric action anticipation, classic methods are based on recurrent neural networks (RNN). To enhance performance, researchers have developed various network structures and anticipation algorithms. However, existing methods have encountered a performance plateau, with most focusing solely on visual information from videos. This approach has limitations in capturing high-level semantic information crucial for understanding the relationship between current observations and future actions.\n\nTo address the challenges in egocentric action anticipation, a novel Transformer-GRU-based framework enhanced by visual-semantic fusion (VS-TransGRU) is proposed. This framework combines Transformer as the encoder for temporal modeling and GRU as the decoder for anticipating future actions. Semantic features are introduced to provide high-level information, and fusion strategies are employed to integrate visual and semantic cues. The proposed model structure outperforms existing methods by leveraging both visual and semantic inputs for action anticipation.\n\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Transformer-GRU model with semantic features. When incorporating ground truth semantic features, the framework achieves a notable improvement in anticipation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Even with estimated semantic features, the performance shows enhancement, highlighting the significance of integrating semantic information in egocentric action anticipation tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, egocentric action anticipation is a complex task that requires understanding the relationships between observed data and future actions. By incorporating semantic features and utilizing fusion strategies, the proposed VS-TransGRU framework demonstrates superior performance in action anticipation compared to existing methods. This approach represents a significant advancement in the field of egocentric action anticipation, emphasizing the importance of integrating both visual and semantic information for enhanced predictive capabilities.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# Balancing Specification and Generalization in Machine Learning: A Geometric Perspective\n\n## Introduction\n\nA fundamental challenge in machine learning (ML) is striking the optimal balance between specification and generalization (also known as the overfitting-underfitting trade-off). The goal is to develop models that generalize effectively without being overly simplistic (underfitting), while capturing essential patterns in the training data without becoming too complex (overfitting). This delicate balance is typically achieved through statistical methods such as cross-validation, regularization, and careful selection of model complexity.\n\nFrom a geometric perspective, this challenge is fundamentally connected to the manifold structure of real-world data. While nonlinearity is widely considered essential for discovering and exploiting such manifold structures\u2014as evidenced by the kernel trick in support vector machines [48] and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques like IsoMAP [45] and locally linear embedding [40]\u2014it often conflicts with the principles of mathematical rigor and scientific simplicity.\n\n## Nature's Solution and Manifold Geometry\n\nDrawing inspiration from the discovery of place cells [34] and their associated aliasing problem [29, 50], we explore how nature has evolved an elegant solution to efficient learning in mammalian brains. We approach the specification-generalization problem from a novel manifold untangling/tangling perspective [27].\n\nWhitney's embedding theorem [31] demonstrates that manifold untangling becomes more feasible in higher-dimensional spaces. This insight led us to introduce context dependency as a key mechanism for manifold untangling. By using class labels C as contextual variables, we can demonstrate that any manifold P(X) can be untangled (achieving linear dichotomy [6]) in the lifted space P(X, C). The reverse process (tangling) is accomplished through an integral transform that merges variables sharing the same context.\n\n## The Tangling-Untangling Cycle (TUC)\n\nBy connecting tangling/untangling operations with context-independent representation (CIR) and context-dependent representation (CDR), we mathematically demonstrate how to achieve optimal balance between specificity and generalization through paired tangling and untangling operators\u2014a process we term the tangling-untangling cycle (TUC).\n\nTUC serves as a fundamental building block for more sophisticated learning algorithms based on Cartesian products and fractal geometry [28]. The Cartesian product of TUC maintains its cyclic properties, enabling multiscale extension from low to high-dimensional spaces. To reflect the nested structure of physical world data, we developed a fractal-inspired extension where interscale context dependency is governed by an index variable (the positioning trick [26]).\n\n## Biological Implementation\n\nThe efficiency of our proposed learning algorithms is supported by their biological implementation through polychronization neural groups (PNG) [24]. The implementation of TUC via the sleep-wake cycle [13] brings our research full circle to the initial discovery of hippocampal place cells [34]. The alternation between external stimuli presence and absence (default versus perturbation states) provides an energy-efficient, biologically plausible implementation of untangling and tangling operators during wake and sleep modes, respectively.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. A geometric perspective on dimensionality that offers fresh insights into ML specification and generalization, aligning with the direct-fit-to-nature paradigm\n2.",
        "Statistical shape modeling (SSM)/morphological analysis [28] is an important resource for medical and biological applications. SSM broadly involves two distinct parts. The first part is shape representation, which involves describing the anatomy/shape of interest by providing an implicit or explicit representation of the shape. The second part involves using the shape representation to perform subsequent analysis on shape population. \n\nClassical approaches traditionally relied on representing shape via landmark points, often corresponding to distinct anatomical features. However, there have been many automated approaches for dense correspondence discovery that capture the underlying shape statistics [10, 26]. An alternative approach to shape representation is to leverage coordinate transformations between images or geometries, typically members of a population or to a common atlas [19]. This set of transformations implicitly captures the population shape statistics for the objects/anatomies contained in the images. \n\nAutomated shape representation via dense correspondences has its drawbacks. Most such methods rely heavily on preprocessed data, including segmentation, smoothing, alignment, and cropping, which often necessitate manual parameter settings and quality control. This preprocessing, heavy on human resources, may require a level of specific anatomical, clinical, or biological expertise, making shape analysis more challenging. Additionally, automated landmark placement or registration relies on computationally expensive optimization methods, often requiring additional parameter tuning and quality control, which can be a barrier, especially for nonexperts, when the data consists of primarily images/volumes.",
        "Business processes represent transactions internal to or between companies, which take place over a certain amount of time. Business processes do not necessarily have to be supported or executed by a business process management (BPM) system. However, if they are supported by a BPM system, they benefit from coordination, which reduces the effort of the process owner to keep track of tasks, sequence, logging, and so forth.\n\nAt the time of execution, business processes are commonly instantiated by the BPM system with all relevant parameters to distribute tasks correctly. The Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) (1999) defines these parameters, workflow-relevant data, as \"data that is used by a Workflow Management System to determine the state transitions of a workflow instance.\" Long-running processes may require updating or extending these parameters, known as the process's context, during execution to adapt the flow of the process to changing circumstances such as exchange rate fluctuations, weather changes, or traffic congestions impacting logistics processes.\n\nContext-aware information systems have gained more traction in recent years, aiming to provide context to the execution of applications. However, in the BPM domain, research has mostly focused on aspects like process adaptation, process modeling, or managerial aspects of processes. The discussion around describing or implementing an architecture to capture and process context outside the process's control flow has been lacking or has been concentrated on static model configuration or closed environment scenarios like smart factories.\n\nConsider a logistics process involving the delivery of a spare part for a mining machine. If the delivery is at risk of delaying beyond the service level agreement (SLA) due to factors like weather conditions or delays at ports, the machine provider may need to adapt the process by using a different transportation method to meet the SLA. This illustrates the importance of adapting running processes based on context data in real-time scenarios.",
        "Motion blur, typically an unwanted artifact in photography, has been the subject of extensive research focusing on recovering sharp details.  Recent efforts have shifted towards the more complex challenge of reconstructing high-frame-rate sharp videos from blurred images, a task variously termed joint deblurring and interpolation, blur temporal super-resolution, or\u2014for brevity in this paper\u2014blur interpolation.  This technology has broad applications, including video enhancement, slow-motion generation, and analysis of fast-moving objects.\n\nWhile recent studies demonstrate the superiority of joint approaches over cascaded deblurring and interpolation methods, most existing solutions operate within a center-frame interpolation pipeline, limiting their ability to generate latent frames beyond middle moments.  Though DeMFI [28] overcomes this limitation by combining feature-flow and pixel-flow-based warping, overall performance, even on synthetic data, remains suboptimal. We identify the underutilization of temporal correlations within blur as a key factor hindering progress, alongside the lack of a real-world dataset for training and evaluation, which leads to generalization issues.\n\nThis work addresses these two limitations. We introduce a novel transformer-based model, BiT (Blur Interpolation Transformer), incorporating a multiscale residual Swin transformer block (MS-RSTB) to effectively handle multiscale blur and fuse information from adjacent frames.  Furthermore, we propose dual-end temporal supervision (DTS) and temporally symmetric ensembling (TSE) to enhance temporal feature sharing for time-varying motion reconstruction. Consequently, BiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks even without optical flow warping.\n\nTo address the lack of real-world data, we have created RBI, a novel dataset captured using a precisely calibrated hybrid camera system, inspired by [34, 55].  RBI provides time-aligned low-frame-rate blurred and high-frame-rate sharp video pairs, offering a crucial resource for training and evaluating blur interpolation models, thus mitigating the generalization problem and enabling more realistic assessment.  These advancements allow our model to achieve impressive arbitrary blur interpolation results, exemplified by the extraction of 30 sharp frames from a single blurred image (see Fig. 1).\n\nOur key contributions are:\n\n*  The development of BiT, a novel transformer-based model for blur interpolation, featuring MS-RSTB for enhanced multiscale blur handling.\n*  The introduction and validation of DTS and TSE strategies to improve temporal feature learning for accurate motion reconstruction.\n*  The creation and release of RBI, the first real-world dataset for general blur interpolation, providing a much-needed benchmark for the research community.  Extensive experiments demonstrate its validity and value.",

However, a significant disparity exists: while African languages constitute 30% of the world's approximately 6,000 living languages (Skutnabb-Kangas et al., 2003), they remain largely unsupported by modern language technologies, contributing to a widening technological divide (Joshi et al., 2020; Blasi et al., 2022).\n\nSentiment Analysis has emerged as a crucial tool across various fields, including public health, literature, and social sciences (Mohammad, 2022).

        "Remote sensing image (RSI) analysis and interpretation are crucial in computer vision, involving various tasks like land-cover classification, change detection, object detection, and more. Such analysis aids in monitoring natural phenomena and human activities on Earth's surface for purposes such as land-use surveillance, disaster prevention, precision agriculture, and wildfire detection. RSI captures both natural events and human interventions, playing a vital role in applications across geographic information systems, agriculture, environmental science, and numerous other fields.\n\nIn recent decades, the advancement in aerospace technology has led to earth observation satellites producing terabytes of RSIs daily. Despite this abundance, two key challenges remain:\n\n1. High Specialist Manpower Requirement: The need for professional researchers for RSI identification and labeling results in high costs.\n2. Presence of Noisy Labels: The complexity of RSIs makes generating accurate labels during data annotation challenging, leading to an abundance of large but noisy labels that can hinder many tasks. To address these challenges, the remote sensing community is shifting its focus to automatic feature extraction and analysis from unlabeled RSIs. Self-supervised learning (SSL), which leverages the inherent data structure, emerges as a crucial method to utilize large-scale unlabeled RSIs effectively.\n\nEarly SSL methods relied on pretext tasks like jigsaw puzzles, patch localization, and image inpainting, but these methods have limitations in generalizability. Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a superior method, enhancing representation by bringing similar instances closer and separating dissimilar ones. CL captures highly discriminative and generalizable feature representations, standing out among SSL methods.\n\nHowever, applying CL efficiently in remote sensing faces two main obstacles. Firstly, due to the fundamental laws of geography, data samples with close geographical proximity should exhibit some degree of similarity. Current CL paradigms often misclassify geographically and semantically similar samples as negatives, leading to sample confusion. Secondly, RSIs often lack clear foreground-background distinctions, with key information scattered throughout the image. CL, being a global discriminant task, struggles to capture fine-grained details essential for remote sensing tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose SwiMDiff, a novel self-supervised pre-training framework tailored for RSIs.\n\nSwiMDiff enhances CL by incorporating a scene-wide matching strategy that recalibrates data based on associated scenes to prevent mislabeling. It considers intra-class similarity, improving the model's ability to extract global discriminative and semantic information. By integrating a diffusion model, SwiMDiff strengthens the CL encoder, creating a unified training framework that emphasizes local and detailed information. SwiMDiff captures global semantic information and focuses on fine-grained features, providing richer information for remote sensing tasks.\n\nOur evaluation of SwiMDiff on change detection and land-cover classification tasks using datasets like OSCD, LEVIR-CD, BigEarthNet, and EuroSAT demonstrates its superior performance, indicating its potential in remote sensing applications.\n\nIn conclusion, SwiMDiff has been rigorously tested on change detection and land-cover classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results and showcasing its capability to handle complex remote sensing tasks effectively.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, with improved clarity, flow, and academic style:\n\n# Decimal Arithmetic in Modern Computing Systems: A Software-Hardware Perspective\n\nIEEE 754, the standard for floating-point arithmetic, has been updated to include decimal floating-point formats and operations, reflecting the widespread use of decimal arithmetic in financial and scientific applications [1]. While many software languages support decimal arithmetic through binary hardware units, this approach may not deliver adequate performance for large-scale applications. Financial institutions, in particular, must maintain high-quality customer service while managing intensive back-end computations, where processing time is critical for business operations.\n\nDecimal arithmetic can be implemented through three approaches:\n1. Software implementation using binary hardware units [2-4]\n2. Dedicated hardware units for decimal floating-point arithmetic [5-8]\n3. Hybrid software-hardware solutions [9]\n\nSoftware solutions offer flexibility without additional hardware costs, while hardware solutions provide high performance but require significant hardware investment. Software-hardware co-design solutions present an optimal middle ground, offering multiple Pareto-efficient points that balance flexibility, performance, and hardware costs. In these hybrid solutions, certain operations are handled by dedicated hardware while others run on standard binary arithmetic processors. However, evaluating such co-design solutions requires specialized evaluation environments.\n\nPrevious research [9] proposed four software-hardware co-design methods for decimal multiplication. Software components were evaluated across multiple platforms using dummy functions to simulate hardware components, while hardware elements were assessed using computer-aided design tools. While this approach provided rough performance estimates, it lacked precision in measuring total system performance.\n\nFor more accurate evaluation, an integrated environment incorporating dedicated hardware design, software platforms, and their interfaces is essential. While open-source processors like Oracle/Sun's UltraSparc T2 architecture [10] with standard SPARC instruction set architecture [11] could serve this purpose, implementing this would require:\n- Adding new decimal floating-point units\n- Developing new instructions\n- Creating software tools for generating and simulating binary code\n- Utilizing SPARC V9's IMPDEP1,2 for custom instructions\n\nOur work introduces an evaluation framework for software-hardware co-design of decimal computation using the RISC-V ecosystem [12]. This open-source environment encompasses:\n- RISC-V ISA\n- Rocket chip hardware implementation\n- RoCC (Rocket custom co-processor) interface\n- Multiple software and hardware development languages\n- Comprehensive verification and evaluation tools\n\nIn our proposed framework, co-design solutions are implemented as software supporting new decimal-oriented instructions, backed by a dedicated accelerator. Cycle-accurate analysis is achieved through RISC-V binary emulation on Rocket chip with the custom accelerator.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1.

        "Accurate estimation of object pose (translation and rotation) is crucial for autonomous robots to grasp and manipulate objects in an unstructured environment. Even small inaccuracies in the belief of the object pose can generate incorrect grasp configurations and lead to failures in manipulation tasks. Strategies based on vision sensors are commonly used for estimating the pose of the object, but there is residual uncertainty in the estimated pose due to incorrect calibration of the sensors, environmental conditions (occlusions, presence of extreme light, and low visibility conditions), and object properties (transparent, specular, reflective).\n\nTactile sensors in combination with robot proprioception provide high fidelity local measurements regarding object pose. However, mapping entire objects using tactile sensors is highly inefficient and time-consuming, which necessitates the use of active data collection for object pose estimation. Furthermore, due to the extremely low sparsity of the tactile data, novel techniques are required for performing pose estimation. Typical batch registration methods for pose estimation such as ICP or its variants have low performance when sparse data is available that arrive sequentially as is the case with tactile measurements. Hence, filter-based approaches are generally preferred for sequential data.\n\nA probabilistic method was proposed to perform registration given sparse point cloud, surface normal measurements, and the geometric model of the object. While tactile data can be collected in a randomized manner or driven by a human-teleoperator, active touch strategies that allow for autonomous data collection and reduction of redundant data collection are required. Several works have used information gain metric based on the uncertainty of the object's pose to determine the next best touching action to localize the object.\n\nIn the literature, the next best action selection is based on expected information gain via metrics such as Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, mutual information, and so on. However, a number of other related information theoretic metrics remain to be explored in the robotic domain. In this article, we empirically evaluate various information theoretic criteria for selecting the next best action in the context of tactile-based localization. We use our novel probabilistic translation-invariant Quaternion filter (TIQF) for pose estimation. TIQF decouples the estimation of rotation and translation and estimates rotation using a linear Kalman filter. We empirically evaluate the following criteria: (a) Kullback-Leibler divergence, (b) Shannon entropy, and (c) mutual information, to determine the most effective approach for tactile-based pose estimation.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nText-to-speech (TTS) technology aims to synthesize high-quality speech from written text [1]. As a crucial research direction in artificial intelligence (AI), TTS has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry [2]. Its applications span various domains, including navigation systems, public announcements, smart assistants, and other speech-enabled devices. With the advancement of deep learning technology, high-quality training data has become essential for developing reliable neural network models. Consequently, building a robust TTS system requires a high-quality speech dataset. While mainstream languages like Chinese and English benefit from extensive, high-quality speech databases such as LJSpeech [3], LibriTTS [4], and AiShell [5], low-resource languages like Mongolian face a scarcity of such data. To address this gap, we have developed MnTTS, an open-source speech dataset specifically designed for building high-quality Mongolian TTS systems.\n\nMongolian belongs to the Mongolian branch of the Altai language family and is the most prominent language within the Mongolian language family. It is primarily spoken in Mongolian-inhabited regions of China, Mongolia, and the Siberian Federal District of the Russian Federation. Additionally, it serves as the primary national language in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Globally, Mongolian has approximately 6 million speakers [6]. Recent government initiatives reflect a growing emphasis on expanding the Mongolian-speaking population through various language preservation programs. Therefore, advancing Mongolian speech synthesis technology holds significant importance for education, transportation, communication, and other sectors in ethnic minority regions. It's worth noting that while Mongolia primarily uses Cyrillic script [7] due to Soviet influence during the 1950s and 1960s, China predominantly uses traditional Mongolian script [8]. This paper focuses on the traditional script variant.\n\nCurrently, there is a notable absence of high-quality Mongolian speech datasets suitable for building TTS systems, particularly for implementing recent end-to-end (E2E) neural architectures [9]-[16], such as Tacotron [9] and Tacotron2 [13]. When combined with WaveNet-like vocoders, these models have achieved human-like pronunciation quality. To enhance inference speed, researchers have proposed non-autoregressive TTS models and vocoders, including FastSpeech [14], FastSpeech2 [15], MelGAN [17], VocGAN [18], and HiFi-GAN [19], all of which have demonstrated exceptional performance. Our work introduces the MnTTS dataset to address the lack of Mongolian language resources. To our knowledge, this represents the first open-source dataset specifically developed for Mongolian TTS systems. The dataset comprises approximately 8 hours of high-quality speech recorded by a 22-year-old professional female Mongolian announcer. Native transcribers carefully annotated the content, which covers various domains including politics, business, sports, and entertainment.",
        "**Revised Text:**\n\nSpoken language diarization (LD) involves the automatic extraction of monolingual segments from codeswitched (CS) utterances. While humans are the best language recognizers in the world [1]-[3], they rely on multiple levels of information\u2014both pre-lexical, such as acoustic-phonetic, phonotactic, prosodic, and lexical, like words and phrases\u2014to identify languages [1], [4]. Most current systems use acoustic-phonetic, phonotactic, and phoneme dynamics, which combine to form syllables/sub-words, for language recognition [1], [4]. The acoustic-phonetic information is derived from the spectro-temporal representation and captures the phoneme production mechanism [1], [4], while phonotactic information highlights language-specific phoneme distribution [1].\n\nExisting language recognition systems are broadly categorized into implicit and explicit models. Implicit systems extract language information directly from speech signals, whereas explicit systems model language through intermediate modeling of phonemes, Senones, tokens, etc. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. Explicit models require transcribed speech data and complicate system design [3], while implicit approaches struggle with capturing language-specific long-term dynamics directly from speech signals [5]-[7]. However, advancements in deep learning frameworks like recurrent neural networks (RNN), time-delay neural networks (TDNN), and transformers show promise in addressing these challenges [8]-[11].\n\nResearch indicates that humans can recognize languages without understanding grammatical details [2], motivating the exploration of implicit approaches for LD tasks. In CS utterances, usually spoken by a single speaker [5], [10], the phoneme production of secondary languages may be influenced by the primary language, complicating acoustic-phonetic discrimination. Fig. 1 illustrates the difficulty in distinguishing languages through time domain and spectrogram representations of a CS utterance (Hindi-English) and provides a language-specific distribution using MFCC+\u2206 + \u2206\u2206 features, posterior vectors extracted from wav2vec (W2V), and TDNN-based x-vector representations. The overlap between languages is noticeable in the MFCC feature space due to similar phoneme production, but this overlap reduces in the language-specific posterior and x-vector spaces, indicating the efficacy of both explicit and implicit systems.\n\nSeveral attempts in literature focus on LD and related tasks like CS point detection (CSD), CS utterance detection (CSUD), and sub-utterance level language identification (SLID) [7], [10], [13]. Some efforts equate SLID with LD by predicting language tags for fixed duration segments within an utterance [13]. Most approaches aim to capture phonotactic information or distribution to form syllables and words using either implicit or explicit methods. Studies [14], [15] have explored SLID and CSUD tasks using both approaches, noting that explicit methods often outperform implicit ones. However, implicit methods like Gaussian posterior and i-vector offer advantages, such as easier implementation, no need for intermediate phoneme modeling or transcribed data, and suitability for low-resource languages [3].\n\nSpeaker diarization (SD), a task similar to LD, is well-explored in the literature [20]-[22]. SD frameworks usually employ implicit approaches for speaker modeling [20], [22], suggesting a potential synergy between SD and LD studies. SD systems are categorized into feature-based segmentation followed by clustering, fixed segmentation with embedding-based clustering, and end-to-end (E2E) approaches [20]. Each framework has its pros and cons, inspiring the exploration of LD using fixed segmentation, change point-based segmentation, and E2E frameworks.\n\nStudies show that deriving language representation implicitly requires a larger analysis window and a priori language information [6], yet secondary language segments are typically brief, potentially diminishing diarization performance [7], [10]. Initial frameworks were developed and tuned with a synthetically generated dataset, balanced in primary and secondary language duration, before evaluation on practical datasets. Inspired by successes in other domains [26], the hypothesis is that self-supervised training of wav2vec (W2V) with unlabeled data, followed by fine-tuning with limited labeled data, can enhance language representation.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II details the databases used in this study. Section III discusses the proposed implicit LD frameworks, comparing their performance against explicit LD with synthetic data. Section IV evaluates these frameworks on practical datasets. Section V explores extracting self-supervised implicit representations. Section VI discusses initial hypotheses and results. Finally, Section VII concludes and outlines future directions.",

Many are intended to be part of a larger sociotechnical process involving human decision-makers. In these cases, in-domain accuracy alone cannot guarantee good outcomes\u2014the people using a particular system must also understand the model's reliability and modulate their trust appropriately [27, 57]. Model interpretability, which aims to provide insight into how ML models work, plays a crucial role in this understanding.\n\n## Current Challenges in Model Interpretability\nMany existing approaches to model interpretability require significant ML expertise, limiting their practical use primarily to ML developers [6]. While developer tools are necessary, the end users who make decisions based on model predictions often constitute a distinctly different group. Even supposedly simpler methods, such as reporting feature weights or displaying additional model and dataset information, have not demonstrated improved decision-making in experimental studies [9, 28, 36, 52, 61].\n\n## Proposed Solution: Visual Analytics Modules\nTo facilitate more intuitive assessment of model reliability, we introduce two visual analytics modules:\n\n### 1.

        "Time series forecasting remains a vital research area, directly addressing critical challenges for businesses, governments, and industries, including demand prediction (Lu et al., 2021), resource optimization (Xiang et al., 2021), traffic flow prediction (Zheng et al., 2021), and predictive maintenance (Arena et al., 2022).  Accurate future trend estimations can mitigate losses, boost profits, and enable effective planning and resource allocation. Consequently, significant emphasis has been placed on improving time series forecasting methods.\n\nRecently, data-driven machine learning (ML) methods, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), have achieved considerable success. DNNs excel at extracting useful features from data, demonstrating impressive performance in various domains, including time series forecasting (Cai et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2017), image segmentation and classification (Yuan et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2021), and natural language processing (Du et al., 2021). However, these networks often require vast training datasets to optimize their millions of parameters, a requirement frequently unmet in real-world applications. This dependence on large, accurately labeled datasets is a major DNN limitation, particularly for time series modeling. Even lengthy time series can contain limited data points for DNN training. For instance, a monthly time series spanning 20 years provides only 240 historical observations.  Consequently, complex deep networks are prone to overfitting in temporal forecasting, and their superiority, if any, is less pronounced than in other domains (Makridakis & Hibon, 2000; Makridakis et al., 2018).\n\nConversely, knowledge-driven systems (KDS) leverage human expertise for predictions, typically without relying on historical data.  A KDS usually comprises a knowledge base of problem-specific facts and manually defined rules, designed to capture expert knowledge and mimic human decision-making. KDS remains prevalent in risk-critical domains like healthcare (Zhang et al., 2019; Fernandes et al., 2018) and collision avoidance systems (Hagen et al., 2018).  For time series forecasting, KDS knowledge can take the form of if-then statements or arithmetic functions derived from statistical principles. While KDS minimizes reliance on data, formulating universally applicable rules is challenging.  Both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches offer distinct, complementary advantages. DNNs excel at data processing and feature extraction, while KDS effectively models underlying processes, performing well in data-scarce scenarios.  Relying solely on one approach can be suboptimal.\n\nA natural progression is combining DNNs and KDS. Hybrid schemes incorporating additional information with DNNs are increasingly common. However, most hybrid time series forecasting schemes rely on ensemble methods, combining separate systems post-prediction using weighted ensembles (Kaushik et al., 2020; Choi & Lee, 2018; Smyl, 2020) or statistical methods for preprocessing and feature extraction as DNN inputs (Tripathy & Acharya, 2018; Smyl, 2020). While these frameworks combine different domains, their performance is limited by available data.  Furthermore, an ideal fusion scheme should allow each domain to compensate for the other's weaknesses.  Knowledge distillation techniques (Hinton et al., 2015), operating in a teacher-student setting, are somewhat aligned with this objective.  Here, a student network mimics predictions from a teacher network (potentially a KDS or a more complex deep network). While knowledge distillation enhances the student network, it assumes the teacher network's accuracy.  It doesn't address scenarios with inaccurate or unreliable teacher network predictions, a common occurrence in KDS due to the difficulty of formulating comprehensive rules.\n\nRecognizing these limitations and the importance of accurate forecasting, we propose the Knowledge Enhanced Neural Network (KENN), a novel framework fusing KDS knowledge into DNNs for time series forecasting. KENN specifically mitigates DNN data dependency without requiring KDS accuracy.  It achieves this by incorporating KDS predictions within a residual scheme, allowing it to assess KDS efficacy and supplement missing knowledge with data-driven insights.  We demonstrate that KENN combines the strengths of both domains while mitigating their individual weaknesses, reducing DNN data dependency and accommodating limited or unreliable KDS knowledge. While our primary focus is developing an effective fusion scheme rather than proposing the best DNN or KDS model, we compare KENN with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.",
        "Knowledge distillation (KD) [Bucilu\u01ce et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015] is a popular method for compressing a large \"teacher\" model into a more compact \"student\" model. In its most basic form, this involves training the student to fit the teacher's predicted label distribution or soft labels for each sample. There is strong empirical evidence that distilled students usually perform better than students trained on raw dataset labels [Hinton et al., 2015; Furlanello et al., 2018; Stanton et al., 2021; Gou et al., 2021]. Multiple works have devised novel KD procedures that further improve student model performance (see Gou et al. [2021] and references therein).\n\nSeveral works have aimed to rigorously formalize why KD can improve the student model performance. Some prominent observations from this line of work are that (self-)distillation induces favorable optimization biases in the training objective [Phuong and Lampert, 2019; Ji and Zhu, 2020], lowers the variance of the objective [Menon et al., 2021; Dao et al., 2021; Ren et al., 2022], increases regularization towards learning \"simpler\" functions [Mobahi et al., 2020], transfers information from different data views [Allen-Zhu and Li, 2020], and scales per-example gradients based on the teacher's confidence [Furlanello et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2020].\n\nDespite this remarkable progress, there are still many open problems and unexplained phenomena around knowledge distillation. For instance, why do soft labels sometimes help? It is agreed that a teacher's soft predictions carry information about class similarities [Hinton et al., 2015; Furlanello et al., 2018], and that this softness of predictions has a regularization effect similar to label smoothing [Yuan et al., 2020]. Nevertheless, KD also works in binary classification settings with limited class similarity information [M\u00fcller et al., 2020]. How exactly the softness of teacher predictions (controlled by a temperature parameter) affects student learning remains far from well understood.\n\nAnother open problem is the role of the capacity gap. There is evidence that when there is a significant capacity gap between the teacher and the student, the distilled model usually falls behind its teacher [Mirzadeh et al., 2020; Cho and Hariharan, 2019; Stanton et al., 2021]. It is unclear whether this is due to difficulties in optimization or due to insufficient student capacity.\n\nMoreover, what makes a good teacher? Sometimes less accurate models are better teachers [Cho and Hariharan, 2019; Mirzadeh et al., 2020]. Furthermore, early-stopped or exponentially averaged models are often better teachers [Ren et al., 2022]. A comprehensive explanation of this remains elusive.\n\nThis paper provides a new theoretically grounded perspective on KD through the lens of supervision complexity. This concept quantifies why certain targets (e.g., temperature-scaled teacher probabilities) may be \"easier\" for a student model to learn compared to others (e.g., raw one-hot labels), owing to better alignment with the student's neural tangent kernel (NTK) [Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019]. Specifically, we provide a novel theoretical analysis (\u00a72, Thm. 3 and 4) of the role of supervision complexity on kernel classifier generalization and use this to derive a new generalization bound for distillation (Prop. 5). This highlights how student generalization is controlled by a balance of the teacher generalization, the student's margin with respect to the teacher predictions, and the complexity of the teacher's predictions.\n\nBased on this analysis, we establish the conceptual and practical efficacy of a simple online distillation approach (\u00a74), wherein the student is fit to progressively more complex targets, in the form of teacher predictions at various checkpoints during its training. This method guides the student in the function space (see Fig. 1) and leads to better generalization compared to offline distillation. We provide empirical results on a range of image classification benchmarks confirming the value of online distillation, particularly for students with weak inductive biases.\n\nBeyond practical benefits, the supervision complexity view yields new insights into distillation. For instance, temperature scaling and early-stopping of the teacher have proven effective for KD. We show that both techniques reduce supervision complexity, at the expense of also lowering the classification margin. Online distillation manages to smoothly increase teacher complexity without degrading the margin.\n\nFurthermore, for students with weak inductive biases and/or with much less capacity than the teacher, the final teacher predictions are often as complex as dataset labels, particularly during the early stages of training. In contrast, online distillation allows the supervision complexity to progressively increase, thus allowing even a weak student to learn.\n\nLastly, online distillation is highly effective at matching the teacher and student NTK matrices. This transfers relational knowledge in the form of example-pair similarity, as opposed to standard distillation, which only transfers per-example knowledge.\n\nIn the problem setting, we focus on classification problems from input domain X to d classes. We are given a training set of n labeled examples {(x\u2081, y\u2081), ..., (x\u2099, y\u2099)}, with one-hot encoded labels y\u1d62 \u2208 {0, 1}\u1d48. Typically, a model f_\u03b8: X \u2192 R\u1d48 is trained with the softmax cross-entropy loss:\nEQUATION\nwhere \u03c3(\u2022) is the softmax function. In standard KD, given a trained teacher model g: X \u2192 R\u1d48 that outputs logits, one trains a student model f_\u03b8: X \u2192 R\u1d48 to fit the teacher predictions. Hinton et al. [2015] propose the following KD loss:\nEQUATION\nwhere temperature \u03c4 > 0 controls the softness of teacher predictions. To highlight the effect of KD and simplify exposition, we assume that the student is not trained with the dataset labels.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is progressively becoming an integral part of our daily lives, emphasizing the need for transparent (Saxon et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2023) and responsible (Bergman and Diab, 2022) AI systems. An essential element in achieving transparency and building trust between such systems and users is the generation of natural language explanations (NLE) (Kumar and Talukdar, 2020). The NLEs play a crucial role in clarifying the reasoning behind AI decisions. As the significance of NLEs continues to grow, it has become increasingly important to evaluate the quality of these explanations (Yao et al., 2023a).\n\nTraditionally, evaluating NLEs has largely relied on gathering human judgments (Clinciu et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2023a). However, assessing text quality through human evaluation is a crucial yet intricate endeavor (van der Lee et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2023a), complicated by the inherently subjective nature of human text quality assessments (Yao et al., 2023a) and fine-grained ratings on a Likert scale (van der Lee et al., 2019). Additional challenges include eliminating unintended biases in question wording (Schoch et al., 2020) and participant recruitment (Kwak et al., 2022). These factors make human evaluation resource-intensive and time-consuming, suggesting the need for models capable of autonomously assessing explanation quality as a complement to human evaluations\u2014a critical step toward responsible AI systems (Chiang and Lee, 2023).\n\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as Instruct-GPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), offers a potential solution. These models have demonstrated remarkable ability in understanding natural language, leveraging extensive knowledge to outperform prior approaches in various tasks, including open-domain QA, document summarization, and mathematical reasoning (Qin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b; Bang et al., 2023). ChatGPT, in particular, has exhibited human-level competency in generating informative and clear NLEs, especially in contexts like hate speech detection (Huang et al., 2023b).\n\nWhile numerous studies have investigated LLMs' potential to replace or augment human annotations, they have primarily focused on classification tasks such as topic and stance detection (Yi Liaw et al., 2023; Gilardi et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023b). Less attention has been given to their ability to assign ratings or distinguish among ordinal categories\u2014the focus of our study.\n\nIn this research, we examine the alignment between ChatGPT's evaluation of explanation quality and human assessments using three distinct datasets: e-SNLI for logical reasoning (Camburu et al., 2018), LIAR-PLUS for misinformation justification (Alhindi et al., 2018), and Latent Hatred for implicit hate speech explanation (ElSherief et al., 2021). We engage human annotators and ChatGPT to assess human-written explanations, focusing on informativeness and clarity (Gatt and Krahmer, 2018; Howcroft et al., 2020; Clinciu et al., 2021) using a 7-point Likert scale.",
        "Understanding the relationships between somatic mutations in cancers is crucial for personalized treatments and patient classification. Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are often varied and sparse, where even two patients with the same cancer might share only one mutation out of thousands. To simplify these complex interactions, models are employed to summarize the high-dimensional data into a more manageable form. This necessitates a model that considers multiple confounding variables to elucidate the connections between somatic mutations. Current literature suggests that mutually exclusive and co-occurring mutations are influenced by nonlinear relationships between gene mutation frequencies, biological processes, cancer types, total number of mutations in a tumor (TML), and positive selection for mutations. However, dealing with multiple confounding variables and the sparse nature of somatic mutation data presents challenges in uncovering the underlying dependencies between mutations.\n\nStatistical and computational models that aim to reveal relationships between somatic mutations often break down a patient's mutation profile into higher-level structures that mirror known biological processes. This approach typically involves a random walk on an existing biological interaction network, represented as a graph (G = (V, E)), where vertices (V) denote genes and edges (E) indicate gene interactions. This network is then transformed into a weighted graph, with edge weights reflecting interaction probabilities and vertex weights indicating mutation frequencies in genes. By simulating a walk through this network based on these probabilities, a smaller subnetwork called a functional network is derived to represent altered biological processes. While functional networks have proven effective in identifying abnormal genes and pathways, they may lead to false positives due to underlying assumptions.\n\nA common resource for generating functional networks is the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), which details genetic pathways connecting genes based on their physical and biochemical characteristics. However, these networks primarily represent healthy individuals, and assuming they are cancer-relevant can limit their specificity to particular cancer types. Furthermore, functional networks rely on the concept of mutual exclusivity in somatic mutations, where mutations in the same genetic pathway tend not to occur together. Accounting for mutual exclusivity in functional networks is essential, although there are additional confounding factors influencing this phenomenon.\n\nPreprocessing somatic mutation data to a reduced set of mutations is a common practice, yet there is no standardized method for this. The high dimensionality of somatic mutation data and limited sample size can introduce bias towards frequently occurring mutations. Thus, while functional networks can identify novel co-occurring mutations, they might be influenced by the model's inherent preferences. This can lead to overfitting, where functional networks memorize interaction network parameters rather than learning from the somatic mutation dataset, potentially overlooking relevant cancer relationships.\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose leveraging the inherent structure of somatic mutation data using a generative probabilistic model. Instead of depending solely on interaction networks, we introduce a model based on a correlated random measure (CoRM), allowing us to capture mutual exclusivity and cancer-related biological processes. Our Correlated Zero Inflated Binomial Process (CoZ-INB) model aims to factorize somatic mutation profiles to identify positively and negatively correlated latent factors representing co-occurring mutations and biological processes.",
        "The large number of trainable parameters in deep neural networks imposes computational constraints on the information that can be made available to optimization algorithms. Standard machine learning libraries (Abadi et al., 2015; Paszke et al., 2019) mainly provide access to first-order information in the form of average mini-batch gradients. This limitation complicates the development of novel methods that may outperform the state-of-the-art. Consequently, this has led to stagnation in the performance of first-order optimizers (Schmidt et al., 2021).\n\nRecent advances in automatic differentiation (Bradbury et al., 2020; Dangel et al., 2020) have made higher-order derivatives and their distribution across the mini-batch more readily accessible. Leveraging and extending this functionality allows efficient access to curvature in the form of the Hessian's generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) approximation. This approximation offers practical advantages and is linked theoretically to the natural gradient method via the Fisher information matrix.\n\nTraditional ways to access curvature fall into two categories. Repeated automatic differentiation enables matrix-free exact multiplication with the Hessian and GGN, allowing for computations of Newton steps and spectral properties on arbitrary architectures. K-FAC constructs an explicit light-weight representation of the GGN based on its algebraic Kronecker structure, enabling scalability with large minibatches but sacrificing accuracy in certain applications.\n\nProposing VIVIT, a curvature model inspired by the low-rank structure of the GGN, allows for a flexible trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. VIVIT computes various GGN properties efficiently and introduces approximations for modeling curvature noise. The implementation is provided in PyTorch on top of the Backpack package, showcasing scalability and efficiency through benchmarks on different deep neural network architectures.\n\nThe main focus of this work is to demonstrate the efficient computation of various curvature properties, including uncertainty. The practical applications of curvature uncertainty are discussed in Section 5, with a particular emphasis on how the GGN is affected by noise during training.",
        "Telemedicine is an increasingly popular treatment method in the medical field due to its high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and safety. Compared to traditional medical care, telemedicine enhances treatment efficiency by facilitating prompt feedback between doctors and patients. It utilizes technologies like computer-aided pose assessment to provide precise and objective patient information, reducing the need for therapist supervision and in-person visits, thus cutting down on rehabilitation costs. Additionally, telemedicine provides opportunities for individuals with limited mobility or disabilities to receive care at home, reducing the risk of exposure to unhygienic conditions and infections.\n\nIn order to deliver remote services effectively, certain constraints need to be met, such as optimizing computing power on personal devices, ensuring high precision, and achieving real-time performance. For instance, an attention cube is introduced in Fig. 1 to enclose the target and gray points represent attention points on each surface, with darker colors indicating higher weights.\n\nTelemedicine finds extensive application in predicting movement disorders, diagnosing movement disorders, and sports rehabilitation training. Human pose estimation (HPE) plays a crucial role in reconstructing the 3D human body skeleton for these purposes. While sensor-based methods have limitations like requiring attachment to the patient's body, learning-based HPE technology, driven by advancements in deep learning and computer vision, offers a non-contact and easily calibrated alternative. To address the accuracy and latency issues of existing methods, a novel Attention Cube Regression Network (ACRNet) has been proposed to provide a unified and efficient network for multi-view depth image-based estimation work.\n\nACRNet revolutionizes the estimation process by utilizing an attention cube to gather information from all surfaces and estimate the 3D positions of human joints, improving accuracy and efficiency. By integrating feature maps from various viewpoints and utilizing dynamic weights based on cross similarity, the network achieves precise joint position regression. This approach ensures that informative attention points are emphasized while less relevant points are disregarded for accurate results.\n\nValidation tests on the ITOP dataset showcase ACRNet's superior performance compared to existing methods in front-view settings, with comparable results in top-view settings. The model also boasts high running speeds, achieving 92.3 FPS on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, enabling real-time operation. Furthermore, a new medical multi-view upper body movement dataset (UBM) from healthy subjects was collected and assessed, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing baselines. Overall, ACRNet emerges as a fully differentiable multi-view regression network tailored for telemedicine, enhancing the estimation of 3D human joint positions.",
        "Interval methods have long been a significant approach to time series classification. Most of these methods are remarkably similar, adhering closely to a paradigm established by Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2000) and Geurts (2001). They involve computing various descriptive statistics and other features over multiple subseries of an input time series or transformations of it (e.g., first difference or discrete Fourier transform). These features are then used to train a classifier, typically an ensemble of decision trees (e.g., Deng et al., 2013; Lines et al., 2018). This straightforward approach to time series classification is appealing (see Middlehurst and Bagnall, 2022; Henderson et al., 2023).\n\nInterestingly, we have found that it is possible to achieve the same average accuracy as the most precise existing interval methods simply by sorting the values in each interval and using the sorted values as features. To reduce the size of the feature space and the computational cost, one can subsample these sorted values, i.e., use the quantiles of the values in the intervals as features. We call this approach Quant.\n\nThe difference in mean accuracy and the pairwise win/draw/loss between Quant and several prominent interval methods\u2014specifically, TSF (Deng et al., 2013), STSF (Cabello et al., 2020), rSTSF (Cabello et al., 2021), CIF (Middlehurst et al., 2020), and DrCIF (Middlehurst et al., 2021b)\u2014for a subset of 112 datasets from the UCR archive (for which published results are available for all methods) are displayed in the Multiple Comparison Matrix (MCM) in Figure 1 (see Ismail-Fawaz et al., 2023). Results for the other methods are taken from Middlehurst et al. (2023). As shown in Figure 1, Quant achieves higher accuracy on more datasets and a higher mean accuracy than existing interval methods. The total compute time for Quant is significantly less than even the fastest of these methods (see further details below).\n\nWhen using quantiles (or sorted values) as features, altering the interval length allows us to transition between two extremes: (a) a single interval where the quantiles (or sorted values) represent the distribution of the values over the entire time series (distributional information without location information), and (b) intervals of length one, which together consist of all the values in the time series in their original order (location information without distributional information), as illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nQuantiles encompass a broader range of features than many existing interval methods (e.g., min, max, median). By adjusting the number of quantiles per interval, we can easily increase or decrease the number of features, thus balancing accuracy and computational cost. We find that quantiles can be employed with fixed (non-random) intervals without any explicit interval or feature selection process, using an 'off-the-shelf' classifier\u2014particularly extremely randomized trees (Geurts et al., 2006), as suggested by Cabello et al. (2021).\n\nThe primary advantages of distilling interval methods down to these essential components are simplicity and computational efficiency. Quant represents one of the fastest methods for time series classification. The cost of computing the quantiles is particularly low; the median transform time over 142 datasets in the UCR archive is less than one second.",
        "Automatic segmentation and classification of medical images are crucial in diagnosing, predicting growth, and treating brain tumors. Early diagnosis of brain tumors enables a quicker treatment response, improving patient survival rates. Manually locating and classifying brain tumors in extensive medical image databases, routinely collected in clinical settings, is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an automatic detection, localization, and classification process is highly desirable and valuable [1].\n\nSeveral medical imaging techniques are employed to gather information about tumors, such as tumor type, shape, size, and location, which are essential for diagnosis [2]. The most significant techniques include Computed Tomography (CT), Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). These techniques can be combined for more detailed tumor information. However, MRI is the most commonly used technique due to its advantageous characteristics. MRI scans provide hundreds of 2D image slices with high soft tissue contrast without using ionizing radiation [2]. There are four MRI modalities used in diagnosis: T1-weighted MRI (T1), T2-weighted MRI (T2), T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (T1-CE), and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). Each modality produces images with different tissue contrasts, making some more suitable for identifying specific tissue types. T1 is typically used for healthy tissues, T2 for detecting edema region borders, T1-CE for highlighting tumor borders, and FLAIR for detecting edema regions in cerebrospinal fluid [3]. Given that the goal of MRI image processing is to locate and classify brain tumors, the T1-CE modality is adequate and, as demonstrated in this paper, sufficient.\n\nIn recent decades, Brain Tumor Imaging (BTI) has grown exponentially. Specifically, the number of studies on brain tumor quantification using MRI images has increased significantly [2]. Brain Tumor Segmentation (BTS) involves distinguishing tumor-infected tissues from healthy ones. In many BTS applications, segmentation is achieved by classifying pixels, turning the segmentation problem into a classification task [4].\n\nThis paper aims to develop and test a Deep Learning approach for brain tumor classification and segmentation using a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network. A T1-CE MRI image dataset from 233 patients, including meningiomas, gliomas, and pituitary tumors in sagittal, coronal, and axial views, was used to train and test the proposed neural model [5]. Figure 1 shows examples of these three tumor types. Additional dataset information is provided in Section 2.2. Our model can segment and predict the pathological type of the three brain tumor types, outperforming previous studies using the same dataset. In the BTS field, two main tumor segmentation approaches exist: generative and discriminative. Generative approaches use explicit anatomical models for segmentation, while discriminative methods learn image features and their relationships using expert segmentations as a gold standard [2]. Published studies following the discriminative approach have evolved from classical Machine Learning [6] [7] [8] [9] to more recent Deep Learning techniques [10] [11] [12] [13] [14].\n\nIn studies using classical Machine Learning techniques, the segmentation pipeline includes a preprocessing stage for feature extraction. For example, Sachdeva et al. [6] developed a semi-automatic system to obtain the tumor contour, computing 71 features using the intensity profile, co-occurrence matrix, and Gabor functions. Skull stripping is a common preprocessing stage in classical discriminative approaches, though it has drawbacks such as parameter selection, the need for prior image information, and high computational time [15]. The extracted features serve as input for classification or segmentation.",
        "In the field of robot vision, the performance of object detectors has dramatically improved since the adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction.  Well-known detectors like SSD [20], YOLO [22], RetinaNet [19], Faster R-CNN [23], and Mask R-CNN [14] typically operate on single images.  When applied to video, the traditional approach involves per-frame detection followed by object tracking to associate detections across frames. However, this method fails to leverage temporal information inherent in video sequences, limiting detection performance.  Furthermore, video often suffers from degraded image quality due to motion blur, defocusing, unusual poses, and occlusions.  This inconsistency burdens object trackers and necessitates detectors designed to exploit temporal information for robust performance.\n\nRecently, video object detectors (VoDs) have emerged, utilizing multiple consecutive frames for detection [2, 3, 6, 12, 27-29]. Some methods [2, 12, 28, 29] fuse CNN feature maps to enhance object representation. Others [3, 6, 27] associate object proposals across frames and fuse the associated features to improve quality.  Still others [8, 26] exploit object motion and camera variations to extract representations of moving objects.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel VoD algorithm called Temporal Feature Aggregation and Motion-aware VoD (TM-VoD).  TM-VoD constructs robust object features using finite-length image sequences.  Our design pursues two key objectives: First, aggregating common yet diverse object representations across multiple frames, adapting to temporal variations in feature location and quality. Second, exploiting temporal motion patterns to derive rich, discriminative representations, recognizing that different object classes exhibit distinct motion cues.\n\nTM-VoD detects objects using *M* past frames, *N* future frames, and the present frame (illustrated in Figure 1 with *N* = *M* = 2).  It first fuses visual feature maps from CNN backbone networks. To maximize aggregation effectiveness, TM-VoD performs two-stage alignment and weighting.  Pixel-level gated feature aggregation weights CNN feature maps based on their relevance to the detection task. Subsequently, region proposal network (RPN) proposals undergo Temporal Box Offset Calibration (TBOC) alignment and weighting based on cosine similarity between present and adjacent frame features.  TM-VoD also extracts object motion representation in two stages. Pixel-level motion features capture incremental changes in adjacent visual feature maps. Box-level motion features are derived from RoI-aligned motion features and corresponding box coordinate sequences. Finally, temporally aggregated features and box-level motion features merge to create a joint object representation. The entire network is end-to-end trainable.\n\nOur key contributions are:\n\n* We propose TM-VoD, exploiting both temporal redundancy in object features and contextual information from object motion. We focus on aggregating relevant, well-aligned visual feature map regions, extracting effective motion representations, and integrating them into VoD. Feature aggregation and motion feature extraction occur hierarchically at both pixel and box levels.\n* We introduce an efficient box regression method for aligning box proposals across frames. Instead of associating all proposal pairs across adjacent frames [3, 6, 27], our method uses initial RPN proposals as anchors and predicts box offsets relative to these anchors for all frames.\n* We evaluate TM-VoD on the ImageNet VID dataset [24].  Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline algorithms.  Furthermore, TM-VoD outperforms existing VoD methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art.\n* The source code will be publicly available.",
        "To create safe and efficient mobile robots, it is essential to incorporate introspective and reliability-aware capabilities that can assess and recover from perception failures. Many perception tasks, such as localization, scene understanding, and sensor calibration, rely on point cloud registration. However, registration can yield incorrect estimates due to several factors, including local minima of the registration cost function, uncompensated motion distortion, noise, or when the registration problem is geometrically under-constrained. Therefore, it is crucial to measure the quality of alignment and to reject or re-estimate alignment when the quality is low.\n\nHistorically, numerous methods have been developed to assess the alignment quality of point cloud pairs. These metrics typically measure the relative alignment error during the registration process, yet they provide limited information on the correctness of the alignment once registration is complete. To date, few studies have focused on the measurement of alignment correctness after registration, and previous research indicates that alignment correctness, when classified using the AdaBoost and the NDT score function, decreases when applied to point clouds from new, unseen environments.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce \"CorAl\" (Correctly Aligned?): a method to introspectively measure and detect misalignment between previously registered point cloud pairs, specifically aiming to improve classification performance in new, unseen environments. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides an intuitive measure of alignment correctness. CorAl evaluates the difference between the average differential entropy of the joint and the separate point clouds, with the expectation that, for well-aligned point clouds, the entropy of the joint and the separate point clouds is similar.",
        "Here's the restructured text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\nLegged robots have increasingly become capable of robust locomotion and navigating over unstructured terrain. A major advantage of legged locomotion is an ability to traverse terrain which contains obstacles, gaps or other challenges intractable to wheeled or tracked platforms. For many real-world applications of legged platforms, it is a requirement that such terrain can be navigated with a high degree of autonomy. While there has been significant work towards this goal, finding a robust and operational solution to humanoid path planning remains an open problem. Path planning for legged robots requires reasoning about the platform's capabilities and can be difficult to deploy when combined with practical limitations such as sensor noise.\n\nThis paper presents a navigation path planner designed to enable humanoid locomotion over rough terrain and is intended to be used as a heuristic for a lower-level footstep planner. Our approach first performs an A* search over a 2.5D height map by sampling terrain in the vicinity of each node to measure traversability. This initial path is then optimized using gradient descent in order to smooth the path while further improving its quality.\n\nWe build on the approach of many existing planners and perform a sample-based graph search which includes a traversability cost model [1] [2] [3]. The main contribution of our formulation is setting up the planner to use these traversability costs in a way that reflects the bipedal gait. Additionally, we include checks to prevent cutting corners, maintain a safe distance from obstacles and find reliable routes for ascending and descending terrain.\n\nWe select A* for a few reasons, the first being that our cost functions are sample-based and preclude the use of a closed-form solver. The second is for the practical reason that the A* planning process lends itself to logging and visualization more than randomized or probabilistic graph-search approaches. The planner is tested extensively using real sensor data on a variety of terrains containing stairs, stepping stones, ramps, cinder blocks and large obstacles (Fig. 1).",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nNeural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) have emerged as an efficient framework for addressing various machine learning challenges [4], [5]. The concept of NODEs arose from the observation that traditional residual neural networks can be interpreted as discretized solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where each \"layer\" represents a single time step in the discretization, and \"depth\" corresponds to the integration time length. NODEs build upon this implied ODE model, treating the ODE solution as the hidden state. In this framework, a forward pass through the network is computed via an ODE solver, while backpropagation is achieved by integrating an appropriate adjoint equation backward in time. NODEs have proven to be both time and memory-efficient models for various regression and classification tasks [4], [5].\n\nOur research introduces a novel continuous-time neural network approach based on delay differential equations (DDEs). The mathematical structure of DDEs differs fundamentally from that of ODEs [6], resulting in phenomena that ODE models often struggle to represent accurately. Recent advances in developing Neural DDEs (NDDEs)\u2014the DDE counterpart of NODEs\u2014have shown promising results [2], [18], [19]. Studies by [18] and [19] demonstrate that NDDEs can successfully learn models from time series data that remain beyond the capabilities of standard NODEs, including specific classification tasks.\n\nOur work advances the research presented in [2], [18], and [19] in several significant ways. While [18] assumes prior knowledge of the magnitude delay and cannot learn it as a parameter, our approach derives an adjoint equation through sensitivity analysis of our NDDE model, enabling the learning of delays from data. This enhancement significantly broadens the model's applicability as a system identification tool, particularly valuable when exact delay values are unknown in practical applications.\n\nNumerous dynamic processes exist whose evolution depends not only on their current state but also on previous states\u2014systems ideally modeled by delay differential equations. These systems span diverse fields: computer networks experience delays in information packet transmission [17]; gene expression dynamics involve delays due to messenger RNA's genetic code copying and macromolecule transport [3]; and population dynamics incorporate delays reflecting species' reproductive maturity timing [11]. Additionally, engineering applications deliberately utilize delays as control mechanisms, as evidenced in machine tool vibrations [9], automotive powertrains [8], gantry crane oscillations [12], and various other applications.\n\nThe primary contribution of this paper lies in our proposed novel algorithm for learning both the delay and parameters of unknown underlying DDEs based on trajectory data observations. Our methodology centers on the adjoint sensitivity method (illustrated in Fig. 2), detailed in Sec. III-A. We present a PyTorch implementation of the algorithm outlined in Sec. III, with the corresponding code provided at the section's conclusion. Section IV demonstrates our approach's effectiveness through illustrative examples.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, enhanced for clarity and flow while maintaining the core content:\n\nRecent advances in image generation have witnessed transformative developments, particularly in text-to-image diffusion models trained on extensive datasets. Stable Diffusion, an open-source model [43], has emerged as a standout innovation, democratizing image generation from textual prompts for a broad user base. This progress has significantly impacted various domains, notably the fashion industry with its substantial market presence.\n\nIn fashion, virtual try-on technology\u2014which superimposes garments onto user images [13, 20, 29, 41, 56, 62]\u2014has been revolutionized by diffusion models. These models achieve unprecedented levels of photorealism that surpass traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. They excel not only in generating realistic images but also in preserving intricate details while maintaining a natural appearance.\n\nHowever, existing methods face notable limitations beyond conventional virtual try-on applications. Garment merchants seek cost-effective solutions for creating diverse product visuals, including posters and display images. This creates two primary demands: first, the ability to quickly modify models, poses, atmospheres, and backgrounds through textual prompts or reference conditions; and second, the need for accurate representation of textures and fabric dynamics. While Stable Diffusion's adaptability shows promise, and recent advances in virtual try-on applications [29] demonstrate its potential, previous works have not fully leveraged its capabilities in text-to-image and stylized image creation, particularly in preserving complete patterns such as stripes and text.\n\nCombining detailed garment representation with Stable Diffusion's adaptability could benefit merchants, consumers, and artists by reducing creative costs and improving commercial effectiveness. This raises a crucial question: How can we generate images from text prompts or control conditions while preserving intricate garment details? We address this through Garment-Centric (GC) Generation, an approach focused on maintaining garment fidelity while enabling flexible image creation.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, we present StableGarment, a unified framework built on Stable Diffusion. The framework features a garment encoder designed to capture target garment details, interfacing with the Stable Diffusion denoising UNet through an innovative additive self-attention (ASA) mechanism. This enhancement improves the system's versatility in text prompting and model switching, while the self-attention approach facilitates model adaptability for creative try-on purposes. We also incorporate a try-on controlnet trained to superimpose garments onto input images based on user poses and image contexts. Furthermore, our restructured training dataset, enriched with diverse text prompts, enhances the generated images' adherence to prompts.\n\nOur key contributions include:\n\n1. A unified framework addressing garment-centric generation tasks, including GC text-to-image, controllable GC text-to-image, stylized GC text-to-image, and virtual try-ons within a single model.\n\n2.",
        "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed to exploit the inherent properties of natural images, particularly local neighborhood correlation and feature equivariance.  Standard CNNs rely on learned convolutional filters, fine-tuned to the available data. However, using preset filter banks can be advantageous, especially with limited training data [1].  Preset filters can mitigate overfitting and reduce computational complexity. Scattering networks, for example, utilize preset wavelet-based filters and have achieved state-of-the-art results in handwritten digit recognition and texture classification [2].\n\nWe propose replacing standard CNN convolutional operations with harmonic blocks. These blocks learn weighted sums of responses to Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) filters, as illustrated in Figure 1. DCT, successfully employed in JPEG encoding, transforms image blocks into spectral representations, capturing maximal information with few coefficients. Leveraging the frequency separation and energy compaction properties of DCT, our proposed harmonic networks combine responses from window-based DCT filters with a small receptive field.  The method learns the optimal combination of spectral coefficients at each layer, producing a fixed-size representation as a weighted sum of responses to these DCT filters.  Using DCT filters allows us to represent and regularize filter parameters directly in the DCT domain, simplifying model compression. While other works [3, 4] have explored convolutional filter decomposition into basis functions, they primarily focus on network compression. Our study demonstrates that prior information from a well-chosen filter basis not only facilitates compression but also accelerates training convergence and improves performance.\n\nBuilding upon our previous work [5, 1], this paper makes several contributions. First, we demonstrate that the theoretical computational overhead of the optimized harmonic block formulation is minimal (experimentally, within 3-7%), while memory footprint requirements are comparable to benchmark architectures using standard convolutional blocks (and are lower with harmonic block compression). Second, we significantly expand experimental validation, demonstrating consistent performance gains with harmonic blocks.  Specifically, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the small NORB dataset and show how DCT-based harmonic blocks enable efficient generalization to unseen lighting conditions.  Furthermore, we report quantitative and qualitative results for object detection and instance/semantic segmentation, observing a consistent average improvement of 1% AP, highlighting the practical benefits of harmonic networks.  Section 2 reviews relevant background research, leading to our harmonic network formulation (Section 3).  Extensive validation against state-of-the-art alternatives is presented for image classification (Section 4) and object detection, instance, and semantic segmentation (Section 5).  All our architectures are denoted as \"Harm.\"  PyTorch implementations are publicly available at https://github.com/matej-ulicny/harmonic-networks.",
        "Semantic segmentation of point clouds has become increasingly important.  Building upon the success of 2D image recognition (Long, Shelhamer, and Darrell 2015; Chen et al. 2017), many works have attempted to directly extend 2D convolutional networks to 3D space (Maturana and Scherer 2015; Zhou and Tuzel 2018). However, these methods are limited by a drastic increase in computational complexity.  Alternatively, PointNet (Qi et al. 2017a) utilized shared multi-layer perceptrons to directly process point clouds and aggregate information through max-pooling. However, it failed to exploit local relationships between points. Due to the uneven distribution of points and the irregularity of their representation, semantic segmentation of point clouds remains a challenging task.\n\nBoundaries play a crucial role in semantic segmentation, as many misclassifications occur near boundary points. In a point cloud, a boundary refers to the transition area between two or more objects of different categories. For example, the junction of a sofa and the floor can be considered a boundary.  Many works (Wang et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018; Wu, Qi, and Fuxin 2019) have addressed point cloud segmentation without explicitly learning or using boundary information. Consequently, they extract features without differentiating between boundary and non-boundary points.  Critically, features extracted on boundaries are often ambiguous, as they mix features from points belonging to different categories on either side. As the network deepens, if other points incorporate these ambiguous boundary features, the ambiguity propagates hierarchically, spreading information across boundaries and leading to poor contour delineation in the final segmentation.\n\nTo address this, we propose a Boundary Prediction Module (BPM) to predict boundary points. This module provides a soft boundary prediction and is supervised by dynamically generated ground truth. Boundary prediction is simpler than semantic segmentation and likely to yield better results. Therefore, we introduce the lightweight BPM to predict boundaries and use these predictions as auxiliary information to enhance segmentation performance. The BPM and the segmentation network are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Figure 1 illustrates predicted boundaries in several scenes, demonstrating accurate localization between different categories and visually reflecting the BPM's effectiveness.\n\nBased on the BPM, we design a boundary-aware Geometric Encoding Module (GEM) to utilize the predicted boundary information during feature extraction.  When aggregating local features, we restrict information sharing within object areas, preventing feature propagation across boundaries.  Mixing local features from different categories would destroy detailed information.  In subsequent encoder layers, where representative points are sampled and global features are encoded, information from different categories can transfer across boundaries to capture global scene information.  Thus, the predicted boundary acts as a barrier, preventing unwanted mixing during local feature aggregation while allowing information flow for global context.\n\nTo effectively exploit geometric information, we also design a lightweight Geometric Convolution Operation (GCO) that complements the boundary-aware GEM. The GCO focuses on the angular distribution of neighbors rather than the spatial distribution used in KCNet (Shen et al. 2018) and KPConv (Thomas et al. 2019), which are sensitive to point density and lack generalization.",
        "Automatic facial behavior analysis has long been a topic of interest at the intersection of computer vision, physiology, and psychology, with applications spanning a wide range of fields, including medicine, health, driver fatigue monitoring, e-learning, marketing, entertainment, lie detection, and law enforcement. However, it is only recently, with the advent of large-scale datasets and powerful machine learning methods like deep neural networks, that automatic facial behavior analysis has truly begun to flourish.\n\nWhen it comes to automatically recognizing affect in-the-wild (i.e., in uncontrolled conditions and unconstrained environments), there are three iconic tasks: (i) recognizing basic expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and the neutral state); (ii) estimating continuous affect (valence - how positive or negative a person is - and arousal - how active or passive a person is); and (iii) detecting facial action units (coding of facial motion concerning the activation of facial muscles, e.g., upper/inner eyebrows, nose wrinkles).\n\nEkman [11] defined the six basic emotions\u2014anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and the neutral state\u2014based on a cross-cultural study, which indicated that humans perceive certain basic emotions similarly, regardless of culture. Nevertheless, advanced research in neuroscience and psychology has argued that the model of six basic emotions is culture-specific and not universal. Moreover, the affect model based on basic emotions is limited in its ability to represent the complexity and subtlety of our daily affective displays. Despite these findings, the categorical model describing emotions in terms of discrete basic emotions remains the most popular perspective for expression recognition, due to its pioneering investigations and the straightforward, intuitive definition of facial expressions.\n\nThe dimensional model of affect, which is suitable for representing both extreme and subtle emotions occurring in everyday human-computer interactions, has also garnered significant attention in recent years. According to this dimensional approach [12, 65, 55], affective behavior is described by a number of latent continuous dimensions. The most commonly used dimensions include valence (indicating how positive or negative an emotional state is) and arousal (measuring the intensity of emotional activation).\n\nDetection of Facial Action Units (AUs) has also attracted considerable attention. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) [11, 2] provides a standardized taxonomy of facial muscle movements and has been widely adopted as a common standard for systematically categorizing the physical manifestation of complex facial expressions.",

For instance, what researchers consider \"fun\" may differ significantly from a kindergartner's perspective. Theories from sociolinguistics, pragmatics, and communication studies demonstrate how sociocultural background shapes interpersonal interaction (Schramm, 1954). This variation occurs across multiple dimensions, including:\n\n- Class (Bernstein, 2003; Thomas, 1983)\n- Age (Labov, 2011)\n- Gender (Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2013)\n- Race (Green, 2002)\n\n## Research Context\n\nThe board game Codenames Duet provides an ideal controlled environment for studying turn-based word reference between two players. The gameplay involves:\n\n1. The Clue Giver providing a single-word clue\n2. The Guesser interpreting this clue to select intended word references on the game board\n\nOptimal inferences emerge from the players' common ground\u2014their shared beliefs and knowledge (Clark, 1996). However, individual players' behaviors often reflect their unique knowledge and experiences, leading to potential misinterpretations when players' backgrounds differ (as illustrated in Figure 1).\n\n## Research Approach\n\nWe model sociocultural factors in pragmatic inference through:\n\n1. The CULTURAL CODES dataset: A collection of cross-cultural Codenames Duet gameplay, including players' demographics, personalities, and political and moral values (\u00a73)\n2. Deconstructing gameplay actions into distinct modeling tasks, informed by cross-cultural pragmatics research (\u00a74)\n3.

The CULTURAL CODES dataset aims to examine how measurable social factors influence dyadic communication in English, specifically focusing on how these factors affect linguistic reasoning in collaborative reference games.*",
        "The global e-scooter market was valued at 20.87 million USD in 2021 and is expected to grow rapidly. The efficiency and relatively low cost of e-scooters have contributed to their swift emergence and expansion in major cities worldwide. Some research has explored interactions between vehicles and cyclists, which share certain similarities with e-scooters. However, due to the unique dynamics of e-scooters\u2014such as sharing roads with mobile vehicles and having unpredictable movements\u2014it has been found that e-scooter crash characteristics do not fully align with bicycle crashes. The presence of e-scooters can be hazardous, especially if riders do not adhere to regulations. According to a safety report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), there has been an increase in the use of e-scooters and e-bikes, as well as a rise in fatalities and injuries among their riders. Research by Shah et al. found that approximately 10% of e-scooter and vehicle crashes result in injuries or fatalities to e-scooter riders. Thus, understanding the interactions between vehicles and e-scooters is crucial for traffic safety analysis and can be extended to future connected and automated vehicles (CAVs).\n\nReal-life scenarios also highlight the potential for collisions between e-scooters and vehicles. Various circumstances make the interaction between e-scooters and vehicles critical for safety analysis. Real-life traffic data, as illustrated in Figure 1, showcases such situations. In Figure 1(a), an e-scooter attempts to cross an intersection by navigating between two parked vehicles to reach the opposite side. However, a moving vehicle may enter the intersection simultaneously. In Figure 1(b), an e-scooter plans to change lanes to reach its destination, while a vehicle approaches from behind. Both scenarios are highly risky and could lead to severe consequences. \n\nTo address this, a method to study e-scooter behavior and the interactions between e-scooters and vehicles is needed. Simulation-based experiments offer an efficient means to conduct risk assessments and gain insights to enhance traffic safety. The main contributions of this work are as follows:\n\n1. A simulation-based framework to study e-scooter and vehicle interaction (VEI) scenarios.  \n2.",
        "Highly constrained problems are at the core of a wide variety of different applications (e.g. scheduling, hardware verification, or robotic manipulation planning). To robustly tackle such problems, they are represented as constrained optimization or satisfaction problems, and one aims to find a diverse set of feasible solutions.\n\nFocusing on problems in continuous domains, there are two main approaches to generate solutions. The first is to use a nonlinear solver to generate a joint assignment for all variables simultaneously. However, joint optimization is sensitive to the initial guess and prone to converging to infeasible points or the same local optima, especially in highly nonlinear problems. The second approach involves decomposing the problem by sequentially assigning subsets of variables. Yet, this method is often impractical due to joint constraints on variables. Defining dedicated constraint manifold sampling operations and a sampling order requires a deep understanding of the problem domain. While defining good decompositions works for simple or structured settings, it is suboptimal for complex scenarios.\n\nIn this work, we present an algorithm that efficiently generates a diverse set of solutions for high-dimensional nonlinear programs with many infeasible local optima. Our method leverages the factored structure of the problem and the factored graph representation of the task. This allows us to reason online about the best sequence of constrained conditional sampling operations, thereby optimizing for success rate and computation time.\n\nOur approach focuses on problems in robotic sequential manipulation, which involve finding feasible solutions satisfying kinematic and dynamic constraints imposed by the robot and the environment, potentially influenced by future actions and goals. These problems encode discrete structures due to mode-switches representing contact or kinematic changes. By generating a diverse set of feasible mode-switches and optimizing trajectories considering the entire set, we can address infeasibility and suboptimality issues encountered with a single mode-switching sequence.\n\nFor example, in a pick-and-place problem, with robot configurations, joint values, and relative transformations, different sampling sequences can be used to generate a full sample, such as jointly optimizing all variables, sampling the relative transformation first, and then computing robot configurations, or computing the pick configuration and relative transformation first, and then the place configuration.\n\nOur main contributions include a new framework for modeling constrained conditional sampling in constraint graphs and computation operations as a stochastic decision process, pruning strategies that reduce the possible computations based on the factored constraint graph representation, and an algorithm using Monte-Carlo Tree Search to find sequences of computational operations that maximize generated solutions within a fixed computational time.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# Syntax and Natural Language Understanding: A Critical Analysis\n\nIs syntactic understanding a prerequisite for natural language comprehension in AI models? While recent studies on large language models suggest this hypothesis (Devlin et al., 2019; Tenney et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2021), the evidence remains inconclusive. Surprisingly, models using only bag-of-words features have repeatedly matched the performance of syntax-aware models (Iyyer et al., 2015; Joulin et al., 2017). This has led to questions about whether current natural language understanding benchmarks are sufficiently challenging to demonstrate the importance of sentence structure (McCoy et al., 2019; Niven and Kao, 2019).\n\nWhile syntax is fundamental to language (Chomsky, 1965), with word order potentially altering meaning dramatically (as illustrated in Figure 1), we must ask: How crucial is syntactic structure in typical English usage? If we can accurately reconstruct word order from an unordered set of words, this suggests that word order may contribute less unique information than previously assumed.\n\n```\nThe scared mouse chased the hungry cat.\nThe hungry cat chased the scared mouse.\nFigure 1: Demonstrating how word order affects meaning\n```\n\nHistorically, this question proved challenging for linguists to address empirically. Manual word ordering was impractical, and there was no systematic way to choose between multiple grammatically valid arrangements.\n\nModern large language models now allow us to approach this as a computational problem: given a set of words, we can determine the most probable ordering according to a trained language model.\n\nTo solve this computational challenge, we developed Inference by Iterative Shuffling (IBIS), a novel approach inspired by combinatorial optimization that outperforms existing methods. Using IBIS, we conducted a comprehensive analysis that:\n\n1. Measured the frequency of permutable sentences and phrases across various genres\n2. Evaluated the impact of word order on GLUE benchmark performance (Wang et al., 2018) and autoregressive language modeling\n\nOur findings reveal that while random word reordering diminishes model performance across most tasks, using LM-informed word ordering results in minimal or no performance degradation. This suggests that NLP systems can effectively process unordered word sets, and word order may carry less semantic weight than previously thought.\n\nThese insights have significant implications for language modeling. The ability to efficiently search for optimal word order opens new possibilities for content-focused models, potentially enabling various constrained generation applications.\n\n[Figure 2 description remains unchanged as it appears to be a specific example of the IBIS algorithm in action]",
        "Hate speech is a widely used term lacking a universally agreed-upon definition.  Often understood as attacks targeting individuals or groups based on inherent traits, its subjective and contextual nature leaves interpretation open to individual users, media platforms (Meta, 2022; Twitter, 2022; Youtube, 2022; Microsoft, 2022b), and research groups (Djuric et al., 2015; Saleem et al., 2017; Mondal et al., 2017; Salminen et al., 2018; Jaki and De Smedt, 2019; Pereira-Kohatsu et al., 2019; Rani et al., 2020; R\u00f6ttger et al., 2021). This ambiguity makes it particularly challenging to distinguish hate speech from toxic speech or even humor employing irony, sarcasm, or euphemisms.  Furthermore, definitions can be fluid (Vengattil and Culliford, 2022).\n\nThis inherent ambiguity poses significant challenges to building robust hate speech classifiers. While large tech companies possess the resources to develop and maintain their own systems, smaller companies and media outlets face significant hurdles.  They often lack the in-house expertise and resources, and data protection regulations restrict sharing data with commercial services.  The Swiss context presents further complications. Many hate speech instances are deeply embedded in Switzerland's multilingual, sociocultural, and political landscape (cf. e.g. Stevenson, 1990; Hega, 2001; Br\u00fcgger et al., 2009; Mueller and Dardanelli, 2014; FDFA, 2020), going undetected by existing classifiers.  This challenge was compounded by the lack of annotated Swiss hate speech data for training a reliable baseline classifier at the time of this study.\n\nTo address this gap, we developed a human-in-the-loop hate speech classification framework designed for long-term stability and practical deployment.",

While digitization has improved access to Sanskrit manuscripts [Goyal et al., 2012a; Adiga et al., 2021], their utility remains constrained by complex linguistic phenomena and users' limited language expertise.\n\nThis research focuses on developing neural-based Sanskrit Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems with an accessible web interface. The Sanskrit language presents several challenges for deep learning solutions, including:\n\n- The sandhi phenomenon\n- Rich morphology\n- Frequent compounding\n- Flexible word order\n- Limited resources\n\nThe research identifies four essential tasks for processing Sanskrit texts:\n1. Word segmentation\n2. Dependency parsing\n3. Compound type identification\n4. Analysis of Sanskrit poetry's aesthetic beauty\n\n## Word Segmentation\n\nSanskrit word segmentation (SWS) serves as a crucial first step in processing digitized manuscripts, enabling accessibility and supporting various downstream tasks:\n- Text classification [Sandhan et al., 2019; Krishna et al., 2016b]\n- Morphological tagging [Gupta et al., 2020a; Krishna et al., 2018c]\n- Dependency parsing [Sandhan et al., 2021b; Krishna et al., 2020b]\n- Automatic speech recognition [Kumar et al., 2022]\n\nThe sandhi phenomenon complicates word boundary identification through phonetic transformations, including character deletion, insertion, and substitution at word boundaries.\n\n## Dependency Parsing\n\nFor dependency parsing in low-resource scenarios, several strategies have been developed:\n- Data augmentation\n- Sequential transfer learning\n- Cross-lingual/mono-lingual pretraining\n- Multi-task learning\n- Self-training\n\nWhile these approaches are well-known, selecting the optimal combination for a low-resource language remains challenging. Evaluating their effectiveness is crucial before developing novel solutions for data sparsity.\n\n## Compound Type Identification\n\nThe Sanskrit compound type identification (SaCTI) task often requires contextual understanding or world knowledge about the entities involved [Krishna et al., 2016b]. For example, the compound \"r\u0101ma-\u012b\u015bvarah\" can be classified into multiple semantic types depending on context:\n- Karmadh\u0101raya: \"Lord who is pleasing\"\n- Bahuvr\u012bhi: \"The one whose God is Rama\"\n- Tatpuru\u1e63a: \"Lord of Rama\"\n- Dvandva: \"Lord Rama and Lord Shiva\"\n\nThis complexity affects downstream NLP applications like question answering [Terdalkar and Bhattacharya, 2019] and machine translation [Aralikatte et al., 2021].\n\n## Sanskrit Literature and Computational Analysis\n\nSanskrit literature has profoundly influenced the Indian subcontinent's literary and cultural landscape [Pollock, 2006; Jamison and Brereton, 2014]. Its sophisticated grammatical rules and nuanced vocabulary have enabled poets to craft intricate verses capturing human experience [Pollock, 1996]. While works like the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and the poetry of K\u0101lid\u0101sa and Bhart\u1e5bhari embody Indian thought and culture, computational linguistics research has yet to fully explore Sanskrit poetry's inherent beauty.\n\nThis research ultimately aims to develop accessible Sanskrit NLP technology by addressing these challenges through a user-friendly web interface, making Sanskrit manuscripts more accessible to modern readers and scholars.",
        "The availability of high-quality and diverse 3D assets is critical in many domains, including robotics, gaming, and architecture. Creating these assets has traditionally been a manual and laborious process, demanding expertise in challenging computer graphics tools.\n\nRecent advancements in 3D generative models have revolutionized the creation of 3D assets, allowing for easy generation from simple text prompts or single images. While optimization-based methods can produce high-quality assets, they often require a significant amount of time, sometimes hours, to generate a single 3D asset. In contrast, emerging feed-forward 3D generative methods have shown exceptional quality and diversity while offering substantial speed improvements over optimization-based approaches.\n\nIntroducing the Gaussian Reconstruction Model (GRM) as a new feed-forward 3D generative model has been a significant development in the field. GRM utilizes a sparse-view reconstructor that takes four different views of a 3D object as input and produces the corresponding 3D scene. By replacing the triplane scene representation with 3D Gaussians and employing a transformer architecture, GRM achieves efficient and high-fidelity reconstructions, particularly in capturing fine-grained details.\n\nThe GRM model, with its innovative design and utilization of 3D Gaussian splatting, has demonstrated state-of-the-art quality and speed in sparse-view 3D reconstructions. By combining GRM with multi-view diffusion models, it excels in text-to-3D and single image-to-3D object generation, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in various applications.\n\nIn conclusion, GRM represents a breakthrough in feed-forward 3D generative modeling, offering efficient reconstruction capabilities through the use of 3D Gaussians and a transformer architecture. Its success in achieving high-fidelity reconstructions and superior speed makes it a valuable asset in the realm of 3D asset creation for diverse industries.",
        "In 2005, Sahai and Waters [1] introduced Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) as the first one-to-many cryptosystem. There are two kinds of ABE: ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and key policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE). The first KP-ABE was proposed by Goyal et al. in 2006 [2] and the first CP-ABE by Bethencourt et al. in 2007 [3].\n\nFor Bob to communicate securely with Alice via public key encryption, he encrypts a message with Alice's public key (PK), which Alice decrypts with her secret (private) key (SK). Here, Bob (a data owner or DO) knows that it is Alice (a data user or DU) who he would like to communicate with. However, there are situations where a DO would like to share data securely with (multiple) DUs whose identities are not known. For instance, the President of a university may want to send encrypted data to all the Teacher or Research Assistants in the CIS Department, but does not know the identities of all these eligible students.\n\nIn CP-ABE, a DU receives its SK based on the attributes it possesses. When the DO shares the data securely, the data is encrypted with an access policy. For instance, the University President could share data securely with the policy {\"CIS Department\" & (\"Teacher Assistant\" || \"Research Assistant\")} so that students with either attribute {\"CIS Department\" & \"Teacher Assistant\"} or {\"CIS Department\" & \"Research Assistant\"} can decrypt the President's ciphertext. In KP-ABE, DUs' SKs are generated based on a specific access policy. Clearly, CP-ABE is more applicable to practical applications.\n\nThe original ABE systems employ a central authority (CA) which issues SKs to DUs. Such a centralized architecture suffers from several issues. Efforts [4] - [13] have been proposed to decentralize ABE to address issues such as key escrow [14], ineligible DUs [15], key exposure [16], forging signatures [17], privacy of DUs [18], and flexibility [19]. The main idea of decentralization lies in dividing the responsibilities of the single CA among multiple authorities.\n\nIn both ABE and decentralized ABE (DABE), the CA/authorities are assumed to work honestly so that all the DOs and DUs are obligated to trust CA/authorities. However, since there is no supervision of CA/authorities, there are situations where DUs would not trust CA or authorities. Therefore, the existing DABE models are not capable of handling these situations.\n\nTo address the problem of unwillingness to trust CA/authorities, this paper proposes a new DABE scheme termed data user-based ABE (or DU-ABE for short), where the DUs are not obligated to trust CA/authorities. Instead, the DUs themselves take over the responsibilities of CA/authorities.",
        "This paper explores the challenge of recovering a structured signal from a limited number of corrupted measurements, expressed by the equation:\n\n\\[ y = \\Phi x + v + z \\]\n\nHere, \u03a6 \u2208 R^m\u00d7n is the sensing matrix, x \u2208 R^n represents the structured signal to be estimated, v \u2208 R^m denotes the structured corruption, and z \u2208 R^m stands for unstructured observation noise. The goal is to estimate both x and v based on the given information of y and \u03a6. If v contains useful information, then this model can be viewed as a signal separation (or demixing) problem. Specifically, in the absence of corruption (v = 0), this model reduces to the standard compressed sensing problem. This problem is prevalent in various practical applications, such as face recognition, subspace clustering, sensor networks, latent variable modeling, principal component analysis, and source separation.\n\nTheoretical studies in the literature have explored this problem under different scenarios, including sparse signal recovery from sparse corruption, low-rank matrix recovery from sparse corruption, and structured signal recovery from structured corruption.\n\nGiven the ill-posed nature of this problem, feasible recovery is achievable when both the signal and corruption exhibit suitable structures. Common examples of structured signals or corruptions include sparse vectors and low-rank matrices. Utilizing proper convex functions f(\u2022) and g(\u2022) to encourage structured signal and corruption, respectively, three prevalent convex optimization methods are employed for reconstruction based on available prior information.\n\nWhen prior knowledge of either the signal f(x) or corruption g(v) along with the noise level \u03b4 (in terms of the L2 norm) is known, the following constrained convex recovery procedures are considered:\n\n\\[ \\min_{x,v} f(x) + g(v) \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad ||y - \\Phi x - v||_2 \\leq \\delta \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\min_{x,v} f(x) + g(v) + \\lambda ||y - \\Phi x - v||_2 \\]\n\nIn the case where only the noise level \u03b4 is given, the partially penalized convex recovery procedure is favored, represented as:\n\n\\[ \\min_{x,v} ||y - \\Phi x - v||_2 + \\lambda(f(x) + g(v)) \\]\n\nwhere \u03bb > 0 is a tradeoff parameter. When no prior knowledge is available, the fully penalized convex recovery procedure is applied:\n\n\\[ \\min_{x,v} ||y - \\Phi x - v||_2 + \\lambda_1 f(x) + \\lambda_2 g(v) \\]\n\nwith \u03c4_1, \u03c4_2 > 0 as tradeoff parameters. Numerous numerical findings suggest the emergence of phase transitions in all three recovery procedures under random measurements.\n\nAn essential question that arises is how to accurately determine the phase transition locations.",
        "The standard dialog system development cycle typically involves dialog design, pre-deployment testing, deployment, performance monitoring, model improvement, and iteration. Effective and comprehensive testing at all stages is crucial, as with any production software system. However, evaluating and troubleshooting production TOD systems remains mainly a manual process that demands a significant amount of human interaction. This manual process is time-consuming, costly, and often fails to encompass the vast array of language variations found in the real world (Tan et al., 2021). The labor-intensive nature of this process is compounded when developers make significant changes to dialog flows, necessitating the creation of new test dialog sets (Benvie et al., 2020). Conducting a thorough end-to-end bot evaluation is particularly challenging due to the need for additional annotation efforts. Moreover, the lack of analytical tools for interpreting test results and troubleshooting underlying bot issues poses a significant challenge.\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce BotSIM, a Bot Simulation environment designed for data-efficient end-to-end commercial bot evaluation, remediation through multi-intent dialog generation, and agenda-based dialog user simulation (Schatzmann et al., 2007). BotSIM comprises three key modules: Generator, Simulator, and Remediator (see Figure 1). In the Generator, we employ a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence T5 model (Zhang et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020) to simulate lexical and syntactic variations in user queries by paraphrasing. The Generator also produces various templates required by the Simulator. To ensure BotSIM's versatility across platforms and tasks, we utilize dialog-act level ABUS to simulate interactions with bots through APIs. The Generator automatically deduces dialog acts, providing a unified interface to convert various platform-specific bot designs into a universal graph representation. This graph maps all dialogs as nodes and their transitions as edges, allowing BotSIM to systematically generate and explore multi-intent conversations. The capability to generate conversation paths significantly enhances evaluation coverage, aiding in diagnosing dialog errors stemming from flawed designs (e.g., unexpected dialog loops) and facilitating bot design enhancements. The Remediator presents a dashboard summarizing the bots' status for easy understanding, scrutinizes simulated interactions to pinpoint issues, and offers actionable recommendations for resolution.\n\nThe \"generation-simulation-remediation\" framework of BotSIM can considerably expedite bot development and evaluation, lessening human involvement, costs, and time-to-market. Our key contributions include:\n\u2022 Introducing BotSIM, a modular, data-efficient bot simulation environment, which, to our knowledge, is the first work centered on end-to-end evaluation, diagnosis, and remediation of commercial bots using ABUS.\n\u2022 Providing a methodical approach through BotSIM to generate and simulate multi-intent dialogs, ensuring comprehensive evaluation coverage and enhanced bot design.",
        "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a type of dementia that is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting cognitive function, including language processing. One of the most significant language-related changes in individuals with AD is a decline in their lexicon, referring to the vocabulary and words they use to communicate. The loss of lexicon can make it challenging for individuals with dementia to express themselves clearly and understand others. Early detection of dementia is crucial for timely and appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using machine learning with different linguistic features to detect AD at an early stage, offering advantages such as being less intrusive, having minimal side effects, and being cost-effective.\n\nOne promising approach is using lexical features, linguistic elements related to vocabulary and word usage, in screening for AD through automated analysis of transcribed speech. While previous studies have shown promise in using lexical features to detect AD, there are gaps in understanding the impact of AD on lexicon processing. Existing studies often rely on a small number of lexical features, leading to limitations in generalizability and comparability of findings across studies.\n\nTo address these limitations, this study covers 99 lexical features, including some used in previous dementia studies like the Brunet index and Type Token Ratio (TTR), along with new features such as sentiment analysis, Text Focus, and knowledge depth. This paper aims to study the impact of dementia on a wide range of lexical complexity measures and demonstrate how these features, when combined, can aid in dementia detection using written and transcribed spoken linguistic production. By evaluating factors like the optimal set of features, input size, and model generalization, the study seeks to identify effective combinations for AD classification.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a survey of relevant works on the impact of dementia on lexicon and using machine learning for dementia detection. Section 3 presents the methodology and dataset. Section 4 details the lexical features adopted in the study and their Anova stats. Section 5 covers machine learning experiments and results. Finally, the conclusion and future work will be discussed in Section 6.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow, moving from problem statement to solution and results:\n\nNeural classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, producing unexpected predictions when subject to purposefully constructed human-imperceptible input perturbations and hence manifesting severe safety risks (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018). While existing methods for robust deep neural networks (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) aim to address this issue, they often suffer from significant accuracy penalties on clean (unattacked) data (Tsipras et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Pang et al., 2022). As deep models continue to form the core of numerous products, trading clean accuracy for robustness is understandably unattractive for real-life users and profit-driven service providers. Consequently, despite continuous development in adversarial robustness research, robust models are rarely deployed and practical services remain non-robust (Ilyas et al., 2018; Borkar & Chen, 2021).\n\nTo bridge the gap between robustness research and applications, researchers have explored various approaches to reconcile robustness and accuracy (Balaji et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Raghunathan et al., 2020; Rade & Moosavi-Dezfooli, 2021; Liu & Zhao, 2022; Pang et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2022). Most works focused on improving robust training methods, which are expensive to implement and may be incompatible with each other. Moreover, these methods can be challenging to integrate into recent advancements in large-scale models pre-trained with large real or synthetic datasets. An alternative direction involves creating an ensemble of a standard (often non-robust) model and a robust model (Bai et al., 2023a; 2024), referred to as the mixed classifier.\n\nThrough observation of numerous existing models trained via different methods, we discovered that many robust base models share a benign confidence property: their correct predictions are much more confident than incorrect ones (Peng et al., 2023; Pang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Debenedetti et al., 2022; Na, 2020; Gowal et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023). This observation suggests that strengthening this property could improve mixed classifiers' trade-off without altering the base classifiers' predicted classes.\n\nBased on this intuition, we propose MixedNUTS (Mixed neUral classifiers with Nonlinear TranSformation), a training-free method that optimizes the mixed classifier's accuracy-robustness trade-off by enlarging the robust base classifier confidence difference between correct and incorrect predictions. MixedNUTS applies nonlinear transformations to the accurate and robust base classifiers' logits before converting them into probabilities used for mixing. The transformation is parameterized with only three coefficients and includes an efficient optimization algorithm. Unlike previous approaches, MixedNUTS neither modifies base neural network weights nor introduces additional components, making it efficiently extendable to larger datasets such as ImageNet. Furthermore, it remains compatible with various pre-trained standard and robust models while being agnostic to base model details such as training method, defense norm, training data, and model architecture.\n\nOur experimental results, validated using AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020) and strengthened adaptive attacks, demonstrate balanced accuracy and robustness across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. On CIFAR-100, MixedNUTS achieves a remarkable 7.86 percentage point improvement in clean accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art non-mixing robust model, while reducing robust accuracy by only 0.87 points. Notably, MixedNUTS is the first robust model to leverage larger pre-training datasets such as ImageNet-21k for ImageNet classification. Additionally, it offers the flexibility of inference-time adjustments between clean and adversarial accuracy.",
        "Here's the polished text:\n\n# Motivation\n\nZoos and sanctuaries place significant emphasis on animal welfare [4], which raises critical research questions: How does captivity affect animals' ability to function beneficially [2, 14], and what impact does it have on their potential reintroduction to the wild [8]? These questions are particularly pertinent for Great Apes, especially given that many gorilla species are critically endangered [22]. While prolonged monitoring is essential to answer these questions, the current approach of manual observation by specialists [7] is resource-intensive.\n\n# Contribution\n\nThis paper presents a novel annotated dataset for Great Ape facial identification and explores the capabilities of YOLOv3 [17] in simultaneously detecting and identifying individual zoo gorillas through facial characteristics (Fig. 1). Our work offers three main contributions:\n\n1. Development of a comprehensive dataset comprising 5,428 samples from 7 western lowland gorillas (Fig. 2)\n2. Training and performance evaluation of the YOLOv3 framework for single-frame gorilla face localization and classification\n3.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nSpeech separation technology aims to isolate individual speakers from mixed audio signals, with applications ranging from speaker diarization to multi-talker speech recognition. While deep learning has achieved unprecedented accuracy compared to traditional signal processing methods, several challenges remain. One significant challenge in blind source separation is the speaker label permutation problem, where the order of output speakers is arbitrary and unknown beforehand. Although solutions like clustering-based methods [1] and Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) [2] have emerged, limitations persist. PIT, while aligning frames from the same speaker to the same output stream, still allows frames within an utterance to switch between different sources, compromising separation quality. Alternative approaches include refining the initial PIT-based model through fixed label training [3] or incorporating speaker identity loss to establish long-term dependencies [4, 5]. However, the challenge of identifying speaker order during inference remains, typically requiring a separate speaker recognition system.\n\nTarget speaker extraction [6-8] offers an alternative solution to the label permutation problem by incorporating target speaker identity information into the separation process. A typical speech extraction system comprises two networks: one generating speaker embeddings and another performing the actual extraction. The speaker embedding network can either be trained jointly with the extraction model or separately on speaker recognition tasks to accommodate greater speaker variation [9]. While current methods typically integrate speaker embeddings into the extraction network's middle-stage features through multiplication [7] or concatenation [8, 10], these shared middle-features may not optimize both speaker conditioning and speech reconstruction tasks.\n\nCurrent speech extraction models typically focus on one target speaker at a time, neglecting other speakers' speech. This approach becomes inefficient when multiple speakers are of interest, requiring repeated model application and increased computational resources. While recent innovations like the speaker-conditional chain model (SCCM) [11] attempt to address this by inferring speaker identities before extraction, they still rely on PIT criteria and produce arbitrarily ordered outputs. Additionally, while spatial information from multiple microphones has proven beneficial for both separation and extraction [7, 12] in clean and reverberant environments, its effectiveness in noisy, reverberant conditions with multi-speaker extraction systems remains unexplored.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\nPoint-cloud models offer unique opportunities for efficient software rasterization, as traditional hardware rendering pipelines are primarily designed for triangle rasterization rather than points. In this paper, we consider point clouds as 3D models composed of colored vertices, where each vertex projects to exactly one pixel. While this represents a strict limitation, it allows us to develop algorithms that compete with graphics APIs supporting one-pixel points, such as DirectX (POINTLIST primitive) and its various backends (WebGL, WebGPU, ANGLE, MS Windows games and applications).\n\nPoint clouds possess several distinctive characteristics that simplify their processing. They lack connectivity, eliminating the need for index buffers or vertex duplication. The absence of a connected surface makes UV maps and textures irrelevant, with colors typically stored directly on a per-vertex basis. Additionally, point clouds acquired by laser scanners often don't include surface normals. While normals could be computed in pre-processing, such calculations prove unreliable in sparsely sampled regions with high-frequency details like vegetation, cables, or noise. Therefore, this paper does not consider normals.\n\nThe evolution of hardware with dedicated triangle rasterization units largely rendered hand-crafted software rasterization obsolete. However, custom-built rasterizers have remained an active research topic for developing and studying new approaches. While some methods occasionally outperformed hardware rasterization in specific scenarios [LHLW10], dedicated hardware generally remains the fastest approach. Nanite represents the first framework promising practical improvements for 3D games through hybrid software and hardware rasterization [KSW21]. Their research revealed that directly rasterizing small triangle fragments using atomic min-max operations can be more efficient than processing them through the hardware rendering pipeline, leading to a hybrid approach where only larger triangles utilize hardware rasterization.\n\nOur approach builds upon [SKW21] to further optimize several aspects of point cloud software rasterization, achieving up to 3x higher brute-force performance. Our key contributions include:\n\u2022 Assigning larger workloads to batches to enable efficient batch-level optimizations\n\u2022 Adaptive coordinate precision coupled with visibility-buffer rendering for three times higher brute-force performance\n\u2022 Fine-grained frustum culling on batches of about 10'240 points, directly on the GPU\n\u2022 Support for state-of-the-art level-of-detail structures for point clouds",

These systems, which combine robotic manipulators with multi-rotor UAVs, enable active environmental interaction through tasks such as grasping and transportation\u2014capabilities that transcend the passive monitoring and surveillance functions of traditional aerial systems.\n\n## Technical Challenges\n\nA fundamental challenge in aerial manipulation lies in the complex coupling between the aerial vehicle and the robotic manipulator. The manipulator's movements generate disturbances that affect the UAV's stability. This challenge is compounded by the under-actuated nature of multi-rotor UAVs, making precise disturbance correction and accurate tracking particularly difficult.\n\n## Control Approaches\n\nFrom a control perspective, aerial manipulation systems can be conceptualized as dual controlled objects, with separate controllers for aerial vehicles and manipulators. The dynamic effects of manipulator motion on the multi-rotor UAV\u2014challenging to model precisely\u2014are typically treated as external forces and torques.\n\nRecent research has produced several notable control strategies:\n\n- Variable Parameter Integral Back-stepping (VPIB)\n- Impedance and passivity-based control methods\n- Disturbance observer (DoB) combined with robust control\n- H\u221e controller with disturbance estimation\n\n## Terminal Sliding Mode Control (TSMC)\n\nTSMC has gained prominence for its robust handling of system uncertainties and external disturbances. While not yet implemented in aerial manipulators, various sliding mode control methods have enhanced multi-rotor UAV performance. However, the chattering phenomenon remains a significant challenge, particularly in UAV control applications.\n\n### Control Strategies for Chattering Attenuation\n\nTwo primary approaches have emerged to minimize numerical chattering:\n\n1. Continuous Methods:\n   - Adaptive gain schemes\n   - Singularity-free methods\n\n2. Discrete-time Implementation:\n   - Implicit Euler discretizations\n   - Higher-order super-twisting algorithms\n\n## Research Objectives\n\nThis study introduces a novel approach to address model uncertainties and disturbances in aerial manipulators through super-twisting concepts in multi-rotor control. The research is structured as follows:\n\n- Section II: Quadrotor system modeling (kinetic and dynamic)\n- Section III: Proxy-based Super-Twisting Algorithm (PSTA) implementation\n- Section IV: Numerical simulation results\n- Section V: Gazebo simulation outcomes\n- Section VI: Conclusions and future research directions",

The technology's core challenge lies in decision-making within dynamic and unpredictable environments [1]. These decisions are guided by either optimization-based rules (such as lane-keeping control) or data-driven machine intelligence (like reinforcement learning) [2]. While traditional rule-based approaches face criticism for their limited adaptability in complex traffic scenarios [3, 2], data-driven methods\u2014particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning\u2014have demonstrated superior performance in intricate situations [4, 2].\n\n## Challenges and the Role of Large Language Models\n\nDespite significant progress in autonomous driving methods, reinforcement learning (RL) faces several challenges:\n- Lack of formal guarantees for agent behavior\n- Difficulty ensuring consistent decision-making in complex scenarios\n- Performance degradation in unfamiliar situations\n\nThese limitations have led to exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) as complementary decision-making tools, leveraging their sophisticated reasoning capabilities.\n\n## Understanding Large Language Models\n\nLLMs utilize an optimized transformer architecture in an auto-regressive manner [5]. Their development involves:\n1. Initial training on vast datasets (trillions of tokens)\n2. Integration of billions of parameters\n3. Supervised fine-tuning\n4. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated LLMs' proficiency in complex tasks, including arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning, achieved through Chain-of-thought prompting [6].\n\n## Methodology and Implementation\n\nThis research evaluates hybrid reasoning in autonomous vehicle decision-making using LLM within CARLA [7], focusing on arithmetic within commonsense reasoning under various weather conditions. The decision-making workflow comprises:\n\n1. Object detection using YOLOv8\n2. Data collection (object location, vehicle speed, object distance, vehicle direction)\n3. LLM processing for mathematical calculations\n4. Generation of precise control values for brake and speed\n\nWe developed nine distinct scenarios, ranging from basic common sense to complex hybrid reasoning, using GPT-4. Evaluation against ground truth demonstrated LLMs' capability to process multiple data streams simultaneously and make informed decisions in complex autonomous system scenarios.\n\n[*Note: Figure 1, showing the workflow of hybrid reasoning of LLM in CARLA, would be inserted here in the original document.*]",
        "The text can be restructured for better coherence and flow by organizing it into sections that logically build upon one another, ensuring a smooth transition from discussing general issues in computational linguistics to the specifics of the work. Here is a revised version:\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**\n\nMany techniques in modern computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) assume that approaches that work well on English and other widely used European (and sometimes Asian) languages are \"language agnostic\"\u2014meaning they will also work across the typologically diverse languages of the world. In high-resource languages, especially those that are analytic rather than synthetic, a common approach is to treat morphologically distinct variants of a common root (such as dog and dogs) as completely independent word types. This relies on two main assumptions: that there are a limited number of morphological inflections for any given root and that most or all of those variants will appear in a large enough corpus, allowing the model to learn statistics about each variant adequately.\n\nApproaches like stemming, lemmatization, morphological analysis, subword segmentation, or other normalization techniques are frequently used when either of these assumptions are likely to be violated, particularly in synthetic languages like Czech and Russian, which have more inflectional morphology than English.\n\n**Challenges in Morphologically Complex Languages**\n\nWithin the NLP literature, agglutinative languages like Finnish and Turkish are commonly highlighted as examples of morphological complexity that challenge common modeling assumptions. However, considering all of the world's languages, Finnish and Turkish are closer to the average case regarding synthesis. Polysynthetic languages, which represent the extreme of morphological complexity, present unique challenges. Approaches like stemming, lemmatization, or subword modeling may not suffice for these languages, which often have very high numbers of hapax legomena (words appearing only once in a corpus). This underscores the necessity for appropriate morphological handling of words to capture enough statistical information. Moreover, many of these languages have very small text corpora, which substantially magnifies these challenges.\n\n**Structure of the Work**\n\nIn Chapter 2, we briefly review relevant background literature in finite-state morphology, language modeling, and machine translation. We review finite-state approaches to morphological analysis and major approaches to language modeling, including n-gram language models, feed-forward language models, and recurrent neural language models.\n\nChapter 3 presents a set of polysynthetic languages we will consider throughout this work and details the resources available for each. Our focus is on Inuit-Yupik, a highly challenging family of endangered polysynthetic languages ranging geographically from Greenland through northern Canada and Alaska to far eastern Russia. These languages are extraordinarily challenging from a computational perspective due to the pervasive use of derivational morphemes in addition to rich sets of inflectional suffixes and phonological challenges at morpheme boundaries.\n\nIn Chapters 4-6, we examine the current state-of-the-art in language modeling, machine translation, and predictive text completion in the context of four polysynthetic languages: Guaran\u00ed, St. Lawrence Island Yupik, Central Alaskan Yup'ik, and Inuktitut. Chapter 4 presents experiments and results on machine translation into, out of, and between polysynthetic languages. We conduct experiments between various Inuit-Yupik languages and English, as well as between Guaran\u00ed and Spanish, demonstrating that multilingual approaches incorporating data from higher-resource members of the language family can effectively improve translation into lower-resource languages.\n\nIn Chapter 5, we present language modeling experiments across a range of languages and vocabularies. Chapter 6 discusses practical applications that may benefit from our language model and multilingual approaches, along with preliminary experimental results and a discussion of future work.\n\n**Core Contributions and Future Directions**\n\nFinally, in Chapter 7, we present a core theoretical contribution: a feature-rich open-vocabulary interpretable language model designed to support a wide range of typologically and morphologically diverse languages.",
        "Regular languages can be represented in a multitude of equivalent forms, including finite automata, finite monoids, regular expressions, and formulas of monadic second-order logic.  Often, the most concise representation uses a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA).  Consequently, the study of state-minimal NFAs is of significant computational and mathematical interest.\n\nHowever, minimizing an NFA, or even deciding if one is minimal, is a surprisingly complex PSPACE-complete problem [ ]. This complexity stems from the lack of structure in minimal NFAs: a language may have many non-isomorphic minimal NFA acceptors without easily identifiable properties distinguishing them from non-minimal ones.  This necessitates exhaustive search in all known minimization algorithms (and related procedures like inclusion or universality testing) [ , , ].  This contrasts sharply with deterministic finite automata (DFAs), where a universal property ensures uniqueness up to isomorphism, leading to efficient minimization.\n\nThis paper aims to introduce more structure to the theory of nondeterministic state minimality. We propose a novel algebraic perspective on NFAs based on boolean representations of monoids, specifically morphisms M \u2192 JSL(S, S) from a monoid M into the endomorphism monoid of a finite join-semilattice S. We focus on quotient monoids of the free monoid \u03a3* recognizing a given regular language L \u2286 \u03a3*.  The largest such monoid is \u03a3* itself, and the smallest is the syntactic monoid syn(L).  For both, L induces a canonical boolean representation on the semilattice SLD(L) of all finite unions of left derivatives of L: \u03a3* \u2192 JSL(SLD(L), SLD(L)) and syn(L) \u2192 JSL(SLD(L), SLD(L)).\n\nThe first representation yields an algebraic characterization of minimal NFAs:\n\n**Theorem:** The size of a state-minimal NFA for L equals the least degree of any extension of the canonical representation of \u03a3* induced by L.\n\nHere, the degree of a representation is the number of join-irreducibles of the underlying semilattice.  This result naturally leads to the question of an analogous automata-theoretic perspective on the canonical representation of syn(L) and its extensions.  To this end, we introduce *subatomic* NFAs, generalizing the atomic NFAs of Brzozowski and Tamm [ ].\n\nTo analyze subatomic NFAs, we employ an algebraic framework interpreting NFAs in terms of JSL-DFAs, deterministic finite automata in the category of semilattices.  In this setting, SLD(L) naturally arises as the minimal JSL-DFA for L.  We will show that much of the structure theory of (sub-)atomic NFAs reduces to the self-duality of the category of JSL-DFAs. Our main result characterizes minimal subatomic NFAs:\n\n**Theorem:** The size of a state-minimal subatomic NFA for L equals the least degree of any extension of the canonical representation of syn(L).\n\nWe call this measure the *nondeterministic syntactic complexity* of L.  As illustrated in Section [section number missing], this measure is remarkably natural: existing work on the structure of state-minimal NFAs implicitly identifies language classes where nondeterministic state complexity equals nondeterministic syntactic complexity, effectively focusing on minimal subatomic acceptors.",
        "Smart TVs pose both privacy and security risks. Features like Internet-based media playing and third-party app execution make modern TVs more vulnerable to security attacks and privacy intrusions, despite making them smarter. Several vulnerabilities have been exploited against smart TVs in recent years. In general, security threats against smart TVs fall into two categories: threats from the Internet and threats from programs running on smart TV operating systems (e.g., Android TV OS). To combat these risks, smart TV manufacturers and TV OS providers have implemented various protection measures.\n\nWhile security researchers and TV manufacturers are working to enhance the security of smart TVs, a new attack surface often goes unnoticed\u2014multi-channel remote control communication. A typical application scenario (depicted in Figure 1) involves a smart TV supporting three types of remote controls using different signals: Consumer Infrared (IR), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Wi-Fi. Additionally, smartphones can serve as remote controls by installing a companion app provided by the TV manufacturer. This companion app enables users to interact with the TV through BLE and Wi-Fi signals, offering more functionality than traditional remote controls by fully utilizing the host smartphone's resources.\n\nAlthough multi-channel remote control communication enhances user experience and flexibility, it also introduces security vulnerabilities. Smart TVs typically do not adequately authenticate the identities of their remote controls or verify the data they send. Without necessary protection measures in place, attackers can easily impersonate a remote control or manipulate wireless traffic. Moreover, smart TV operating systems often add remote control interfaces to support advanced features, creating opportunities for attackers to exploit access control vulnerabilities and compromise the TV.\n\nPresenting the EVILSCREEN Attack, this paper introduces a new type of attack that targets multi-channel communication between a smart TV and its remote controls. Unlike existing attacks that require installing malicious apps or exploiting the TV OS, EVILSCREEN leverages the communications of remote controls to hijack the victim TV, making detection and prevention more challenging. The root cause of this attack is a vulnerability known as the EVILSCREEN vulnerability, which allows attackers to combine multiple wireless communications to circumvent authentication and isolation policies, leading to TV hijacking.\n\nTo exploit an EVILSCREEN vulnerability, attackers follow three steps: utilizing less secure wireless channels to provision Wi-Fi credentials, leveraging a weakness in remote control pairing to bind a fake remote control to the TV, and using the fake remote control to access TV resources and control the screen. Unlike attacks that rely on specialized signals, the EVILSCREEN attack utilizes common wireless technologies, making it more widespread. An empirical study conducted on popular smart TVs revealed their vulnerability to the EVILSCREEN attack. Unlike attacks aiming to break wireless protocols, EVILSCREEN exploits simplified or nonexistent security controls during communication between remote controls and smart TVs.\n\nThe contributions of this paper include a systematic analysis of how remote controls impact the security of smart TVs, the implementation of the EVILSCREEN attack affecting millions of smart TVs globally, and the proposal of countermeasures for smart TV manufacturers and developers to mitigate the EVILSCREEN attack.",
        "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a compelling solution for autonomous inspection of structures like wind turbines, eliminating the risks associated with manual climbing or the high costs of disassembling components for inspection.  This work focuses on developing a method for autonomous visual inspection of wind turbine rotor blades *while the turbine is rotating*, offering significant advantages over traditional methods that require halting operation.\n\nTraditionally, wind turbine inspection involved either personnel physically climbing the turbine, a dangerous task, or dismantling the rotor blades, a costly procedure.  Stopping turbine operation for inspection, as required by existing UAV-based inspection methods focusing on stationary turbines, also introduces inconvenience and expense. Inspecting a rotating turbine circumvents these issues.\n\nSeveral studies have explored UAVs, primarily quadrotors, for inspecting *stationary* wind turbines [1]-[4].  For instance, [1] presents a vision-based system using LiDAR and a camera, integrating YOLOv3 and a customized Hough transform.  [2] introduces a machine vision module for UAV navigation during inspection, estimating relative position and blade position using Hough transform and Kalman filter.  [3] focuses on generating a 3D wind turbine map, path planning, and collision avoidance using GPS and 2D LiDAR.  Building upon previous work [4], a semi-autonomous system with a LiDAR-equipped UAV was developed for blade inspection, generating blade images and a 3D turbine model.  Finally, [5] provides a review of non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques for wind turbines, focusing on the inspection methods themselves rather than their implementation.\n\nResearch on inspecting *rotating* wind turbines using UAVs is significantly more limited due to the dynamic environment and the constant need to maintain a safe distance from the moving blades.  However, some promising results have emerged.  [6] proposes a novel method for strain monitoring using optical digital image correlation, validated with strain gauges.  Similarly, [7] employs a drone-mounted digital image correlation system for precise dynamic blade characterization during rotation.\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain, including developing robust blade detection and tracking algorithms, ensuring safe UAV operation in the dynamic environment, and effectively managing dynamically acquired blade information.\n\nThis article presents our work on inspecting rotating wind turbines with a UAV. Our system determines the relative position of the rotating turbine using LiDAR, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS.  We also developed a method for visual inspection of the rotating blades by planning a suitable trajectory and triggering a gimbal-mounted camera.  The system was experimentally tested using data collected at a real-world wind farm.\n\nThe article is structured as follows: Section I introduces the topic and provides a literature review. Section II details the 3D model generation and model matching algorithm for processing LiDAR data. Section III describes the trajectory generation algorithm for inspecting rotating blades and the autonomous camera triggering setup. Section IV presents experimental results from a real-world wind farm and discusses the findings. Finally, Section V concludes the study, summarizing the work and suggesting future research directions.",
        "Over the past decades, modern machine learning techniques have achieved unprecedented success in numerous areas. However, a fundamental limitation of most existing techniques is their inability to generalize well when trained on one dataset but tested on another that is sampled from a different distribution. To address this, domain generalization (DG) seeks to minimize the prediction gap between observed source domains and an unseen target domain by leveraging knowledge extracted from multiple source domains (Blanchard, Lee, and Scott 2011; Muandet, Balduzzi, and Sch\u00f6lkopf 2013; Arjovsky et al. 2019; Li et al. 2018a).\n\nExisting DG methods can be roughly categorized into three groups: data augmentation/generation, disentangled/domain-invariant feature learning, and meta-learning (Wang et al. 2021). In many real-world applications, temporal dynamics across domains are common and can be leveraged to improve accuracy for the unseen target domain (Kumar, Ma, and Liang 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Wang, He, and Katabi 2020). However, a critical issue with these methods is their tendency to treat all domains equally, ignoring the relationships between them, and assuming they are all sampled from a stationary environment.\n\nFor example, it is common for source domains to consist of images collected over several years, while the target domain is an unseen future. In geological applications, source samples might be collected from different altitudes, longitudes, and latitudes, whereas the goal is to generalize to regions where data is inaccessible. Similarly, medical data is often collected with age or other indicators as intervals, and the model needs to perform well on age groups where samples may be rare. Fig. 1(a) illustrates this with instances from the rotated MNIST (RMNIST) dataset, a widely used benchmark in DG literature. Here, digit images are rotated by 15 degrees in each subsequent domain, and Fig. 1(b) shows the drop in generalization performance of state-of-the-art DG algorithms when applied to outer domains (e.g., 0 and 75 degrees). This indicates that the algorithms struggle with \"extrapolation\" due to ignoring the evolving pattern between domains.\n\nIn this paper, we propose addressing this scenario as temporal domain generalization (TDG) (Zeng et al. 2023; Bai, Ling, and Zhao 2022; Nasery et al. 2021; Qin, Wang, and Li 2022). TDG aims to capture and exploit temporal dynamics in the environment by generalizing to a target domain along a specific direction, extracting, and leveraging relationships between source domains. Specifically, we develop a novel theoretical analysis emphasizing the importance of modeling relationships between consecutive domains to capture the environment's evolving pattern. Inspired by Koopman theory (Koopman 1931), which posits that any complex dynamics can be modeled by a linear Koopman operator acting on the space of measurement functions, we propose using the Koopman operator to capture temporal dynamics and align data distributions in Koopman space. As shown in Fig. 1(c), our proposed TKNets outperform other algorithms on the RMNIST dataset, especially as domain distances increase. More details are in Sec.",

Following Rubin (1974), we define a causal effect as the difference between the average outcomes resulting from two different actions\u2014the average treatment effect (ATE). These actions correspond to treatment and control groups, respectively (Imbens & Rubin, 2015).\n\nThe randomized control trial (RCT) is a traditional method for estimating the ATE in scientific experiments. In an RCT, researchers randomly assign one of two actions to each research subject (Kendall, 2003) to obtain an unbiased estimator of the ATE (Imbens & Rubin, 2015). However, RCTs often require large sample sizes for precise ATE estimation.\n\nTo address this limitation, adaptive experimental designs have gained prominence in medicine and social science (Chow SC, 2005; van der Laan, 2008; Komiyama et al., 2009; Hahn et al., 2011; Chow & Chang, 2011; Villar et al., 2015; FDA, 2019). These designs allow researchers to detect true causal effects while exposing fewer subjects to potentially harmful treatments, leading to their recommendation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 2019).\n\n## Research Contribution\n\nThis paper proposes an adaptive experimental design that:\n1. Sequentially estimates treatment assignment probability\n2. Minimizes the asymptotic variance of an ATE estimator\n3. Assigns treatments according to the estimated probability\n\nOur approach builds upon work by van der Laan (2008) and Hahn et al. (2011), who proposed a two-step approach for estimating optimal assignment probability. While their method shows promise for improving conventional RCTs, we enhance efficiency by integrating the two-stage procedure into a sequential process.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n- Establishing a framework for causal inference from time-dependent algorithms\n- Proposing an efficient experimental design algorithm with theoretical guarantees",
        "Data center providers need to maximize server utilization to reap the greatest possible benefits from their substantial capital investments. However, many high-performance computing (HPC) applications achieve only a fraction of their theoretical peak performance, even after careful optimization. This inefficiency can lead to significant resource wastage across the entire data center.\n\nIn HPC systems, resource efficiency is an increasingly critical concern in the pursuit of exascale computing performance. Achieving exascale with current technology would require an impractically high amount of energy. Alarmingly, the electricity costs over the lifespan of these platforms could equal their hardware expenses. While energy-proportional designs could offer a solution, this technology is still in development. Consequently, exascale systems are expected to face resource constraints in the near future, with limited provisioned power severely restricting scalability to meet new user demands.\n\nIn a resource-constrained server environment, it is crucial to minimize resource usage while meeting performance requirements to keep up with rising computational demands. Techniques like hardware over-provisioning can be effective in systems with strict power limits. Over-provisioning involves using less power per node, allowing for more nodes in the system. In practice, over-provisioning can be implemented by enforcing socket-level power limits with Intel's RAPL technology. RAPL manages power usage of server components by updating registers and monitors low-level hardware events to estimate power consumption. It adjusts processor voltage and frequency to meet a specified power cap over a set time interval.\n\nDynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) also adapts processor voltage and frequency to reduce power consumption. Lower frequencies require less power, which can lead to energy savings. However, this may negatively impact processor performance. Alone, neither DVFS nor RAPL is sufficient for operating in an over-provisioned environment, as each only enforces power limits for individual components, such as the CPU. Therefore, a global scheduler is needed to enforce power limits across all components and prevent exceeding the system's power capacity.\n\nA promising method to increase overall system utilization and efficiency is running multiple applications concurrently on a server node, a technique known as workload colocation. The primary drawback of workload colocation is potential performance degradation due to shared resources like caches, memory controllers, data prefetchers, and I/O devices. This degradation is challenging to predict in real systems, making it impractical to measure the degradation of all application pairs in advance.\n\nDue to these unpredictable degradation effects, HPC systems typically do not allow resource sharing among applications on the same computing node. Despite this, workload colocation has considerable potential to enhance system throughput, especially when colocated applications are bottlenecked on different resources. Importantly, this improvement in system utilization can be achieved without modifying the application's source code.\n\nMachine learning techniques can uncover complex relationships among input features, such as hardware performance monitoring counters (PMCs), and predict the slowdown experienced by colocated applications. Given the diverse nature of applications in HPC systems, machine learning models can generalize to new and different applications. Although some machine learning approaches are computationally intensive, our experiments demonstrate that they can be used with acceptable execution overhead through optimizations, such as reducing the number of trees in a random forest model.\n\nThis paper presents an approach integrating a machine learning model into an intelligent application scheduler. Our goal is to reduce the makespan\u2014the time from the start of the first application to the end of the last application in a fixed-size job queue. We contribute the following:\n\n1.",
        "In a well-known scene from the film \"Titanic,\" Rose makes a simple yet profound request of Jack: \"...draw me like one of your French girls.\" This request is deceptively rich in information. It instructs Jack to create a drawing, suggests that the style and composition should align with a particular subset of his past works, and through the word \"me,\" specifies the unique subject: Rose herself. By making this request, Rose trusts Jack's ability to reason over both broad and specific concepts and bring them to life in a new creation.\n\nRecently, large-scale text-to-image models (Rombach et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2021, 2022; Nichol et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022) have demonstrated an unprecedented capacity to interpret natural language descriptions. These models enable users to synthesize novel scenes with unseen compositions and produce vivid images in a myriad of styles. They have been employed for artistic creation, as sources of inspiration, and even in designing new physical products (Yacoubian, 2022). However, their use is constrained by the user's ability to describe the desired outcome through text. Returning to Rose, one might wonder: How would she phrase her request if she were to approach one of these models? How can we, as users, instruct text-to-image models to craft a novel scene featuring a cherished childhood toy or transform a child's drawing from the fridge into a work of art?\n\nIntroducing new concepts into large-scale models is often challenging. Re-training a model with an expanded dataset for each new concept is prohibitively expensive, and fine-tuning with a few examples typically leads to catastrophic forgetting (Ding et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022). More measured approaches freeze the model and train transformation modules to adapt its output for new concepts (Zhou et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021; Skantze & Willemsen, 2022). However, these approaches still risk forgetting prior knowledge or struggle to access it concurrently with newly learned concepts (Kumar et al., 2022; Cohen et al., 2022).\n\nWe propose to overcome these challenges by discovering new words within the textual embedding space of pre-trained text-to-image models. Our focus is on the first stage of the text encoding process (Figure 2). Here, an input string is initially converted into a set of tokens. Each token is then replaced with its own embedding vector, which is processed by the downstream model. Our aim is to identify new embedding vectors that represent new, specific concepts.\n\nWe represent a new embedding vector with a pseudo-word, denoted as S*. This pseudo-word is treated like any other word and can be used to create novel textual queries for the generative models. Users can request \"a photograph of S* on the beach,\" \"an oil painting of S* hanging on the wall,\" or even combine concepts, such as \"a drawing of S1* in the style of S2*.\"",
        "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved unprecedented success in graph-based machine learning, outperforming traditional algorithms across a wide range of applications such as recommendation systems and social media. The demand for low-latency GNN inference is increasing in real-world scenarios, like real-time traffic prediction and GNN-based scientific simulations.\n\nAccelerating GNN inference poses a challenge as it requires both sparse and dense computation kernels. Sparse computation leads to poor data reuse and irregular memory access patterns, while dense computation allows for regular memory access patterns. General-purpose processors like CPUs and GPGPUs are inefficient for GNN inference due to complex cache hierarchies and inefficient microarchitecture designs for various computation kernels in GNNs.\n\nState-of-the-art GNN frameworks like Pytorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) exhibit high inference latency on GPUs due to lengthy GPU kernel launch times and suboptimal execution paradigms for sparse computations, resulting in large memory traffic. This inefficiency has led to the proposal of numerous GNN accelerators aiming to overcome the limitations of CPUs and GPUs.\n\nPrevious works have focused on designing accelerators for specific GNN models or developing design automation frameworks to generate FPGA accelerators tailored to specific GNN models and input graphs. However, these frameworks need to regenerate optimized hardware designs whenever there are changes in the GNN model structure or input graph topology, involving meta-compilation, hardware synthesis, place & route, and FPGA reconfiguration, which are not ideal for cloud-based FPGA accelerators.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce GraphAGILE, an FPGA-based overlay accelerator that unifies the execution of sparse and dense computation kernels of GNNs without the need for hardware reconfiguration. GraphAGILE's instruction set architecture (ISA) and compiler provide software-like programmability for a specific application domain. The compiler takes the GNN model specification and graph metadata as inputs to generate instructions for the ISA, effectively reducing inference latency through various optimizations.\n\nOur main contributions include the proposal of an ISA designed to accelerate GNN inference by efficiently executing various computation kernels such as GEMM, SpDMM, and SDDMM across a wide range of GNN models. GraphAGILE stands as the first FPGA overlay accelerator specifically tailored for GNNs.",
        "In this paper, we present several algorithmic advancements and enhancements of FeTrIL, originally introduced by Petit et al. (2023) [12]. Through extensive experimentation, we offer a deeper exploration of the capabilities of the recently introduced Enhanced Feature Consistency Incremental Learning (EFCIL) method. FeTrIL uniquely merges a frozen feature extractor with a pseudo-feature generator, utilizing geometric translation to maintain a robust representation of both new and previous classes within the feature space. To further validate and refine our approach, we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effects of oversampling and optimization techniques on incremental learning performance.\n\nOur analysis indicates that the effectiveness of oversampling depends on the feature density among classes. Specifically, in situations where the feature count per image is relatively low, oversampling can notably increase accuracy. Conversely, in cases of inherently high feature count, oversampling may yield diminishing returns. This impact is noticeable across various datasets like CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet, each containing 500 images, compared to ImageNet-Subset with 1500 images. These results highlight the nuanced correlation between feature availability and incremental learning efficiency, as detailed in Table II.\n\nFurther experimentation with a dynamic recalibration technique shows significant advantages for extensive and varied datasets. By accurately reflecting the evolving data distribution across learning stages, this method ensures that the pseudo-features closely match the actual feature distributions, a crucial factor in maintaining accuracy amid the introduction of new classes. In contrast, optimization methods applied to the initial pseudo-features generated from geometric translation, which extract features from an expanded pool including multiple new classes, exhibit performance improvements by enhancing the composition of pseudo-features.\n\nA key observation from our study concerns the potential pitfalls of optimization methods that replace features in cases where the feature pool lacks ample diversity, resulting in the repetition of features in the optimized set. Our exploration of various optimization strategies, from selecting single features to diverse feature pooling and dynamic recalibration, sheds light on the delicate balance between feature diversity and optimization effectiveness in enhancing model performance.\n\nThis comprehensive investigation not only validates the robustness of the FeTrIL framework but also elucidates the complex dynamics involved in feature-based incremental learning. By incorporating these nuanced insights, we aim to further refine FeTrIL's architecture and optimization techniques, pushing the boundaries of EFCIL research.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\n# Data-Aware Color Palette Generation for Statistical Graphics\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn statistical graphics such as bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots, categorical data visualization typically relies on unique colors to distinguish between different categories or classes. During visual analysis, the ability to discriminate between classes becomes crucial. While research has established that color choice significantly impacts class discriminability, selecting an optimal color set for specific visualizations remains challenging, even for experienced practitioners.\n\n## Traditional Approaches\n\nThe conventional approach involves a two-step process:\n1. Selecting an appropriate color palette\n2. Assigning colors to classes optimally\n\nSeveral tools facilitate this process, including ColorBrewer and Colorgorical, which offer highly discriminable and aesthetically pleasing palettes. However, since these palettes are created independently of specific visualization data, even well-designed palettes may not achieve optimal class discrimination in different visualization contexts. This often leads to iterative trial-and-error with various palettes and assignment schemes.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nRecent research has attempted to address these limitations:\n\n- Wang et al. proposed an automated method for assigning palette colors to multi-class scatterplot elements, maximizing discriminability. While this eliminates manual color assignment, it remains limited to scatterplots and still requires initial palette selection.\n\n- Chen et al. introduced an automatic color selection approach for multi-class scatterplots, focusing on the a* and b* channels in CIELAB space. However, excluding the L* channel often limits discriminability, particularly with numerous classes.\n\n## Introducing Palettailor\n\nTo address these limitations, we present Palettailor, a data-aware color palette generation framework that automatically creates categorical palettes optimized for different visualization types. The framework incorporates three key color-scoring functions:\n\n1. Point Distinctness\n2. Name Difference\n3. Color Discrimination constraint\n\nBy combining visualization-based and palette-based measurements, Palettailor unifies palette selection and color assignment into a single framework. Users need only specify:\n- Scoring function weights\n- Background color preferences\n\n## Technical Innovation\n\nWe enhance existing class separation measures by replacing the traditional K-Nearest-Neighbor-Graph approach with an \u03b1-shape graph method.",

However, real-world applications\u2014such as autonomous driving (Sadigh et al. 2018; Fisac et al. 2019), assistive robotics (Agrawal and Williams 2017; Li et al. 2019), and Unmanned Aerial Systems (McNeese et al. 2018; Demir, McNeese, and Cooke 2017)\u2014rarely involve homogeneous teams with shared information. Instead, these scenarios typically require interaction with diverse human participants who possess varying intents and beliefs. Understanding these human factors is crucial for effective robot-human interaction.\n\n## Human-Agent Teaming (HAT)\n\nHuman-agent teaming (HAT) (Scholtz 2003; Chen and Barnes 2014) represents an emerging paradigm in human-agent systems. Successful HAT requires coordinated reasoning, actions, and behaviors among team members to achieve collective objectives (Morgan Jr et al. 1986; Salas, Sims, and Burke 2005; Salas, Cooke, and Rosen 2008). Our research focuses on two-player human-agent collaboration in a computer game environment, where agents must cooperate with humans in real-time to accomplish shared goals. Importantly, the human participants may vary in expertise and approach.\n\n## Core Challenges\n\nA fundamental challenge in human-agent collaboration lies in humans' complex and sometimes unpredictable behavioral patterns (Chen and Barnes 2012; Green and Bavelier 2006). Humans may interact with multi-agent systems in unexpected ways based on their perceptions, attitudes, and trust levels (Parasuraman and Riley 1997). This variability becomes particularly significant when agents must interact with a diverse population of human players, each bringing different intentions, beliefs, and skill levels (Kurin et al. 2017).\n\n## Real-Time Adaptation\n\nThe ability to adapt to human behavior is essential for successful human-agent team deployment in real-time environments (Bradshaw, Feltovich, and Johnson 2011). This adaptation capability is particularly crucial in dynamic settings like urban driving for autonomous vehicles (Fisac et al. 2019). Effective real-time adaptation requires agents to:\n\n1. Interpret the semantics of observed human behavior\n2. Handle volatile and noisy data\n3. Infer appropriate responses\n4. Process limited observations of recent human actions\n5. Account for varying play styles and skill levels\n6. Adapt to humans who may themselves adjust their behavior\n\n## Approaches to Adaptive Agent Training\n\nPrevious research on real-time adaptation in HAT falls into two categories:\n\n### 1.",

This discipline's insights extend across multiple fields, including sociology, psychology, economics, and animal behavior. In the digital age, online communities\u2014particularly collaborative platforms like wikis, Q&A websites, and social media\u2014have emerged as rich sources of data for studying social phenomena.\n\nReddit, an online discussion platform, provided a fascinating case study through its 2017 April Fools' Day social experiment called \"Place\" (or r/place). The experiment centered around a 1000\u00d71000-pixel online canvas where registered users could modify individual pixels using a 16-color palette. To regulate participation, users faced a mandatory waiting period of 5-20 minutes between pixel placements.\n\nOver just 72 hours, this simple concept evolved into an extraordinary demonstration of collective action. More than a million Reddit users contributed 16.5 million pixels, transforming the blank canvas into a complex tapestry of competing communities, nations, and ideologies. While individual users\u2014limited by the time restriction\u2014could achieve little alone, collaborative efforts quickly produced sophisticated artworks that exceeded all expectations. The r/place Atlas project later documented nearly 1500 distinct objects and phenomena in the final canvas, though it didn't track the evolution of these elements throughout the experiment.\n\nTechnical details from the complete dataset, released by u/Drunken Economist (2017), reveal that pixel placements actually occurred over a broader timeframe, from 2017-03-21 21:03:09 UTC to 2017-04-03 16:58:55 UTC.",
        "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables round-the-clock, all-weather observation of the Earth by using the synthetic aperture principle to achieve high-resolution microwave imaging. Accurately and swiftly classifying ships in SAR images is crucial for executing certain sea surface missions. However, SAR ship classification using data-driven deep learning faces a more significant challenge of overfitting compared to optical images, primarily due to the limited availability of SAR ship data and the presence of noise.\n\nWith the rapid advancement of deep learning in image processing, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become increasingly popular in the field of SAR ship classification. However, the complexity of CNN models can introduce redundant features, further increasing the risk of overfitting. Knowledge distillation (KD), which transfers knowledge from a cumbersome pre-trained teacher model to a lightweight student model, has been widely utilized in various SAR tasks. These works inherit the concept of knowledge transfer from traditional KD. Recently, it has been suggested that the success of KD can be attributed to the regularization effect of the soft labels provided by the teacher model, from the perspective of label smoothing regularization (LSR). This highlights the significant potential of applying KD in the field of regularization.\n\nTo enhance the generalization of SAR ship classification, this paper introduces the Double Reverse Regularization Network, which incorporates both online and offline distillation. As illustrated in Figure 1, the network controls the reverse adjustment of the offline and online distillation weights, effectively utilizing the knowledge of both the teacher and the student.",

While understanding model output is crucial for human acceptance of machine learning systems (Shin, 2021), the relationship between input and output in LLMs remains largely opaque (Adadi and Berrada, 2018).\n\nThe recent advancement of LLMs in generating extended coherent text has led to the rise of self-rationalizing models, which provide natural language explanations (NLEs) alongside their outputs (Hase et al., 2020; Marasovic et al., 2021). NLEs offer several advantages over non-textual explanations: they are more highly valued by users (Forrest et al., 2018), demonstrate broad applicability across various problems, and can integrate external knowledge with model input. However, while NLEs can indicate the plausibility of LLM predictions, their faithfulness to the actual prediction process remains questionable (Wiegreffe et al., 2021; Atanasova et al., 2023; Turpin et al., 2023).\n\nIn this research, we propose a hypothesis-driven framework to explore patterns in generated NLEs, aiming to develop a surrogate model. Our framework centers on a hypothetical global explanation (HGE)\u2014a hypothesis about how the LLM approaches a specific task at a global, structural level. While we begin with a deliberately simplified hypothesis to establish and validate the framework, we anticipate its gradual evolution toward more sophisticated hypotheses. Each refinement step's patterns can then measure their coverage, or e-recall (Goldberg, 2023), within the LLM.\n\nOur framework's foundation is a statistical surrogate model (SSM) that embodies the HGE. We propose implementing a Bayesian Network (Pearl, 1988) with a manually designed structure as the SSM framework. This network visualizes the relationships between random variables through a directed acyclic graph (DAG), allowing us to define variables and their interactions in alignment with the HGE.",

While digital mammography is effective in detecting breast cancer, it struggles with identifying dense lesions that resemble dense tissues. Additionally, it involves ionizing radiation. As a safer alternative, ultrasound (US) imaging plays a crucial role in screening and diagnosing breast cancer. However, US images often suffer from low resolution and poor contrast due to speckle noise, making segmentation challenging.\n\nTo address these issues, researchers have turned to cutting-edge deep learning techniques to improve manual segmentation. Despite the success of deep learning in computer vision, its effectiveness in medical US images is limited by the size of available data. The labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating US images underscores the need for a deep learning approach that can learn from a minimal amount of annotated data.\n\nThe U-Net architecture, a popular network for segmentation, is a fully convolutional network comprising convolutional, maxpooling, and up-sampling layers. To tackle the challenge of training U-Net with limited data, researchers have proposed strategies involving data augmentation and transfer learning. While data augmentation falls short in capturing real data characteristics, our proposed methodology, based on transfer learning, leverages US simulation data and natural images as auxiliary datasets. The aim is to improve segmentation outcomes, even with a limited image dataset.",
        "Studying the distribution of data is a fundamental task in data mining and data science. When analyzing observations from a large domain, it is often necessary to track the cumulative frequency distribution to understand behavior patterns or identify anomalies. This cumulative distribution function (CDF) is also referred to as order statistics, and it generalizes concepts such as the median and quantiles. With a large number of observations, providing an exact characterization becomes impractical, so we often rely on an approximate representation\u2014a compact function whose distance from the true CDF is bounded. Recent research suggests that instead of focusing on a uniform error bound, it is more crucial to accurately capture the details in the tail of the input distribution.\n\nTo address the challenge of processing large volumes of distribution data, many approximate quantile algorithms have been proposed to generate a concise summary. These algorithms are designed to handle data either as a stream of updates or as distributed observations. Although these various algorithms share similar motivations, their focus can differ significantly.",

A model achieves calibration when its prediction confidence accurately reflects its probability of being correct [1]. However, deep neural networks typically exhibit overconfidence in their predictions [1], prompting various recent approaches to improve their calibration [2, 3]. Additionally, models must demonstrate robustness to data domain shifts that commonly occur between training and deployment environments.\n\n## Deep Ensembles and Diversity\n\nDeep Ensembles [4] continue to outperform most alternative approaches. Their success is often attributed to the high diversity of solutions within the ensemble [5, 6, 7], primarily achieved through training from different parameter initializations. While empirically effective, this approach has limitations\u2014distance in parameter space from different starting positions doesn't guarantee diversity in the solution space (functional diversity) [8], though such diversity is crucial for ensemble performance [6, 8].\n\n## Current Approaches to Generating Diversity\n\nRecent research has explored various methods to generate ensemble diversity [6]:\n- Training with different architectures [9, 10]\n- Applying different data augmentations [11]\n- Varying hyperparameters [12]\n\nThese implicit approaches have drawbacks:\n- No guaranteed diversity\n- Time-consuming design decisions\n- Extensive hyperparameter tuning requirements\n\nWhile functional diversity can be explicitly regularized [7]\u2014an approach recently applied to improve adversarial robustness [13, 14]\u2014these methods have limitations:\n- Reliance on original training data for diversity measures\n- Potential accuracy degradation\n- Poor out-of-distribution detection performance\n- Computationally expensive simultaneous training requirements\n\n## Parameter-Sharing Ensembles\n\nOur research focuses on ensembles with shared parameters between members.

        "Prompt-tuning has emerged as a promising method for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially in few-shot scenarios (Gu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2022).  By freezing the PLM's parameters and training only a small set of prompt parameters with limited data, well-optimized few-shot prompt-tuning achieves performance comparable to full model fine-tuning across various PLM sizes and NLP tasks (Gu et al., 2022; Lester et al., 2021). This success has motivated adversaries to explore prompt-based Trojan (or backdoor) attacks (Xu et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2024).  For example, a user might specify an open-source PLM and submit a training dataset to a service provider to request a prompt for a new downstream task. A malicious provider could then return a backdoored prompt.  Upon using this prompt, the PLM would misclassify inputs containing a specific trigger to a predefined target class, while classifying other inputs normally, as illustrated in Figure 1(a).\n\nUnfortunately, existing prompt-based backdoors (Xu et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023) are not compatible with few-shot prompt-tuning.  They require either full model fine-tuning (Xu et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2022) or extensive training data (Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022).  To achieve a high attack success rate (ASR), methods like BToP (Xu et al., 2022), Notable (Mei et al., 2023), and BadPrompt (Cai et al., 2022) modify a significant number of PLM parameters, making them less stealthy and more vulnerable to backdoor detection techniques (Feng et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023b).  While PPT (Du et al., 2022) and PromptAttack (Shi et al., 2022) only tune prompt parameters, they require hundreds of training samples for a high ASR. DecodingTrust (Wang et al., 2023) evaluates attacks using hand-crafted prompts on GPT models but doesn't address prompt-tuning scenarios.\n\nConstructing a prompt-based backdoor through few-shot prompt-tuning, while freezing the PLM and training a smaller set of soft prompt parameters with limited data (e.g., 16-shot), presents several challenges.",
        "Formal verification is increasingly being adopted to support the development of high-quality, provably correct software. High-stakes domains such as security-sensitive systems, cryptographic libraries, aerospace systems, and embedded software in medical devices rely on formal verification for correctness guarantees.\n\nFor instance, CompCert C [CompCert 2023], a formally verified C compiler that won the ACM Software Systems award in 2021, was found to have no bugs in a comprehensive study by Yang et al. (2011). This contrasts with the GCC [GCC 2023] and LLVM [LLVM 2023] toolchains. The study motivated Airbus to adopt CompCert C to enhance safety and aircraft performance [Fran\u00e7a et al. 2011]. Similarly, the seL4 project [Klein et al. 2009], awarded the ACM Software System Award in 2022, produced a formally verified high-assurance, high-performance operating system microkernel used to protect an autonomous helicopter against cyber-attacks [seL4 Project 2023]. To ensure secure communication, both Chrome and Android use formally verified cryptographic code [Erbsen et al. 2020], and Mozilla has incorporated its verified cryptographic library to improve Firefox's performance [Jacobs and 2020 2023].\n\nFormal code verification consists of two interconnected parts: the formal specification of software properties and the automated or semi-automated verification of those properties. Over the past 50 years, verification has seen significant breakthroughs, starting with the development of interactive theorem provers in the 1960s [Nederpelt et al. 1994] and later with the development of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers around the turn of the millennium [Barrett et al. 2021]. However, writing program properties and proofs remains a creative and manual process that requires considerable effort, experience, and expertise. Formal specification languages are closer to mathematics than to traditional programming languages, incorporating subtle concepts based on classical or constructive logics. For example, writing the proofs for the seL4 microkernel was an eleven person-year effort by a group of experts [Murray et al. 2013]. Similarly, the verification code for the CompCert C compiler is more than three times the size of the original compiler code, taking three person-years to complete, which equates to roughly two lines of code per day [Leroy 2009]. The prestigious awards these systems have received underscore the exceptional nature of these efforts.\n\nIn the realm of languages and systems for formal code verification, Dafny [Microsoft 2023a] distinguishes itself by prioritizing usability for programmers rather than mathematicians. Dafny is a strongly typed imperative programming language with functional and object-oriented features that supports code verification via Hoare Logic [Hoare 1969] assertions, preconditions, postconditions, and invariants (also known as design by contract). While algorithmic code in Dafny is similar to many other programming languages, writing formal specifications and auxiliary verification assertions remains challenging [Faria and Abreu 2023; Noble et al. 2022].\n\nOver the past year, stochastic Large Language Models (LLMs) have been revolutionizing both the software industry and research in software engineering. LLM-assisted tools such as GitHub Copilot [Copilot 2023] and Amazon CodeWhisperer [CodeWhisperer 2023] have accelerated various software development tasks, including code generation, transformation, summarization, documentation, code review, program repair, and synthesis. Although their performance is impressive for straightforward tasks in popular programming languages, when faced with more complex problems or less familiar languages like Dafny, LLMs tend to produce \"hallucinations\" [Azaria and Mitchell 2023; Galitsky 2023; McKenna et al.",
        "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most extensively studied challenges in combinatorial optimization. In its classic form, a salesman aims to visit a set of cities exactly once and return home, all while minimizing travel costs. The costs of traveling between cities are stored in a matrix where each entry, \\( c_{ij} \\), indicates the cost of traveling from city \\( i \\) to city \\( j \\). These costs can be measured in terms of distance, time, money, etc.\n\nIf the underlying graph of the TSP is sparse, a complete cost matrix can still be constructed by setting \\( c_{ij} \\) equal to the shortest path between city \\( i \\) and city \\( j \\) for each pair of cities. However, this approach has the drawback of converting a sparse graph \\( G = (V, E) \\), where the edge set \\( E \\) could be of size \\( O(|V|) \\), into a complete graph \\( G = (V, \\overline{E}) \\), where the edge set \\(\\overline{E}\\) is \\( O(|V|^2) \\).\n\nRatliff and Rosenthal were the first to explore the case where the edge set is not expanded into a complete graph, but instead, remains sparse.",
        "Quantum machine learning seeks to leverage quantum computers to enhance the capabilities of machine learning. One potential avenue for achieving quantum advantage in this field is through the use of quantum embedding kernels. These kernels allow quantum computers to encode data in ways that are challenging for classical machine learning methods to replicate. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers have shown potential in tackling tasks that are difficult for classical computers and have been promising in running proof-of-concept quantum machine learning applications. However, current quantum computers operate at a speed that is at least six orders of magnitude slower than classical computers. Moreover, the operational cost of quantum computers is high, necessitating the development of resource-efficient methods. Therefore, there is a critical need to improve how we run and benchmark these noisy quantum systems.\n\nSeveral practical bottlenecks constrain the use of quantum hardware for machine learning. First, the conventional methods for measuring quantum kernels require quantum resources that scale quadratically with the size of the training dataset, which is restrictive since machine learning typically involves large datasets. Second, data must be efficiently encoded into the quantum computer to generate a useful quantum kernel. While various encoding methods have been proposed, they often face limitations due to the number of qubits or are characterized in a heuristic manner. Lastly, the inherent noise in quantum computers compromises the quality of experimental results. Error mitigation strategies have been suggested, but these generally demand a substantial amount of additional quantum computing resources.\n\nIn this work, we use randomized measurements to calculate quantum kernels.",
        "The randomness inherent in human-driving behavior creates instability within the traffic system, contributing significantly to shockwaves and stop-and-go patterns. These phenomena have become primary safety concerns and the main causes of traffic jams. Moreover, human drivers strive to maximize travel efficiency by improving average speed and minimizing headway. Consequently, a critical question for developing an intelligent car-following system is how to encourage vehicles to travel as fast as possible while maintaining safe and efficient headway to the leading vehicle and reducing shockwaves.\n\nCar-following is a fundamental driving task that has spurred the development of numerous models aimed at mimicking human driving behavior. In traffic flow theory, classic Car-Following Models (CFMs) are rooted in physical knowledge and human behaviors. For instance, the Gipps model considers both free-flow mode (without a leading vehicle) and car-following mode (with a leading vehicle), using the minimum velocity of the two modes to decide on acceleration or deceleration. The following vehicle's speed is also constrained by safety considerations. Another well-known model, the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), determines the output acceleration based on desired velocity, headway, relative velocity, and distance to the leading vehicle.\n\nIn recent years, data-driven methods have been proposed to train CFMs. He et al. utilized K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to deduce the most likely behavior of vehicles in the car-following mode. Other studies have applied supervised learning; for example, Chong et al. used Neural Networks (NN) to model driver behavior in terms of longitudinal and lateral actions, while Zhou et al. employed Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to capture and predict traffic oscillations. Although supervised learning methods have shown promising results, they require hand-collected microscopic car-following data, which are rare and expensive to acquire. The data collected typically originate from human drivers, and learning methodologies such as Imitation Learning might lead trained models to adopt irrational behaviors, such as overly aggressive or conservative patterns.\n\nAutonomous driving technology has been extensively studied and is becoming a reality with the advancement of sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Autonomous vehicles have the potential to outperform human driving in terms of safety and comfort. One significant advantage of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is their ability to substantially reduce randomness in driving behavior, allowing the entire system to be better managed by control algorithms with minimal reaction time.\n\nRecent research has seen the rapid maturation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications. RL has effectively addressed problems in areas such as Go and Atari games. Within this framework, RL agents interact with the environment, observing states and receiving corresponding rewards. They aim to discover optimal policies that maximize accumulated rewards. A well-defined reward function typically ensures that an agent's policy converges to the desired objective. For example, Zhu et al. defined CFMs to maintain safe distances to the front vehicle while achieving desired speeds, and their model demonstrated strong generalization compared to data-driven CFM.\n\nIn our study, we focus on extending the Bidirectional Car-Following Model (BCM) into a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework to address the multi-objective problem of optimizing efficiency, safety, comfort, and traffic stability. Our experimental results reveal that our proposed bidirectional DRL CFM surpasses previous human driving models in terms of inter-vehicle headways, average speed, jerk, safety, and string stability.",
        "Major financial exchanges such as NASDAQ, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and London Stock Exchange (LSE) have recently expressed interest in migrating their workloads to the cloud. This move aims to significantly reduce their capital expenditure, improve scalability, and reduce operational burdens. For cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, this migration represents a substantial business opportunity, as it is a mutually beneficial undertaking for all parties involved. Major market participants of these exchanges would also benefit from this migration since they currently maintain expensive on-premise infrastructure for data analysis and regression modeling to formulate their trading strategies.\n\nTo facilitate this shift, cloud providers and financial exchanges have announced long-term partnerships. Both parties recognize the challenges of migrating varied workloads currently managed on the exchanges' on-premise infrastructure. In this context, our focus in this paper is on \"speed race\" trading, a crucial and highly profitable aspect of electronic trading for both financial exchanges and market traders.\n\n'Speed race' trading is a form of systematic electronic trading where market participants (MPs) use high-performance computers to quickly react to and exploit new market opportunities, such as volatility or price discrepancies. High-Frequency Traders, as they are known, invest heavily in hardware, systems, and algorithmic development to achieve impressively low reaction times, often on the microsecond or nanosecond scale. This business model is viable only if all MPs can compete fairly, as guaranteed by the Central Exchange Server (CES) operators. Fairness means that all participants receive simultaneous access to market data, and trades are executed in the exact order they were generated.\n\nWith on-premise deployments, financial exchanges ensure fairness in speed race trading by guaranteeing equal bi-directional latency to the relevant market participants. Exchanges go to great lengths to maintain this fairness, using technologies like layer-1 fan-out switches and equal-length cables to all co-located MPs. However, public cloud datacenter networks were not originally designed for such fairness guarantees. They cater to a heterogeneous, multi-tenant environment with diverse workloads, making it difficult to ensure equal latency between the CES and various MPs, even within the same cloud region.\n\nThis challenge has recently drawn attention from the academic community. Proposed solutions aim to achieve fairness by providing equal, albeit inflated, bi-directional latencies in the cloud, relying on tight clock synchronization and buffering for market data delivery. However, these approaches are fragile because datacenter network latencies are variable and unbounded. Other proposals necessitate intrusive modifications to existing CES implementations.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach to address fairness in cloud environments for speed race trading. Our key insight is that equal bi-directional latencies are not essential to achieve fairness. Instead of preemptively equalizing latency, we can post facto correct latency differences by ordering trades differently. We introduce logical delivery clocks that track time relative to when market data were received, allowing us to present Delivery Based Ordering (DBO). This system orders trades to guarantee fairness even in network topologies with non-deterministic and unbounded latency.\n\nWe have implemented a real DBO system, evaluated on a bare-metal server testbed utilizing programmable NICs, and further assessed it in a public cloud deployment using standard VMs. Our system achieves guaranteed fairness and sub-100 microsecond 99.9th percentile latency while servicing 125,000 trades per second.",
        "Two problems that have received significant attention in Parameterized Approximation [12] are the classical MaxSAT with a cardinality constraint (CC-MaxSat) problem and its monotone version, the Maximum Coverage problem. In the CC-MaxSat problem, we are given a CNF formula \u03a6 consisting of m clauses and n variables, and a positive integer k that fully covers the entire universe. This negative result defines the boundary for potential positive outcomes. In particular, to expect an FPT algorithm that improves by a factor of (1 - 1/e), we need to assume additional structure within the input families. This naturally leads to families in which each set has a bounded size, or each element appears in bounded sets, a concept that has been previously explored.\n\nSkowron and Faliszewski [27] demonstrated that if we work with set families where each element in U appears in at most p sets, there exists an algorithm that, for a given \u03f5 > 0, runs in time (p/\u03f5)^O(k) * n^O(1) and provides a subfamily F' of size k that is a (1-\u03f5)-approximation. These types of FPT-approximation algorithms are referred to as FPT-approximation Schemes (FPT-ASes). For the case of p = 2, Manurangsi [22] independently achieved a similar outcome. Jain et al. [18] extended these settings by examining Kd,d-free set systems (i.e., where no d sets share d elements). They also analyzed Kd,d-free formulas, where the clause-variable incidence bipartite graph of the formula excludes Kd,d as an induced subgraph. They demonstrated that, for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists an algorithm for Kd,d-free formulas with an approximation ratio of (1-\u03f5) and a runtime of 2^O((dk/\u03f5)^d) * (n + m)^O(1). For the Maximum Coverage problem on Kd,d-free set families, they obtained an FPT-AS with a runtime of (dk/\u03f5)^O(dk) * n^O(1). By combining these findings with Theorem 1.1, the following conclusion is reached.\n\nCorollary 1.2.",
        "The algebraic theory of block codes is highly developed, resulting in sophisticated classes of codes accompanied by effective decoding algorithms. In contrast, algebraic general constructions for convolutional codes are rare, and most convolutional codes with favorable designed distance have been identified through computer searches. Due to the lack of straightforward algebraic methods to construct generator matrices for convolutional codes with good distance properties, several researchers have extended well-known block code classes into the convolutional domain. This approach was pioneered by Massey, Costello, and Justesen, who utilized cyclic or quasi-cyclic block codes [19, 20, 27]. Subsequently, many authors have expanded upon this idea [9, 22, 32, 14]. The core concept involves establishing a link between the generator polynomials of quasi-cyclic block codes and the generator matrices of convolutional codes. A key property of this connection is that it allows the free distance of the convolutional code to be bounded below by the minimum distance of the associated cyclic or quasi-cyclic block code. Within this framework, numerous constructions of convolutional codes with designed free distance have been developed based on different block code classes, such as Reed-Solomon or Reed-Muller codes. Additionally, in [31], the authors refined the parameters of these constructions to introduce the first Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) convolutional code, i.e., a convolutional code whose free distance meets the generalized Singleton bound presented in [30], provided the field size is congruent to 1 modulo the code length. Subsequently, other MDS convolutional codes for restricted parameter sets have been introduced [12, 29]. Notably, circulant Cauchy matrices were used for the construction of MDS 2D convolutional codes in [7, 8], which was later adapted for MDS 1D convolutional codes in [24]. All these codes are designed to achieve large free distances.\n\nIn the realm of convolutional codes, the objective is to build codes capable of correcting as many errors as possible across different time intervals. This capability is measured by column distances. Although column distance is arguably the most fundamental distance measure for convolutional codes (see [18, pag. 162]), little is known about constructing convolutional codes with large column distances. Furthermore, a large free distance does not ensure the largest possible column distances. Codes that maximize column distances are termed Maximum Distance Profile (MDP) codes, introduced in [16] and further explored in [13]. MDP convolutional codes are analogous to MDS block codes within a time interval and are thus considered more suitable analogs of MDS block codes than MDS convolutional codes. Practically, these codes have been shown to be highly effective for sequential transmission over erasure channels and low-delay streaming applications [6, 10, 26, 33].",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, with improved readability, coherence, and flow:\n\n# The Evolution of Optical Networks in the Era of AI and Big Data\n\nThe convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics has ushered in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0)[1]. This transformation is characterized by two parallel developments: the increasing digitization of the physical world and the emergence of bandwidth-intensive services.\n\n## Digital Transformation and Network Demands\n\nThe physical world is rapidly evolving toward digitization, driven by advances in sensor technologies and ubiquitous Internet access. This digital transformation has created an always-connected world where physical entities maintain digital counterparts. Simultaneously, novel services such as telepresence holography and tactile robotics control are proliferating at an unprecedented rate.\n\nThese dual forces are dramatically impacting global data consumption and Internet traffic growth[2]. According to Cisco's recent report[3], annual global IP traffic is projected to reach 4.8 ZB by 2022\u2014a threefold increase over five years, with no signs of deceleration. This growth has placed immense pressure on optical core networks, necessitating fundamental reconsideration of their design, planning, operation, and management to achieve greater efficiency.\n\n## Evolution of Optical Transport Networks\n\nOptical transport networks have evolved in response to this unprecedented traffic growth in several ways:\n\n### Architectural Advancement\nCore optical networks have progressed from opaque to translucent and finally to fully transparent operation. Advances in optical components, transmission technologies, and photonic switching have made all-optical/transparent core networks a reality, significantly reducing costs, footprint, and power consumption by eliminating unnecessary O-E-O regenerations[4,5,6].\n\n### Elastic Optical Networks (EONs)\nTo address the looming fiber capacity crunch, elastic optical networks have emerged as a promising solution. EONs divide the spectrum into flexible slices, breaking away from traditional rigid frequency grids in WDM networks. This enables adaptive spectrum provisioning tailored to specific bandwidth requirements and transmission quality needs[7,8,9].\n\n### Network Resilience\nAs optical transport networks become increasingly crucial for the information society, resilience has gained paramount importance[10]. Protection against single link failures is now an integral part of network planning, with dedicated path protection being widely deployed for its rapid recovery and operational simplicity[11,12].\n\n[Content continues with subsequent sections maintaining similar improvements in structure and clarity...]\n\n*Note: The remaining sections follow the same pattern of improvement, maintaining the technical accuracy while enhancing readability through better organization, clearer transitions, and more precise language.

        "Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision and machine learning, used to categorize images into predefined classes of objects.  Unlike traditional image classification where the entire image is available for processing at once, sequential image classification processes images as long sequences, one pixel at a time. Deep learning techniques, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and deep neural networks (DNNs), have been extensively used and well-developed for image classification. RNNs, whose development is attributed to authors [1], [2], and [3], are widely believed to outperform CNNs and DNNs for sequential data.\n\nThis study has two main parts. First, we review state-of-the-art network architectures for sequential image classification. Second, we introduce a novel feature construction method aimed at reducing training time while increasing both training and testing accuracy.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the basics of recurrent neural networks, including deep independent RNNs and temporal convolution networks. Section III details our proposed feature construction method.  Section IV presents performance results for state-of-the-art networks, as well as results for LSTM and BiLSTM architectures.

        "AlphaZero is a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that has demonstrated remarkable achievements in two-player, zero-sum games such as chess, shogi, and Go, reaching superhuman levels of play. It achieves this by simulating self-play matches using a perfect model of its environment (the game rules) to train a neural network, which learns a value function and action selection priors over states. These priors guide a lookahead search at each turn, resulting in an improved policy. AlphaZero then refines its play through policy iteration based on the self-play matches generated under these improved policies.\n\nDespite its success, AlphaZero's training faces challenges in terms of sample efficiency. To reach superhuman performance in 19x19 Go, AlphaZero needs hundreds of millions of training samples. The efficiency of AlphaZero's training depends on the distribution of states it visits and trains on during self-play matches. While AlphaZero has a perfect model of the game environment, it cannot explore every possible state. Therefore, it trains on states visited on-policy during simulated self-play matches, which start from the game's initial state. To facilitate exploration, AlphaZero takes exploratory actions during self-play, allowing it to learn from a variety of states and make better action selections in the future.\n\nHowever, AlphaZero's training process has limitations. It often reaches terminal states early in self-play matches, limiting exploration deeper into the game tree. The exploration mechanisms used by AlphaZero lead to training under weaker policies, slowing down policy iteration. Additionally, AlphaZero produces a single noisy value target from full self-play matches, hindering value training. To address these limitations and improve sample efficiency, a more effective search control strategy is needed. This involves strategically selecting the starting state of simulated trajectories based on specific principles.\n\nOne proposed solution is the Go-Exploit search control strategy for AlphaZero, inspired by previous approaches like Go-Explore and Exploring Restart Distributions. Go-Exploit maintains an archive of states of interest and selects the start state for self-play trajectories either uniformly from the archive or from the initial game state. This strategy aims to continually explore new states, revisit states of interest, reduce bias in learning targets, and produce independent value targets for training. Experimental results show that Go-Exploit outperforms standard AlphaZero in sample efficiency, especially in games like Connect Four and 9x9 Go.\n\nComparisons with KataGo, a more sample-efficient reimplementation of AlphaZero, indicate that Go-Exploit can achieve faster learning and improved efficiency. By adhering to guiding principles and implementing an effective search control strategy, Go-Exploit demonstrates superior learning capabilities compared to AlphaZero.",
        "The selectivity of a selection query on a set of objects in a database is the probability of a random object in the database satisfying the query predicate. Selectivity estimation, a key step in query optimization, is used by databases to estimate the costs of alternative query processing plans and choose the best one. Consequently, selectivity estimation has been extensively studied over the past few decades [30, 35, 42, 43, 45]. Historically, selectivity estimation has been data-driven, constructing or dynamically maintaining a small-size synopsis of the data distribution using histograms or random samples to minimize estimation error. While effective in low dimensions, these methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. As a result, interest in learning-based methods for selectivity estimation has grown over the years [23, 31, 32, 33, 37, 39]. Many different methods have been proposed that work with the data distribution, observed selectivities from query workloads, or a combination of both. At a high level, many of these techniques build a model of the underlying data distribution to answer queries. Although they perform well in practice, often outperforming traditional counterparts, a theoretical understanding of this line of work is lacking.\n\nThis leads to the natural question of whether selectivity can be learned efficiently from a small sample of query selectivities alone, without access to the data distribution. Hu et al. [26] formalize the learnability of the selectivity estimation problem in this setting, using the agnostic-learning framework [24], an extension of the classical PAC learning framework for real-valued functions. Here, one is given a set of sample queries from a fixed query distribution and their respective selectivities (the training set), with the goal of efficiently constructing a data distribution such that the selectivity of a new query from the same query distribution can be answered with high accuracy. They show that for a wide class of range queries, the selectivity query can be learned within error \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1) with probability at least 1 - \u03b4 using a training set of size \u03b5^-O(1) log \u03b4^-1, where the exponent of \u03b5 depends on the query type; see [26] for a precise statement of their results. Informally, learnability implies that the performance of a model on the training set generalizes to unseen queries from the same distribution. This reduces the task of learning to finding a model of the data distribution that best fits the training data, i.e., Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM).\n\nAlthough Hu et al. [26] prove a sharp bound on the sample complexity, their algorithm for ERM is prohibitively long and produces a data distribution of large size. They also present fast heuristics to construct small-size data distributions but do not provide any guarantee on the performance concerning the best data distribution fitting the training set. This raises the question of how to develop a provably efficient and effective algorithm for constructing the best data distribution (in a given family) from a training set. Note that the size of the distribution computed by [26] can further be reduced to O(\u03b5^-2) by choosing an \u03b5-approximation, with an increase of \u03b5 in the error; see [22] and Section 3 below. However, the aim is to compute a small-size distribution (whose performance is comparable to the best data distribution) directly and efficiently, without first constructing a large-size distribution.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\nAge of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric in modern communication systems, particularly for delay-sensitive applications where timely information updates are crucial. AoI, defined as the elapsed time since the generation of the last successfully received system information, plays a vital role in status update systems such as family care, security alerts, and environmental monitoring scenarios [1, 2].\n\nThe academic community has shown significant interest in AoI research [3-13], exploring various aspects of this metric. Initial studies focused on fundamental update policies, such as the zero-wait policy [3] and queue management in buffer-aided schemes [4]. These investigations examined system performance under different queuing models, including M/M/1 and M/M/1/2 systems with first-come-first-served (FCFS) policies. Further research extended to Poisson arrival processes with last-generated-first-served (LGFS) strategies [5].\n\nEnergy constraints in communication systems have led researchers to investigate age minimization problems under power limitations. Studies have addressed energy-aware adaptive status update policies for information refresh mechanisms [6], optimal sensing scheduling for energy harvesting systems [7], and integer battery policies with threshold characterizations [8]. Notably, the minimum average AoI has been shown to correspond to the optimal threshold for the highest energy state.\n\nPacket retransmission has emerged as another crucial aspect of AoI research. Studies have examined perfect feedback channels with best-effort uniform updating policies [9], peak-age optimization for short packets using hybrid ARQ (HARQ) protocols [10], and average age minimization under retransmission constraints [11]. Research has also revealed that higher upper bounds on transmission rounds generally lead to higher average age [12]. The relationship between average age and normalized energy consumption has been explored, considering both sensing and transmission energy [12, 13].",
        "The field of computer vision has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in areas like image recognition, video object detection, and tracking, due to the progress in deep learning techniques. However, deep neural networks typically require a large amount of labeled data to adjust their parameters, posing challenges in scenarios where labeling data is labor-intensive. As a result, the concept of few-shot learning has gained increasing attention. Few-shot learning involves training a model to classify N categories, each with k labeled samples, referred to as N-way and k-shot classification tasks. The model then predicts classes for new examples based on this limited labeled data, divided into a support set (annotated data) and a query set (new data from the N categories).\n\nVarious approaches have been proposed for few-shot learning, generally based on meta-training using base classes to simulate few-shot tasks in a training stage. The model is then tested on real few-shot tasks of novel classes in a meta-testing phase to evaluate its performance. These methods fall into three categories: metric learning, teacher-student network approaches, and transduction methods, each with distinct strategies for addressing few-shot learning challenges.\n\nOne common issue with meta-training is the requirement for a substantial number of labeled base class examples, and the need to define the task type (N and k values) beforehand, limiting the model's applicability to only specific types of few-shot tasks. To address these challenges, a new approach called TrainPro-FSL is introduced, which leverages self-supervised learning to eliminate the episodic meta-training phase and improve generalization. By training a feature extractor using unlabeled images and utilizing metric learning for real few-shot tasks, TrainPro-FSL overcomes the limitations of traditional meta-training paradigms.\n\nIn addition, attention mechanisms are integrated into both meta-training and task-training phases to enhance the classification accuracy of the algorithm. These attention structures optimize the neural network's performance by focusing on relevant features during training and inference. Through a series of experiments on the miniImageNet dataset, TrainPro-FSL demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in few-shot learning, showcasing its effectiveness in handling diverse types of few-shot tasks.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section II covers related works, Section III details the methodology of TrainPro-FSL, Section IV presents experimental results on standard vision datasets, and finally, Section V concludes the study by summarizing the contributions and outcomes of the proposed algorithm.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nThe construction industry remains largely labor-intensive, with on-site management and operations primarily dependent on manual judgment [1]. This traditional approach makes construction site management both challenging and inefficient. While high-resolution monitoring cameras now enable remote and dynamic site monitoring, significant manual intervention is still required [2].\n\nThe recent advancement of computer vision technology has opened new possibilities for automating tasks beyond human visual capabilities, leading to improved safety and production efficiency [3]. Cameras have become increasingly vital in construction management, with practitioners embracing computer vision-powered automated applications [4]. For instance, video surveillance can now identify unsafe worker behaviors and construction risks [5], including the detection of workers not wearing personal protective equipment [6-11]. This integration of computer vision technology in construction automation has garnered significant attention from both academic and industrial sectors.\n\nDeep learning object detection algorithms have evolved rapidly in recent years, with numerous new approaches emerging. Both detection speed and accuracy have improved substantially, with recognition accuracy reaching 98% or higher in suitable applications. Computer vision technology based on deep learning demonstrates considerable advantages over traditional image processing and recognition methods [12], particularly in detection speed, algorithm robustness, and automated feature extraction. Consequently, incorporating deep learning methods into construction site management object detection represents a promising new direction [13].\n\nHowever, deep learning algorithms require extensive data, necessitating specific construction-related image datasets for effective object detection on construction sites. The construction industry's highly specialized nature presents unique challenges in both image collection and annotation, explaining the scarcity of well-annotated construction-specific images in popular datasets like ImageNet.\n\nTo advance object detection research in construction, a comprehensive image dataset featuring construction site-specific objects (workers, materials, machines, layouts) is essential. Current construction site image datasets are limited in both size and scope, primarily focusing on people, personal protective equipment (PPE), and select machinery. This limitation stems from several factors:\n\n1. Construction site images are more difficult to obtain than those of common objects due to security restrictions and limited public access.\n2. Conventional on-site monocular cameras struggle to capture objects from diverse perspectives, potentially leading to model overfitting.\n3. The complex and cluttered site environment makes annotation both challenging and costly, requiring specialized knowledge for accurate object identification.\n\nA comprehensive object detection dataset for construction sites would significantly benefit the industry by:\n- Providing a foundation for developing deep-learning-based detection models\n- Enabling thorough testing of object detection algorithms\n\nThis research aims to address this need by creating a general object detection dataset for construction sites. The methodology encompasses:\n- Category selection\n- Data acquisition\n- Data cleaning\n- Data annotation\n- Dataset analysis\n- Experimental analysis and benchmarking\n\nThe resulting dataset comprises 19,846 images containing 286,201 objects across 15 categories. The data collection involved various equipment, including monocular cameras, UAVs, and hook visualization devices. A team of 35 Civil Engineering students was trained for data processing and annotation, followed by comprehensive statistical analysis. The dataset was validated using mainstream object detection algorithms, yielding satisfactory results and establishing benchmarks for future research. All images and annotations are freely available online, with regular updates planned to expand object varieties and enhance the dataset.",
        "Recent advances in Language Models (LMs) and their ability to use tools have led to the development of semi-autonomous agents like WebGPT, AutoGPT, and ChatGPT Plugins that interact with the real world.  While promising, this transition from text-based interaction to real-world action amplifies the risks associated with deploying LMs.  An agent's failure to follow instructions can now lead to serious consequences, ranging from financial loss when using banking tools to potentially life-threatening situations when operating robots.  Given these potential real-world impacts, even low-probability risks must be identified before deployment.  However, the open-ended nature of these risks and the complexity of testing make this a significant challenge.  Traditional testing relies on human experts manually setting up specific tools and sandbox environments, limiting the scope and scalability of risk assessment.\n\nInspired by simulator-based testing in fields like autonomous driving, we introduce ToolEmu (Figure 1), an LM-based tool emulation framework.  ToolEmu is designed to identify realistic failures in LM agents across a diverse set of tools, even in long-tail scenarios, and facilitate the development of safer agents through automated evaluation.\n\nOur framework's core utilizes an LM to emulate tools and their execution environments. Unlike traditional, statically programmed emulators, ToolEmu leverages recent advancements in LMs (e.g., GPT-4) to emulate tool execution using only tool specifications and inputs. This eliminates the need for implementing each tool and its environment, enabling rapid prototyping and evaluation of even high-stakes tools lacking existing APIs or sandbox implementations.  For example, our emulator can emulate traffic control tools, revealing a risk assessment failure in GPT-4 (Figure 2e). To further enhance risk assessment, we introduce an adversarial emulator for red-teaming, which automatically identifies potential failure modes and creates scenarios likely to trigger them. Using these emulators, we identify a range of potentially severe, long-tail failures in current LM agents (Figure 2). Human evaluators judged over 80% of the 200 emulated tool execution trajectories as realistic. Of the severe failures observed in ChatGPT-3.5 using the emulated terminal tool, 6 out of 7 were reproducible on a real bash terminal. Notably, replicating these failures in a real environment took us approximately 8 hours, compared to under 15 minutes in ToolEmu.\n\nFor scalable and quantitative risk assessment, we developed an LM-based safety evaluator that analyzes emulated trajectories, detects risky actions, and assesses their consequences.  This automated evaluator identifies 73.1% of the failures identified by a majority vote of three human evaluators, comparable to the 78.8% average for a single human evaluator. Human evaluation confirmed that 68.8% of the failures identified by our emulator and evaluator were genuinely risky and realistically emulated.  To quantify the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, we also designed an automated helpfulness evaluator, assessing how effectively agents fulfill instructions without compromising safety.  Both evaluators demonstrate agreement rates with human annotations comparable to inter-annotator agreement.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate how our emulators and evaluators can build a benchmark to quantitatively assess LM agents across diverse tools and scenarios.",
        "The deployment of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) within the US National Airspace has witnessed significant growth, driven by applications such as remote sensing, package delivery, and emergency response. These operations take place in airspace shared with other sUAS and are subject to restrictions like no-fly zones around airports, national parks, and schools. The increasing numbers of sUAS have led to a rise in reported incidents, often linked to issues such as hardware or software malfunctions, human errors (like disregard for rules and regulations), or external factors such as radio interference and adverse weather conditions. Consequently, sUAS operators are required to obtain permission to fly in controlled airspace. For instance, in the USA, Remote Pilots In Command (RPICs) need to seek flight authorization through the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC), allowing access to airspace below 400 feet above ground level (AGL), defining where RPICs can fly and providing air traffic controllers with visibility into ongoing sUAS operations. However, the current system does not account for specific flight details, environmental factors, drone characteristics, or pilot competencies.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with research support from NASA, is developing a unified ecosystem known as the UAS Traffic Management System (UTM) to manage large numbers of sUAS in shared low-altitude airspace. The UTM system relies on digitally exchanging planned flight information for each RPIC. Factors influencing an sUAS's capability to perform a mission safely include its features (such as weight, size, and sensors), suitability for flight, operating environment, planned flight details, and the human operator's qualifications and skills. While still in development, the UTM will mandate operators to submit a Performance Authorization Request (PAR) outlining how their sUAS's assets, services, personnel, and maintenance protocols ensure safe operation. The software for the UTM is critical for airspace safety, as its decisions can impact airspace safety or compromise it, especially in safety-critical operations like rescue missions.\n\nEvaluating PARs currently relies on manual processes, lacking scalability and being prone to human error. Automation is crucial for handling the anticipated volume of sUAS flight requests in populated airspaces efficiently. A fully automated flight authorization system could swiftly approve or deny most flight requests, potentially incorporating Machine Learning (ML) for scalability as data accumulates over time. However, the opacity of ML-based systems raises concerns about algorithmic fairness and transparency in automated flight authorizations.\n\nDue to limited available data, the challenge exists in training an unbiased initial system for automated decision-making within the UTM framework. Nevertheless, this presents an opportunity to construct a system from scratch that integrates fairness and transparency considerations early on. Understanding the factors crucial to UTM stakeholders is vital for developing a fair and transparent automated flight authorization system.",
        "Semantic layout manipulation involves editing an image by altering its semantic label map, such as changing the semantic layout or adding and removing objects, as shown in Figure 1. This technique has numerous practical applications in image editing, including photo editing [1], image retargeting [2], restoration [3], composition [4], and image melding [5]. However, it remains relatively underexplored due to the complexities of predicting intricate, non-rigid spatial deformations and the domain gap between the input image and the target semantic layout. The key challenge is to develop an effective method for transferring visual patterns from the input image to the target semantic layout.\n\nEarlier methods [2], [6], [7], [8] in image synthesis allowed users to designate semantic regions for guided image manipulation. These techniques employed non-parametric modeling of patches [6], [8] or patch-based copy-pasting strategies [2], [5], [7], [9], [10] to create new images. While effective for generating stationary textures or repetitive structures, they struggled to generate new semantic structures.\n\nRecently, advancements in deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have significantly improved structure-guided image manipulation. Champandard et al. [12] developed a semantic-aware loss on a pretrained classifier [13] for semantic-guided artwork generation. Zhu et al. [14] optimized the latent code of a generative model for layout-constrained image generation. More recently, guided inpainting methods [15], [16], [17] have been introduced for manipulating natural images. These approaches mask certain regions of images and generate new pixels to align with user-provided edge scribbles. In the realm of semantic layout manipulation, recent work [3] extends inpainting networks by incorporating semantic label maps in the missing region as inputs. Despite promising results, this approach faces limitations: 1) it discards pixels within the masked region, potentially losing important visual details useful for manipulation, and 2) it lacks a spatial alignment mechanism to handle significant layout changes.\n\nConversely, methods utilizing attention-based warping [18], [19] have shown promise in global reference-based layout editing. Zhang et al. [18] introduced a cross-domain correspondence network to warp input images to desired layouts. Zheng et al. [19] proposed a spatial-channel attention method to align multi-scale visual features with a new layout. These methods can manage dramatic layout changes due to explicit warping. However, global layout editing does not consider contextual information from the input image or user manipulation intentions. Applying global warping for local tasks can inadvertently modify surrounding image content, which is undesirable. Moreover, the warping schemes of [18], [19] are computationally intensive, limiting them to low-resolution warping [18] or application to individual regions independently [19], which can result in a loss of visual details in the warped image. To address these challenges, we extend the guided image inpainting framework to include a warped version of the original image as an additional information source for local manipulation tasks.",
        "Present work. Firstly, we review the mini-batch training process and the existing effective tricks of GCNs, which can often make training faster and better for node classification tasks. Based on this, we propose two novel tricks for node classification tasks: GCN res Framework and Embedding Usage. By applying adaptive and initial residual connections, as well as softmax layer-aggregation, the GCN res Framework can help alleviate the over-smoothing problem. For instance, on ogbn-arxiv, our model demonstrated a 1.39% improvement in test accuracy compared to GCN. We also benchmarked our model against other baselines like DeeperGCN and GCNII to showcase significant gains. Moreover, the effectiveness of Embedding Usage was validated through experiments on ogbn-mag, ogbn-products, and ogbn-proteins, resulting in a notable 2.15% test accuracy boost on ogbn-mag. Lastly, we discovered that combining different strategies can often enhance various GCNs, such as elevating GraphSAGE's test accuracy from 78.70% to 81.54% on ogbn-products, achieving top performance among models based on SAGEConv and its variants.\n\nMore recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and their variants have successfully extended convolution and pooling operations to graphs, delivering strong performance across diverse domains like computer vision, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. Spatial-based GCNs like GCN, GraphSAGE, and GraphSAINT have started to supplant spectral-based GCNs due to their enhanced efficiency and flexibility. To tackle the scalability challenge of GCNs, researchers have proposed two minibatch training algorithms: sampling-based and clustering-based, to scale GCNs to large graphs. Tasks in graph representation learning can be segmented into node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, with node classification emerging as a popular benchmark for evaluating GCNs due to its clarity and simplicity.\n\nMuch effort has been directed towards refining the implementation of GCNs, exemplified by initiatives like the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), which has significantly advanced GCN research. Prior to the introduction of OGB datasets and its leaderboard, GCN studies lacked a standardized experimental protocol, leading to discrepancies in dataset splitting and evaluation methods that impeded fair comparison across different experiments. Additionally, using small graph datasets such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed in earlier studies posed challenges in transferring techniques to larger real-world graphs. Consequently, tricks that could enhance GCN performance were either inadequately emphasized in literature or embedded solely in source code. The advent of OGB datasets and leaderboard has underscored the importance of these tricks under more equitable evaluation standards and real-world graph scenarios, where the gains from employing such tricks sometimes surpass those achieved through model architecture improvements.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\n# Satellite Communication Systems: A Modern Perspective\n\n## Introduction\n\nSatellite communication has emerged as a focal point of research and development over the past decade, both in academic circles and industry. Its prominence stems from the ability to provide ubiquitous wireless coverage and uninterrupted service, particularly in regions beyond terrestrial cellular network coverage [1].\n\nSatellites can be categorized into three main types based on orbital height:\n- Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites\n- Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites\n- Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites\n\nWhile LEO satellites offer smaller coverage compared to their GEO and MEO counterparts, they present compelling advantages:\n- Reduced over-the-air delay\n- Lower path loss due to shorter link distance\n- More cost-effective deployment\n\nThese benefits have positioned mega-constellation LEO satellite systems as a promising technology for achieving global seamless communication service with substantial business potential.\n\n## Industry Developments and Standardization\n\nThe growing market opportunities have sparked numerous proposals from companies like OneWeb, Kuiper, and Starlink to deploy LEO satellite mega-constellations for global broadband access. Concurrently, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has initiated standardization efforts to integrate 5G New Radio (NR) with non-terrestrial networks (NTN) using satellite access:\n\n- Release 15: Identified deployment scenarios, channel models, and key NR impact areas [2]\n- Release 16: Studied features and modifications for NR adaptation in NTN [3]\n- Releases 17 and 18: Ongoing work addressing NR-based protocol challenges and NTN-specific performance enhancements\n\n## Beam Hopping Technology\n\nBeam hopping has emerged as a flexible technique in satellite communication, designed to address time-varying traffic demands of ground-based user equipment (UEs) while reducing payload weight and costs. This approach introduces a new dimension for improving communication performance by strategically illuminating specific portions of the satellite coverage area [4].\n\nKey advantages include:\n- Dynamic satellite resource adjustment\n- Reduced inter-beam interference\n- Potential for full bandwidth reuse with higher capacity\n\nThe industry has made significant progress in beam hopping implementation:\n- DVB-S2X standard introduced three frame structures (Formats 5-7) supporting beam hopping [5]\n- System-level simulations demonstrated beam hopping potential using a GEO satellite with 14 beams [6]\n- Advanced frameworks, such as cooperative multiagent deep reinforcement learning, have been proposed for optimizing beam hopping patterns and bandwidth allocation [7]\n\n## Current Research Focus\n\nThis paper examines an NR-based mega-constellation LEO satellite communication system utilizing satellites equipped with phased array antennas.",
        "The Cahn-Hilliard (CH) type models are effective numerical tools for simulating interfacial motion between various materials [8, 10, 11, 24, 26, 27, 31, 34, 41].  The local CH (LCH) equation, a well-known phase-field model with a history spanning a century [3, 4, 9, 12, 15, 25, 32, 36, 37], results from the variation of an energy functional in the Sobolev space H\u207b\u00b9.  The LCH equation can be viewed as an approximation of the nonlocal CH (NCH) model, where a differential term replaces the nonlocal convolution potential [17, 18].  \n\nThe NCH equation has garnered increasing attention and application in diverse fields ranging from physics and material science to finance and image processing [2, 11, 16, 33, 43], necessitating the development of effective numerical solution methods.  Due to its variational formulation, the exact solution of the phase-field model adheres to an energy dissipation law, reflecting thermodynamic consistency and mathematical well-posedness.  Consequently, the primary challenge in NCH equation simulation lies in discretizing nonlinear and nonlocal terms while preserving energy stability at the discrete level.  Unconditional energy stability, achieved when numerical stability is independent of the time step [10], is particularly desirable.  This property is crucial not only for long-time accurate simulations but also for handling stiffness, providing theoretical and practical advantages for numerical analysis and computation.  It underpins various numerical schemes for classical phase-field models, including convex splitting [20, 21], stabilized schemes [39, 42], invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) [43], scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) methods [29], and SAV variants [22, 28, 30].  The applicability of these methods to the nonlocal phase-field model, which lacks a high-order diffusion term [14, 20], merits investigation.\n\nHigh-order time discretization schemes offer advantages over lower-order schemes when large time steps are desired under specific accuracy requirements.  This motivates the development of high-order methods like SAV-RK (Runge-Kutta) [1, 19], SAV-GL (general linear time discretization) [40], and implicit-explicit BDFk SAV [23] for phase-field model simulations.\n\nThis paper aims to develop high-order linear time discretization schemes for the NCH equation and prove their unconditional energy stability at the semi-discrete level, extendable to the fully discrete setting. We employ the exponential semi-implicit scalar auxiliary variable (ESI-SAV) approach [30], a novel method successfully applied to gradient flow and dissipative systems. The ESI-SAV method introduces a scalar auxiliary variable, transforming the free energy into a logarithmic form (exploiting the boundedness and positivity of the original energy's exponential form). This allows explicit treatment of nonlinear terms and implicit treatment of linear terms, resulting in decoupled linear systems.  Crucially, the reformulated system retains the original energy dissipation law at both continuous and discrete levels.  Based on the ESI-SAV approach, we construct and analyze first- to fourth-order (in time) linear, unconditionally energy-stable schemes. These schemes are high-order accurate (third- and fourth-order in time), easy to implement (explicit linear system), and unconditionally energy-stable (with a discrete energy dissipation law).  Spatially, we employ second-order central differences.  To address the computational cost of the nonlocal terms, we utilize an efficient method based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) and fast conjugate gradient (FCG) approaches [29].\n\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the NCH model with a general nonlinear potential and its relationship to the LCH model.  Section 3 details the construction of high-order unconditionally energy-stable schemes for the NCH model using the ESI-SAV approach.  Section 4 presents numerical examples in 2D to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes.  We use *C*, with or without subscript, to denote a positive constant, which may take different values at different instances.",
        "The toll of the drug overdose epidemic in the United States is staggering; more than one hundred thousand people lost their lives to a drug overdose in 2021 alone. Opioids have been a major driver of the epidemic, with opioid overdose mortality in the U.S. increasing exponentially since 1979. Additionally, the rate of nonfatal drug overdose Emergency Medical Services (EMS) encounters involving opioids nearly doubled from January 2018 to March 2022.\n\nState-level efforts have shown moderate success in reducing the misuse of prescription opioids. However, these policies may have inadvertently contributed to increased opioid mortality by indirectly incentivizing illicit usage. For every fatal drug overdose, there are numerous nonfatal overdoses, and EMS data uniquely provide information on where nonfatal overdoses occur and details on patient residence, helping to understand the journey to overdose from a person's place of residence.\n\nNetwork analysis has proven useful for studying various public health issues, including disease transmission, diffusion of health-related behavior and information, and social support networks, all of which are relevant to opioid overdose. In the context of the opioid overdose crisis, social network analysis of Appalachians revealed that over half of the individuals in their data set had a first-degree relationship with someone who experienced an opioid overdose, with a higher proportion near city centers. Measures of network centrality and prominence can shed light on illicit opioid-seeking behavior.\n\nOser et al. introduced the concept of geographical discordance to drug overdoses for the first time. They found that individuals who traveled to counties other than their residence for substance abuse treatment were more likely to relapse with prescription opioids. Geographically discordant treatment efforts were more common among rural populations than suburban or urban ones. Johnson et al. studied trip distance to drug purchase arrest for various classes of controlled substances in Camden, New Jersey, showing a significant correlation between race, ethnicity, and trip distance, highlighting the relationship between geospatial segregation and drug purchase patterns. \n\nForati et al. used spatial network methods to analyze geographically discordant opioid overdoses in Milwaukee, Wisconsin between 2017 and 2020, focusing on fatal incidents. Their study was the first to analyze an overdose journey network. However, the trips quantified in these studies were relatively short and limited to a single locale.",
        "In recent years, machines have exponentially increased their ability to solve complex tasks (Sejnowski, 2018). The availability of learning algorithms for tasks such as facial and voice recognition, autonomous driving, and fraud detection has made machine learning a hot topic not just in specialized literature but also in the media. For decades, computer scientists have been developing algorithms that automatically adjust their actions to improve performance. As early as the 1950s, Arthur Samuel created a checkers-playing program that enhanced its skills by learning from past moves. This context is often cited as the origin of the term \"machine learning\" (ML). Since then, advances in data storage, transfer, and processing have enabled learning algorithms to play a crucial role in daily life.\n\nToday, ML is a valuable tool for business management, aiding in predicting key performance indicators and supporting decision-making across the value chain, including director appointments (Erel et al., 2018), product sales predictions (Bajari et al., 2019), and employee turnover (Ajit, 2016; Saradhi and Palshikar, 2011). Using data generated as a byproduct of economic activity positively impacts firm growth (Farboodi et al., 2019), and strong data analytics capabilities enhance corporate performance (Mikalef et al., 2019). Additionally, publicly accessible data sources covering information across firms, industries, and countries allow analysts and policymakers to study firm dynamics on a larger scale, including start-up fate (Guerzoni et al., 2019), product success (Munos et al., 2020), firm growth (Weinblat, 2018), and bankruptcy (Bargagli-Stoffi et al., 2020c).\n\nMost ML methods fall into two main categories: (i) unsupervised learning (UL) and (ii) supervised learning (SL) models. UL involves techniques that draw inferences from datasets without labeled responses, used for tasks like clustering and pattern mining. SL, on the other hand, is used for making predictions with labeled response values (i.e., discrete or continuous outcomes). SL methods utilize a known dataset with input data and response values, known as the training dataset, to learn how to predict labeled outcomes. The learned decision rules can then be applied to predict unknown outcomes from new data.",
        "Detailed semantic maps are crucial for autonomous vehicles. Most autonomous driving systems rely heavily on these maps for navigation and action planning, augmenting onboard sensor data with information about road areas, traffic signs, obstacles, and more. This is particularly valuable in challenging conditions like dense traffic, occluded scenes, or long distances where sensor performance degrades.  Commercial providers are developing increasingly detailed 3D high-definition maps with rich semantic information.  These maps are highly abstracted from the underlying sensor data, allowing for efficient storage, easy interpretation, and cross-vendor sharing.\n\nPrecise localization within these maps is essential for leveraging their full potential.  This localization must be reliable in all conditions, including GPS-denied areas and complex urban environments.  Traditional visual localization methods often rely on specific handcrafted or learned features as landmarks. However, many real-world maps, particularly those from third parties, lack these specific localization landmarks.\n\nA promising solution is to use the existing semantic and geometric information already present in the maps for higher-level tasks. This approach has several advantages.  First, it enables localization across various existing and future map formats. Second, semantic information is readily available from sensor data through existing segmentation networks often already deployed for other perception tasks. Finally, semantics are largely invariant to environmental changes like weather or season and across different sensor modalities.\n\nOur camera-based localization approach draws inspiration from direct image alignment methods used in odometry estimation [1] and map-relative tracking [2]. We recover precise vehicle pose by aligning camera frames to virtual map views rendered from the semantic map.  Starting with an initial pose estimate (e.g., from GPS or place recognition), our system directly optimizes the vehicle pose, enabling real-time localization.  Requiring only semantically segmented camera images and ubiquitous odometry input, our approach avoids the need for specialized localization landmarks. This versatility makes it applicable to diverse areas, from indoor augmented reality to large-scale outdoor navigation for autonomous vehicles.\n\nOur main contributions are:\n\n* A camera-based localization approach using image alignment with semantic map elements as landmarks.\n* A novel, probabilistically sound semantic image alignment loss function to maximize map-sensor consistency.\n* Extensive evaluation on three datasets with diverse map formats and ablation studies demonstrating the efficacy of our method.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nGiven the extensive research in vehicle localization, we focus our review on image-based methods and relevant approaches utilizing semantics or direct image alignment.",
        "compact and lightweight as possible to enhance the robot's overall performance. However, achieving the desired balance between weight and power is challenging and requires careful selection and design of the motor and transmission system.\n\nQuasi-Direct Drive Actuators (QDDs) have been instrumental in advancing legged robots' capabilities, as they combine a powerful motor with a low-ratio transmission. This design approach effectively reduces output mechanical impedance (OMI) and the overall mass of the actuator while still meeting the necessary torque and power requirements. This innovation has allowed robots to achieve high-speed and robust locomotion, essential for performing dynamic and demanding actions.",
        "Over the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in efforts to develop efficient uncertainty quantification approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with random inputs. Typically, these random inputs arise from a lack of precise measurements or a limited understanding of realistic model parameters, such as permeability coefficients in diffusion problems and refraction coefficients in acoustic problems [38, 11, 12].\n\nDesigning a surrogate model or calculating statistics, such as the mean and variance, for PDEs with random inputs, is of great interest, particularly when the inputs are high-dimensional. The Monte Carlo method (MCM) and its variants are among the direct methods for computing these statistics [5, 13]. In MCM, numerous sample points of the random inputs are generated based on their probability density functions, and for each sample, the corresponding deterministic problem is solved using existing numerical methods. The statistics of the stochastic solution are then estimated by aggregating the results of these deterministic solutions. While the Monte Carlo method is straightforward to implement, it converges slowly, typically requiring a large number of sample points, and does not provide a surrogate model, which limits its applications.\n\nTo enhance efficiency, the stochastic collocation method (SCM) and the stochastic Galerkin method (SGM) have been developed, which are generally more efficient for solving PDEs with moderate-dimensional random inputs [37, 38, 39, 40, 32, 41].",
        "Planning is a central problem in Artificial Intelligence, the objective of which is to generate a plan of actions at a symbolic level, starting from an initial state, to achieve a predefined goal [1]. However, planning in AI poses multiple challenges, particularly those related to the formalization and reasoning about actions, plans, change, time, and objectives.  It also raises issues related to robustness in handling partially known world states or non-deterministic actions, algorithmic problems in plan generation, and problems of execution control, reactivity to unforeseen environmental changes, and adaptation of existing plans.\n\nClassical planning experienced considerable growth due to the richness of modeling languages and the efficiency of plan generation systems.  Nevertheless, classical planning suffered from a weakness stemming from two strong simplifying assumptions:  the availability of perfect knowledge, at all times, of the system state and the effects of actions, and the certainty that changes in the system state result solely from the execution of planned actions. To address this weakness, the field of planning under uncertainty [2] emerged, proposing the integration of actions with probabilistic effects and then additive utility functions on goals, leading to a family of planning approaches based on decision theory [3] and using representation languages traditionally known in artificial intelligence: logic, constraints, or Bayesian networks.  The use of these representation languages led to a significant increase in the complexity of plan generation algorithms, the resolution of which became a challenge for the AI community. This is how the idea of using multi-agent systems arose among researchers.\n\nIndeed, extending planning to the multi-agent systems framework led to distributed planning [4], [11], in which the planning domain is distributed among a set of agents. These agents can be cooperative, meaning they share a common global objective and complementary capabilities to achieve it, or individualistic, meaning they have individual objectives that they can achieve without external assistance. In both cases, agents must be able to generate plans that allow the achievement of either sub-goals necessary for a global objective or individual objectives.  There is some existing work on distributed planning in the literature. We cite, among others, [177], [178], [179], [180].\n\nThe agent paradigm is becoming increasingly important for its ability to address complex systems characterized by indeterminism, emergence, and unpredictable evolution. It is very effective for managing the heterogeneous nature of a system's components, modeling interactions between these components, and attempting to understand the resulting emergent phenomena. This is linked to the fact that an agent possesses behavior, characterized mainly by four properties [5]:\n\n* **Autonomy or Proactivity:** The ability to act without external intervention; initiative-taking.\n* **Sensitivity:** The ability to perceive the environment or other agents.\n* **Locality:** Limitations in perception and actions.\n* **Flexibility:** Reaction to perceived changes.\n\nIndeed, an agent is not limited to reacting only to method invocations, as is often the case in the object paradigm, but also to any other observable change in its environment.  Taking these changes into account automatically translates into a set of new actions that the agent must execute. The determination of these actions depends on the nature of the agent [6].  For example, if the agent is rational, the actions to be determined must not conflict with the agent's utility function; if the agent is goal-oriented, these actions must not conflict with the agent's goal; if the agent is reactive with a model, these actions are predetermined by a set of rules, etc.\n\nThe agent's behavior thus offers advantages, but the new actions to be executed by the agent, in order to take into account the unpredictable changes that characterize its environment, can create a problem during distributed planning. In classical planning, the set of actions to be planned is defined beforehand and does not undergo any changes, thus ensuring the reliability of the generated plan until the end of its execution.  However, in distributed planning, each agent may experience changes in its set of actions to be planned, following unpredictable changes in its environment. Due to changes in the set of actions, the plan the agent was executing becomes obsolete because it does not consider the new actions the agent must execute to accommodate the unpredictable changes in its environment. The agent is therefore forced to generate a new plan. Consequently, the need for a dynamic planning approach that can generate new plans at any time, as changes occur, to take into account new actions becomes self-evident. This represents the focal point of our work, in which we propose a new dynamic distributed planning approach capable of taking into account changes that may occur in the set of actions to be planned. Our approach fits within the context of distributed planning for distributed plans where each agent can produce its own plans.  According to our approach, plan generation is based on constraint satisfaction using genetic algorithms.",
        "Data poisoning attacks pose a significant threat to neural network classifiers. These attacks can greatly impact the classification accuracy by manipulating the training samples or testing data. Studies have shown that even a small percentage of poisoned samples can lead to misclassifications at a high success rate. Various types of data poisoning attacks exist, highlighting the urgent need for effective defenses to safeguard neural networks.\n\nWhile heuristic defenses have been proposed to counter data poisoning attacks, the security levels of these defenses are difficult to quantify. To address this challenge, certified defenses, such as randomized smoothing, loss-based defenses, and differential privacy-based defenses, have been introduced. Among these, randomized smoothing stands out as a versatile defense mechanism that can provide certified robustness for each testing data, regardless of the training algorithm used.\n\nHowever, existing randomized smoothing defenses have mainly focused on specific smoothing schemes, lacking a comprehensive framework to defend against data poisoning attacks. To fill this gap, the proposed framework of random selection-based defenses extends the concept of randomized smoothing, demonstrating the robustness of random selection schemes that meet specific criteria, including the bagging technique. By incorporating prior knowledge about the training set and the poisoning model, the framework can enhance the certified radius, especially in the presence of a weak poisoning model.\n\nThe framework also introduces a two-phase classification strategy to boost robustness, particularly when the level of prior knowledge about the training set is high. Additionally, the training algorithms leverage a weight balance method to address the challenge of low certified accuracy, particularly with a small selection size. Through the framework, the certified accuracy of the defenses, evaluated across the MNIST, MNIST, and CIFAR-10, outperforms the existing defenses, highlighting the practical relevance of the proposed approach.",
        "Most autonomous driving systems rely primarily on a combination of cameras and lidar for perception, with radar sensors taking a back-seat role. Cen and Newman presented a successful application of a scanning radar sensor to largescale outdoor ego-motion estimation, inspiring a resurgence of research into radar-based perception and navigation systems. Radar, with its longer wavelength, is more robust to precipitation compared to lidar, making it a potential key for enabling self-driving vehicles to operate in adverse weather. The ultimate goal of this research is to match and even surpass the performance of lidar-based algorithms in adverse conditions.\n\nPrevious works in radar-based odometry and place recognition have shown significant progress, but they have limitations, such as reliance on handcrafted feature extraction, correlative scan matching, or supervised learning algorithms. While it has been demonstrated that learned features can outperform hand-crafted features, the scalability of correlative scan matching systems to large-scale mapping and localization remains a question. To address these limitations, a new method is proposed, aiming to learn features directly from radar data without the need for groundtruth pose information.\n\nIn this work, an unsupervised radar odometry pipeline is presented, approaching the state of the art, as reported on the Oxford Radar RobotCar Dataset.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nDomain generalized semantic segmentation aims to improve pixel-level semantic label predictions across multiple unseen target domains while training exclusively on the source domain. However, the domain shift between source and target domains causes models trained on source data to perform poorly on unseen target data, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. In domain generalization (DG), this reduced performance on unseen domains stems primarily from overfitting to the source domain. Since the model receives no information about target domains during training\u2014not even unlabeled target images, unlike in domain adaptation (DA)\u2014it becomes overly specialized to the statistical distribution of the source data.\n\nRecent studies [7, 29, 41, 42] have attempted to learn domain-generalized content features by 'removing' domain-specific style information to prevent source domain overfitting. Based on the established correlation between feature covariance matrices and style [13, 14], these approaches assumed that whitening [23, 30, 50, 53] style-related feature elements would leave only content features. However, since content and style are not orthogonal concepts, whitening style information can lead to the loss of essential semantic content needed for accurate category prediction. Consequently, these models struggle to make precise predictions from incomplete content features, as demonstrated in Fig. 1c.\n\nWe introduce WildNet, a novel domain generalized semantic segmentation network that learns domain-generalized semantic features by 'extending' both content and style to the wild. While previous works [22, 45, 62] have utilized diverse styles from external sources\u2014such as ImageNet [11] for real styles and Painter by Numbers [38] for artificial styles\u2014they overlooked that superior generalization requires learning both varied styles and contents. Our approach differs by naturally learning domain-generalized semantic information through leveraging diverse contents and styles from the wild, without forcing style whitening.\n\nTo achieve this wild extension of content and style, we implement four effective learning methods:\n\n1. Feature stylization: Diversifies source feature styles by transferring statistical properties from wild features across multiple layers\n2. Content extension learning: Reduces source content overfitting by increasing intra-class content variability in the latent embedding space\n3. Style extension learning: Prevents style overfitting by encouraging adaptation to various wild-extended styles\n4. Semantic consistency regularization: Ensures consistent semantic information capture despite content and style extensions\n\nThrough extensive multi-domain experiments, WildNet demonstrates superior performance in domain generalization for semantic segmentation.\n\nKey Contributions:\n- Introduction of WildNet, a novel network leveraging diverse wild content and styles for domain-generalized semantic segmentation\n- Development of four learning techniques enabling reliable predictions on unseen target domains\n- Superior experimental performance across multiple domains in semantic segmentation domain generalization tasks\n\nFigure 1 demonstrates our results: (a) shows an unseen domain image, with models trained on GTAV [46] and validated on Cityscapes [10]. The baseline model (b) achieves only 35.16% mIoU due to source domain overfitting. RobustNet [7] (c) marginally improves to 36.58% mIoU through style whitening but still shows limited generalization. Our WildNet (d) achieves superior results with 44.62% mIoU through wild-based learning. Additional qualitative results are available in the supplementary material.",
        "The proliferation of complex data, such as non-Euclidean graphs and multi-view data, driven by advancements in information technology, presents significant challenges for data analysis.  Multi-view data arises from diverse sources with varying characteristics. Multi-relational graphs, a specific type of multi-view data, contain multiple relations over a single set of vertices (Qu et al. 2017).  A prime example is seen in social networks, where users (nodes) and their profiles (attributes) interact through various relationship types like friendship, colleagues, or co-following.\n\nClustering offers a practical approach to analyze these rich multi-relational graphs by identifying unique node cluster patterns.  Effective multi-relational clustering leverages the consistency and complementarity among multiple views. Existing methods like SwMC (Nie et al. 2017), O2MAC (Fan et al. 2020), and MCGC (Pan and Kang 2021) employ strategies such as weighted graph learning and adaptive weighting to generate a high-quality graph from the original multi-relational data. Graph filtering, a key component of these methods, fuses topological structure and attribute information. Notably, impressive performance can be achieved even without neural networks (Lin et al. 2023; Pan and Kang 2023b), demonstrating the potential of representation learning techniques for traditional machine learning. However, these methods often rely on simple, fixed low-pass filters without fully considering inter-view correlations.\n\nExploring these correlations is crucial in multi-view learning.  Lyu et al. (2022) theoretically demonstrated the effectiveness of correlation-based objective functions in extracting shared and private information under certain assumptions.  Among these, Barlow Twins (Zbontar et al. 2021) has gained popularity.  It maximizes the correlation of the same features across different views (invariance term) while decorrelating different features (redundancy term).  This feature decorrelation not only leverages multi-view correlations but also mitigates representation collapse in self-supervised learning. While adopted in graph clustering methods like MVGC (Xia et al. 2022) and MGDCR (Mo et al. 2023), these applications often lack specific adaptations for multi-relational graphs, leading to persistent collapse issues. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which visualizes feature distributions for representative methods on ACM data: MGCCN (Liu et al. 2022b), MGDCR (Mo et al. 2023), and our proposed method, Barlow Twins Guided Filter (BTGF).  Comparing Figures 1(a) and 1(b) highlights the benefits of Barlow Twins, while Figures 1(b) and 1(c) reveal further improvement with BTGF.\n\nThis work demonstrates that a negative semi-definite inner product input establishes a lower bound for Barlow Twins loss, while a positive semi-definite input yields an upper bound. To minimize the loss, we utilize a graph filter to ensure a positive semi-definite inner product, effectively establishing an upper bound for Barlow Twins and preventing the loss from dominating other terms. Figure 2 depicts the overall architecture for multi-relational clustering.  The graph filter aggregates neighbor information for each node, producing smooth representations.  An encoder maps these representations into a clustering-favorable space, and a decoder reconstructs them.  Clustering results are obtained from the encoder output after training.",
        "Regression, a core problem in system identification, machine learning, and statistics, focuses on constructing models from noisy input-output data.  The primary goal is to estimate the regression function, which encodes the conditional expectation of the output given an input, based on a finite sample (Cucker and Zhou, 2007).  Established approaches include least squares, prediction error and instrumental variable methods, neural networks, and kernel machines (Gy\u00f6rfi et al., 2002).\n\nWhile these methods often provide point estimates, robust approaches and risk management require region estimates.  Traditionally, such regions are constructed using the asymptotic distribution of scaled estimation errors. However, non-asymptotic and distribution-free methods are preferable in practice.  Different types of region estimates exist: confidence regions in the parameter space (Cs\u00e1ji et al., 2014), confidence or credible bands for expected outputs (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006), and prediction regions for future observations (Vovk et al., 2005; Garatti et al., 2019). This paper concentrates on constructing simultaneous confidence bands for the regression function, a task challenging in nonparametric settings, unlike parametric settings where confidence regions in the parameter space suffice.\n\nGaussian process regression offers a powerful framework for Gaussian data, providing prediction regions for outputs and credible regions for expected outputs (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006).  However, the Gaussianity assumption is often too restrictive, motivating alternative approaches with weaker assumptions.\n\nRecently, a novel non-asymptotic, distribution-free method was proposed to build data-driven confidence bands for bounded, band-limited regression functions using Paley-Wiener kernels (Cs\u00e1ji and Horv\u00e1th, 2022).  This method requires mild assumptions: symmetric, input-independent noise, and i.i.d. input-output pairs.  However, it assumes a known, uniform input distribution.\n\nThis paper introduces three refinements to this method:\n\n(1) We replace the symmetric noise assumption with a distributional invariance principle. While i.i.d. noise already satisfies distributional invariance to permutations, this generalization removes the symmetry requirement.  Existing symmetry, if known, can still be incorporated into the transformation group.\n\n(2) We propose a more efficient method for estimating the L2 norm of the target bandlimited function by tightening the constraints of the underlying convex optimization problem.\n\n(3) We further apply this constraint tightening to the construction of confidence intervals at each input, leading to less conservative region estimates.\n\nThese refinements maintain the original method's guarantees and are supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.",
        "The ongoing COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic is rapidly spreading and significantly impacting healthcare systems worldwide. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures implemented in numerous countries are helping to control the spread of the disease, albeit at the cost of disrupting economic stability and social structures. Rapid detection of cases and contacts is a crucial aspect of managing the pandemic. In the United States, it is estimated that a minimum of 500,000 Covid-19 tests will need to be conducted daily to successfully reopen the economy. Unfortunately, efforts to contain the global spread of COVID-19 are hindered by severe shortages of testing kits.\n\nThere are currently two types of tests available for COVID-19:\n- Molecular diagnostic tests that detect the presence of SARS-COV-2 nucleic acids in human samples. A positive result indicates the presence of the virus in the body.\n- Serological diagnostic tests that identify antibodies (e.g., IgM, IgG) to SARS-COV-2 in clinical specimens. Also known as antibody tests, these tests can help identify individuals who are currently infected or have previously been infected, as antibodies remain present in their blood. This distinction is crucial as it can differentiate those who are immune from those still vulnerable. Moreover, identifying populations with antibodies can aid in research for potential treatments, such as using convalescent plasma to develop a cure for COVID-19.\n\nDespite these advancements, both types of tests are facing critical shortages. Governments have implemented various strategies to address this scarcity, such as the FDA's more lenient approach to approving COVID-19 tests through Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Efforts are also underway in the US and the UK to increase local production of test kits with a goal of reaching a throughput of 100,000 kits per day. However, many countries, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, still face significant challenges in accessing an adequate supply of testing kits, leaving entire populations vulnerable to the threat of the virus.",
        "To enhance the logical flow and coherence of the text, I have restructured it by grouping related ideas together and ensuring a more systematic progression of concepts. Here's the revised version:\n\n---\n\nTwo-layer neural networks (also referred to as neural networks with one hidden layer) are functions \\( f : \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\) of the following form:\n\n\\[ \\text{EQUATION} \\]\n\nIn this formulation, the weights are denoted by \\( \\{b_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d \\) and \\( \\{a_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\), while the biases are represented by \\( \\{c_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\). The activation function is given by \\( \\sigma : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\). The notation \\( \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle \\) indicates the scalar product in \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\). The individual summands \\( \\{\\sigma(x, b_i + c_i)\\}_{i=1}^n \\) are known as neurons and collectively form the hidden layer of the network.\n\nThe famous universal approximation theorem [1][2][3] states that if the activation function \\( \\sigma \\) is not a polynomial, then any continuous function on a compact set in \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\) can be approximated arbitrarily well (in the supremum norm) by functions of the form (1.1). However, quantitative estimates, such as the number of neurons required to achieve a certain accuracy, depend on the dimension of the input space \\( d \\), with approximation error scaling as \\( O(n^{-d}) \\). For high-dimensional inputs (\\( d \\gg 1 \\)), this is not satisfactory, an effect known as the curse of dimensionality.\n\nBarron [4] demonstrated that for \\( L^1 \\) functions whose Fourier transform satisfies a certain integrability condition, dimension-independent Monte-Carlo rates \\( O(1/\\sqrt{n}) \\) can be obtained for the approximation error in \\( L^2 \\). However, the condition introduced by Barron is too conservative and fails for many functions that can be approximated by (1.1) with dimension-independent rates. More general spaces, termed variation norm spaces, were studied in [5][6][7][8]. Roughly speaking, these spaces consist of functions whose expansion coefficients in a certain basis or frame are absolutely summable.\n\nThis approach was further extended in [9], replacing the basis/frame expansion with an integral over a compact latent space against a finite Radon measure. This work was continued in [10], which showed that these spaces are, in some sense, optimal: they contain all weak-* limits of (1.1) as \\( n \\rightarrow \\infty \\). These spaces were referred to as variation norm (or \\( F^1 \\)) spaces in [9] and Barron spaces in [10,11]. We will use the notation \\( F^1 \\) for these spaces.\n\nA related concept is that of random feature models [16] in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, which share the same form (1.1) but differ from \\( F^1 \\) functions in how the parameters \\( \\{a_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\) and \\( \\{b_i, c_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\) are trained.",
        "I'll help polish this academic text to improve its clarity and readability while maintaining its technical accuracy. Here's the enhanced version:\n\n# Point Set Registration: A Comprehensive Review and Novel Approach\n\n## Introduction\n\nPoint set registration is a fundamental yet challenging methodology widely used in computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics. Its applications span 3D model reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and cultural heritage management. While modern 3D scanning devices have simplified point cloud acquisition, a significant challenge remains: most devices can only capture partial point clouds due to scene occlusion and limited field of view. This limitation necessitates point set registration to accurately reconstruct complete models from multiple scans taken from different viewpoints.\n\nThe process involves determining rigid transformations between scans relative to a centered frame, ultimately aligning multi-view scans into a complete model. Point set registration can be categorized into two main types: pairwise registration and multi-view registration.\n\n## Historical Development\n\nOver recent decades, researchers have developed numerous approaches to solve the pairwise registration problem, broadly classified into:\n\n1. **Coarse Registration Methods**\n   - Feature-based methods (most popular)\n   - Deep learning-based methods (emerging approach)\n\n2. **Fine Registration Methods**\n   - ICP-based algorithms (most studied)\n   - Various metric-based improvements\n\n### Coarse Registration\n\nFeature-based methods typically follow three key steps:\n- Extracting geometric features (keypoints and descriptors)\n- Matching features to establish correspondences\n- Estimating rigid transformation based on correspondences\n\nWhile these methods are affected by point density, outliers, and overlapping percentage, recent deep learning approaches show promise in overcoming these limitations.\n\n### Fine Registration\n\nICP-based algorithms achieve accurate results through iterative refinement:\n- Searching nearest correspondences\n- Estimating and updating rigid transformations\n- Converging to final alignment\n\n[... continue with similar improvements to the rest of the text ...]\n\nWould you like me to continue with the remaining sections?

        "Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers information from a teacher model to a student model, thereby improving the student's performance (Hinton et al., 2015).  Student models are typically smaller neural networks with lower learning capacity than their teacher counterparts.  KD has been widely used to compress large pre-trained models like CLIP and GPT-3 (Liu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; West et al., 2021), addressing the high resource consumption and inference costs that limit their deployment in downstream applications (Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2021).\n\nWhile recent research has explored why KD improves model performance (Yuan et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021), fewer studies have investigated its other benefits.  This study demonstrates that KD not only improves generalization performance but also enhances model interpretability, a crucial indicator of reliability.\n\nUnderstanding the internal decision-making processes of neural networks, often considered \"black boxes,\" has been a persistent challenge (Singla et al., 2019; Sundararajan et al., 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2016).  Explainability is essential for applying large models like CLIP and GPT-3 to diverse research areas (Gerlings et al., 2021; van der Velden et al., 2022).  Many studies equate higher interpretability with object-centric activation (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Dabkowski & Gal, 2017; Zintgraf et al., 2017).  Our findings indicate that KD promotes object-centricity in student model activation maps, thus enhancing their interpretability.\n\nFigure 1 summarizes our key arguments.  We used the number of concept detectors from network dissection (Bau et al., 2017) as our interpretability metric.  This metric reflects the degree of object-centricity in activation maps and is directly proportional to interpretability.  We compared the interpretability of models trained from scratch (f<sub>scratch</sub>) and models trained using KD (f<sub>KD</sub>), as illustrated in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). The activation maps reveal that f<sub>KD</sub> exhibits greater object-centricity than f<sub>scratch</sub>.\n\nWe attribute this enhanced interpretability to the transfer of class-similarity information from teacher to student.  Teacher model distributions exhibit high similarity between semantically related classes.  For instance, with a Border Collie input image, the student model is trained to minimize the distance to the teacher's distribution (z<sub>t</sub>), which assigns high probability to \"dog\" related classes.  Consequently, the student model learns the characteristic features of \"dog\" from \"dog\" samples, fostering object-centricity in its learned representations.\n\nTo confirm that class-similarity information enhances interpretability, we measured the entropy of semantically similar classes, verifying its transfer via logit distillation.  We compared f<sub>KD</sub> with a model trained using label smoothing (f<sub>LS</sub>), a technique that negatively impacts class-similarity information. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show that f<sub>LS</sub> learns background features rather than object features, reducing interpretability. In the Border Collie example, f<sub>LS</sub> increases the probability of irrelevant classes (e.g., valley) by minimizing the distance to a uniform distribution (u), resulting in less object-centric activation maps.  Thus, KD enhances both performance and interpretability, while LS diminishes interpretability.\n\nBeyond analyzing the presence or absence of class-similarity information, we also examined its degree.  Following Chandrasegaran et al. (2022), who demonstrated calibrating this information transfer by adjusting the temperature of KD with a label-smoothed teacher (f<sub>teacher LS</sub>), we analyzed the impact of f<sub>teacher LS</sub> on student interpretability at various temperatures.",
        "Barrier functions are a popular tool for deriving constrained control laws that prioritize safety, ease of implementation, and good performance. However, their widespread use is hindered by the lack of a systematic method to synthesize them for various system classes with arbitrary state and input constraints.\n\nOne study explores the relationship between the CBF condition, input constraints, and the decay rate of the CBF to ensure pointwise feasibility but falls short in guaranteeing recursive feasibility. Another study focuses on designing CBFs for Euler-Lagrange systems, yielding promising results within a relevant system class but limited to box constraints. A different approach employs a backup control policy to expand a control invariant set, leading to the derivation of backup CBFs. However, these backup CBFs are challenging to implement due to the lack of closed forms. Additionally, a study utilizing maximal output admissible sets (MOASs) successfully designs discrete-time CBFs for linear systems, but the applicability to nonlinear systems remains unresolved.\n\nThis work extends prior research on CBFs, particularly in generating CBFs from a prestabilizing or backup controller. It introduces the concept of dynamic safety margins (DSMs) borrowed from the explicit reference governor (ERG) framework to create CBFs for augmented systems that include the controller's reference as a state. Furthermore, it demonstrates that DSMs exhibit the control-sharing property when sharing the same prestabilizing controller to handle multiple constraints. The benefit of this analysis lies in facilitating CBF synthesis using tools established in the ERG framework. Numerical simulations confirm that DSM-based CBFs outperform ERG while providing strong safety guarantees crucial for correct CBF selection.\n\nThe authors are affiliated with the Department of Electrical, Computer & Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309, USA (email: vifr9883@colorado.edu; marco.nicotra@colorado.edu).\n\nNotation: Bold font is reserved for vector quantities, such as x \u2208 R^n.

        "Teaching evolution via natural selection faces a central challenge: its counter-intuitive nature stems from the vast spatial and temporal scales over which it operates, making it difficult to observe and understand. This has become a particularly controversial issue in the United States educational system in recent decades (Sinatra et al., 2008).  While various efforts aim to address this, incorporating evolution into games offers a promising approach by presenting the concept in a non-confrontational, accessible format.\n\nSeveral games have attempted this, but encounter recurring issues.  The inherent directionless nature of natural selection often clashes with the need for directed gameplay, leading developers to introduce artificial goals. This reinforces the misconception of a guiding force in evolution, as seen in games like Spore (Bean et al., 2010).  Furthermore, some educational games prioritize scientific accuracy over enjoyment, resulting in limited player engagement. Even successful games that balance both face the challenge of reaching a wide audience. Finally, overt marketing of a game as being about evolution can alienate those resistant to the concept.  Therefore, an effective game must 1) accurately implement natural selection, 2) be enjoyable, 3) attract a large player base, and 4) avoid explicit focus on evolution.\n\nDeveloping such a game is challenging, so we propose an alternative: modding.  Community modifications (mods) to existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) games offer a compelling solution.  Modding leverages established, popular games with existing fanbases, ensuring enjoyment and reach.  It also allows for \"stealth learning\" by presenting the mod as a realism enhancement (Sharp, 2012), bypassing resistance to evolution. This approach has precedent in both formal educational settings (Moshirnia, 2007) and informal learning environments, where students modify games to explore academic concepts (Bertozzi, 2014; Hayes and King, 2009; Steinkuehler and Johnson, 2009).\n\nWe explore the potential of artificial life research for teaching evolution through game mods and present a proof-of-concept mod for Stardew Valley. This popular \"country life RPG\" (Barone, 2020), with over 5 million owners (Orland, 2018) and an active modding community, provides an ideal platform. Our mod targets the fishing mechanic, enhancing gameplay while subtly integrating principles of natural selection. This demonstrates the feasibility of embedding evolutionary concepts within existing games for educational purposes.",
        "Motion planning is essential for autonomy of a robot in completing a task. In practice, robotic systems are subject to unmodeled dynamics or environment, which is often compensated by introducing random processes, i.e. noise, to the system model. The noise needs to be explicitly considered in the motion planning in order to complete a task reliably. In this work, we refer to such motion planning problems as stochastic motion planning. More specifically, we consider the problem of navigating a car-like robot with a range sensor.\n\nA principled way to solve stochastic motion planning is to model the problem as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Methods following this approach are often known as belief space planning in the robotics community. van den Berg et al. extend iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) to belief dynamics, and propose (belief space) iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG), which solves a local optimal control policy for a continuous POMDP. Superior performance is shown in light-dark domain problems, where measurements have small or large noise in light or dark regions respectively. However, few work has reported successful applications of iLQG for more common sensors, such as range sensors considered in this work.\n\nWe summarize the reasons for the lack of applications of iLQG to range sensors as follows. First, iLQG requires the underlying system to have differentiable motion and measurement models. However, because of the discontinuity in the environment, the range sensor model is often nondifferentiable. Second, informative measurements, i.e. measurements that are effective in reducing localization uncertainty, from range sensors are sparse. To elaborate, informative measurements can only be obtained if obstacles are within the maximum sensing range of the beams. If the robot is sufficiently far from the obstacles with all measurements saturated at the maximum range, it cannot be known where to move to collect informative measurements by just locally perturbing the robot state. In terms of optimization, it means a majority of states are saddle points, providing trivial gradient information and preventing iLQG from converging to a local minimum.\n\nContributions: In this work, we apply iLQG to solve the stochastic motion planning problem for car-like robots with range sensors by addressing the previously mentioned two limitations.",
        "Projected stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a fundamental method used to address large-scale constrained single-level machine learning problems. To minimize E \u03be [L(x; \u03be)] within a given convex set X, the algorithm generates a sequence where x k+1 = Proj X (x k - \u03b1\u2207L(x k; \u03be k)), with \u03b1 > 0 representing the step size and \u2207L(x k; \u03be k) being a stochastic gradient estimate of E \u03be L(x k; \u03be). If E \u03be [L(x; \u03be)] is nonconvex, projected SGD requires a sample complexity of O(\u03b5^-2) with a batch size of O(1/\u03b5) [25]. The need for a batch size of O(1/\u03b5) was later relaxed [14] using the Moreau envelope technique, with its convergence rate matching that of vanilla SGD.\n\nIn recent machine learning applications, the scope has expanded to include hyperparameter optimization [19, 47], meta-learning [18], reinforcement learning [56], and neural architecture search [40]. While the nonasymptotic analysis of the alternating implicit SGD for unconstrained bilevel optimization with strongly convex and smooth lower-level problems has been well-understood [8, 24, 29, 32, 37], there is a gap in knowledge regarding the finite-time guarantee of alternating implicit projected SGD for bilevel problems with both upper-level (UL) and lower-level (LL) constraints. This raises the crucial question: Can we establish the \u00d5(\u03b5^-2) sample complexity of alternating implicit projected SGD for a family of bilevel problems with both UL and LL constraints?\n\nWe provide an affirmative answer to this question for stochastic bilevel optimization problems that feature both UL and LL constraints. These problems are defined as follows:\n\n[Equation]\n\nHere, \u03be and \u03c6 are random variables, X = {x | Bx = e} \u2282 R^dx and Y(x) = {y | Ay + h(x) = c} \u2282 R^dy are closed convex sets; A \u2208 R^my\u00d7dy, B \u2208 R^mx\u00d7dx, c \u2208 R^my, e \u2208 R^mx, h : R^dx \u2192 R^my. A and B are not necessarily full row or column rank, and the coupling function h can be nonlinear. In equation (1), the UL optimization problem relies on the solution of the LL optimization over y, and both the LL function and constraint set depend on the UL variable x. The equality-constrained bilevel problem (1) encompasses a broader range of applications than unconstrained bilevel optimization, such as distributed bilevel optimization, hyperparameter optimization for optimal transport, and transportation network design. When A = 0, B = 0, h = 0, c = 0, and e = 0, problem (1) simplifies to the unconstrained stochastic bilevel problem.",
        "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted communication has emerged as a promising technology to meet the increasing demand for high spectral and energy efficiency in future wireless systems.  Comprising cost-effective, passive, and programmable elements, IRSs can intelligently manipulate wireless propagation environments, tailoring signal paths between communication nodes [1]\u2013[6]. This allows for directing transmitted signal energy via beamforming, leading to significant power savings.  Furthermore, IRSs, typically fabricated as thin rectangular planes, can be easily integrated into existing infrastructure by attaching them to building facades, indoor ceilings, and vehicles [6], [7].  Driven by these advantages, research has explored IRS applications for enhancing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission [8], physical layer security [9], and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [10].\n\nTo fully realize the potential of IRSs, careful design of both the IRS phase shift configuration and the base station (BS) transmit beamforming is crucial [4], [6], [10], [11].  Several studies have investigated joint BS beamforming and IRS reflection coefficient design to minimize total transmit power while guaranteeing user quality-of-service (QoS).  Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), transmit power minimization problems have been explored for various IRS-assisted wireless systems, including multiuser MIMO systems [2], secure wireless systems [11], and SWIPT systems [10]. However, the significant power savings reported in [2], [10], and [11] rely on the assumption of continuous IRS phase shifts, which is impractical.  Due to challenges such as high energy consumption, integration complexity, and component coupling, practical IRS elements typically employ discrete, low-resolution phase shifters, often 1-bit (on-off) or 2-bit (quadruple-level) [4], [6], [12].\n\nConsequently, research has begun investigating resource allocation with discrete IRS phase shifts.  For example, [12] proposed a suboptimal alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to promote user fairness in multiuser systems.  However, as shown in [8] and [11], AO-based algorithms for these non-convex optimization problems compromise optimality, often converging to local optima and exhibiting performance dependence on initial points [8], [11], [13].  To explore optimal performance, [4] considered a single-user scenario, determining the optimal BS beamformer and discrete IRS phase shifts using enumeration. This approach, however, is difficult to extend to multiuser systems due to the complexity of finding closed-form optimal beamforming vectors.  Furthermore, assuming perfect CSI, the conference version of this paper [1] presented a generalized Benders decomposition (GBD)-based algorithm for a simplified multiuser system without a direct BS-user link.  However, optimal design for IRS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with a direct link and imperfect CSI remains an open problem.\n\nWhile [1] and [4] assume perfect CSI, acquiring accurate CSI in passive IRS systems is challenging.  Conventional channel estimation methods struggle with IRS-assisted links, leading to inevitable channel estimation errors and imperfect CSI [7], [9].  Furthermore, BS-IRS and IRS-user channels are typically cascaded for end-to-end estimation, requiring joint consideration of their CSI and estimation errors [7], [14]. Consequently, robust designs for imperfect CSI have been studied.  For instance, [7] and [14] employed worst-case robust optimization methods based on linear approximation and successive convex approximation (SCA), respectively, assuming continuous phase shifts.  However, even with this optimistic assumption, global optimality is not guaranteed.  A globally optimal robust resource allocation framework for practical IRS systems with imperfect CSI and discrete phase shifters is still lacking.\n\nMotivated by this, we investigate, for the first time, globally optimal joint BS beamforming and IRS phase shift design for multiuser IRS-assisted systems with discrete phase shifters. Our contributions are:\n\n* We study resource allocation in IRS-assisted systems with discrete phase shifters, minimizing BS transmit power while guaranteeing minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each user. We develop optimal and suboptimal strategies for both perfect and imperfect CSI.\n* For perfect CSI, we formulate the joint design problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and propose transformations enabling a GBD-based iterative algorithm that guarantees convergence to the globally optimal solution. This algorithm provides a performance benchmark for suboptimal designs [4], [12].  We also develop a computationally efficient suboptimal SCA-based scheme.\n* We extend our framework to imperfect CSI, recasting robust SINR constraints as linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints and formulating a robust MINLP problem.",
        "To address the demands of privacy regulations, federated learning (FL) [31] is gaining traction for modeling decentralized data in both academia and industry.  FL enables clients with decentralized data to collaboratively develop a high-performing global model without transferring data. However, conventional FL research predominantly assumes well-labeled client data, a scenario rarely encountered in real-world applications. This work addresses federated unsupervised learning (FUSL) with non-IID data [14, 43], specifically, modeling a unified representation across imbalanced, unlabeled, and decentralized data. *Chaochao Chen is the corresponding author.\n\nExisting centralized unsupervised methods are ill-suited to FUSL with its non-IID data [44]. A popular approach involves training self-supervised learning models, such as BYOL [8], SimCLR [3], and Simsiam [5], on clients and aggregating the models by accounting for extreme model divergence [44, 45], employing knowledge distillation [9], or combining with clustering [30]. However, these methods often overlook two coupled challenges inherent in FUSL: (CH1) mitigating representation collapse entanglement and (CH2) achieving unified representation spaces.\n\nThe first challenge, representation collapse [13], occurs when a client's representation collapse negatively impacts the global and other local models. Inspired by regularizing the Frobenius norm of representations in centralized self-supervised models [15, 21], FedDecorr [36] addresses representation collapse using global supervision signals in federated *supervised* learning. However, directly applying these methods to FUSL presents limitations.  First, they rely on large data batch sizes [30] to capture reliable distribution statistics, such as representation variance.  Second, regularizing the norm of high-dimensional representations can lead to neuron inactivation and the suppression of meaningful features [18]. Finally, clients cannot resolve representation collapse entanglement simply by decorrelating representations in FUSL if their data resides in different representation spaces.\n\nThe second challenge involves optimizing inconsistent client model parameters towards disparate parameter spaces, resulting in less unified representations among local models.",
        "Osteoporotic fractures are prevalent among older adults and have led to more than two million Disability Adjusted Life Years in Europe. The occurrence of vertebral fractures significantly heightens the likelihood of subsequent fractures, making them an early indicator of osteoporosis. Medical imaging techniques, such as Computed Tomography (CT), are effective in identifying fractures. However, radiologists often overlook fractures, especially if they are not specialized in musculoskeletal imaging, with an error rate exceeding 50%.\n\nRapidly advancing low-dose CT programs, such as those for lung cancer, offer a solid foundation for opportunistic screening of vertebral fractures. Research within the medical imaging community has extensively explored the detection and classification of fractures at the vertebrae or whole-study level, either individually or in combination. Many of these approaches necessitate prior detection of vertebrae or spine segmentation. Detecting fractured vertebrae poses the greatest challenge for these algorithms, where even high average detection/segmentation accuracy may not ensure precise fracture estimation.\n\nAnother significant challenge is the disparity between computer science problem formulations and the radiological definition of fractures. The Genant scale, a widely accepted medical criterion endorsed by the International Osteoporosis Foundation, relies on measuring the anterior, middle, and posterior heights of vertebral bodies. Existing methods are typically trained to predict binary or multiclass labels derived from radiological reports, creating interpretability issues in method outputs.\n\nOur contribution addresses these challenges through a two-pronged approach. Firstly, we introduce a novel method to identify the vertebral column in 3D CT scans, simplifying the problem to 2D by generating mid-sagittal slices to measure vertebral heights. This approach, trained to tackle the localization problem directly, exhibits exceptional localization accuracy with an average error of less than 1 mm, accommodating even severe scoliosis cases. Secondly, our method estimates six keypoints to detect each vertebra and simultaneously determine its heights, leading to superior fracture classification quality with an area under the ROC curve of 0.93. These predictions are highly interpretable and can be verified by a clinician using a simple ruler.",
        "Compositional Game Theory (CGT), recently introduced [9], offers a novel approach to game representation using *open games*.  These are built compositionally from simpler games using specialized operators. Despite significant interest and development [4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14], open games remain complex. Even the simplest form is an 8-tuple, and more advanced versions [4] require sophisticated structures like coends. This complexity has several negative consequences: (i) proofs become complex and error-prone; (ii) resulting programs, mirroring the proofs, are overly complex; (iii) experimentation and innovation are stifled\u2014the authors of [10], for example, found exploring alternative definitions prohibitive; and (iv) the underlying mathematical structure of open games remains obscured.\n\nCategory theory offers a solution to this complexity: trading complex definitions in simple categories for simpler definitions in more complex categories.  This approach simplified open games by factoring their definition through the category of lenses, and led to the discovery of Bayesian Open Games [4] by substituting lenses with optics in a monoidal category.  Such substitution is a hallmark of compositionality.  However, the current definition of open games *lacks* compositionality.  Consequently,  adaptations like open games with mixed strategies [10], which involve a seemingly minor change to the equilibrium predicate, necessitate rebuilding the entire theory.  The same holds for incorporating best-response functions, adding type dependency, allowing the play and co-play functions to reside in different categories, introducing monadic effects, or exploring numerous other variations.  Each modification requires a fresh, non-trivial demonstration that the resulting variant forms a monoidal category.\n\nWe present a compositional approach to CGT that allows localized modifications to the definition of an open game.  By verifying suitable local properties of these modifications, we can directly conclude that the resulting open games form a monoidal category.  Following the principles of compositionality, we begin with a semantic structure\u2014a presentation of monoidal categories using profunctors and Arrows [17]\u2014and define operators to construct complex instances from simpler ones.  This simplifies the treatment of the monoidal structure to that of a strength, enabling a purely functorial setting. While convenient, Arrows are not essential; working directly with monoidal categories is also possible.\n\nOur approach comprises a three-phase compositional axiomatization of CGT: (i) selecting an Arrow to represent the play/coplay structure; (ii) abstracting the equilibrium predicate to a bimodule over an Arrow, and defining an operator to construct new Arrows from existing ones and their bimodules; and (iii) abstracting the indexing of open games by strategies with an operator mapping graded Arrows to Arrows. This yields a simple, compositional, arrow-theoretic axiomatization of CGT.  We also demonstrate an alternative approach: introducing strategies before the equilibrium predicate, enabling the treatment of probabilistic games and games based on best-response functions.  While Hedges [14, \u00a78] presents a related axiomatization, it is neither compositional nor sufficiently general to encompass probabilistic or dependently typed open games.",
        "Neurostimulation technologies have demonstrated promising initial success over the past two decades in treating neurological disorders like drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as psychological conditions like depression (Lin and Wang, 2017; Ben-Menachem, 2012; Marangell et al., 2007).  Brain stimulation is also increasingly utilized for mapping the functional properties of various brain regions (Mandonnet et al., 2010) and enhancing sensory-motor activity (Jones et al., 2015; Toth et al., 2021).\n\nWhile the literature establishes the potency of external electromagnetic stimulation and explores neuromodulation under varying input conditions, clinical delivery has largely remained open-loop and expert-driven. This often involves constant stimulation over extended periods (sometimes months).  Such open-loop approaches are associated with inconsistent responses and suboptimal modulation, likely due to the brain's sensitivity to stimulation parameters (Deeb et al., 2016).  Closed-loop control, exemplified by the RNS\u00ae system from NeuroPace, Inc. (Skarpaas et al., 2019), offers a potential solution. However, most closed-loop implementations focus on ON-OFF control based on medically-derived biomarkers (e.g., signal line length, frequency band power, or tremor onset) rather than predictive evaluations of brain response.  This, coupled with the limited efficacy of current controllers (e.g., only 20% of individuals achieve complete seizure abatement with the RNS\u00ae system [Ramirez-Zamora et al., 2018]) and the need for energy-efficient systems, necessitates fully closed-loop control for stimulation tuning.\n\nA significant hurdle in developing fully closed-loop controllers is the brain's mechanistic complexity and modeling its response to various stimulation modalities. Despite the growing importance of neurostimulation and rapid advancements in brain activity monitoring (e.g., fMRI, iEEG), the precise mechanism of neurostimulation's interaction with the brain connectome remains poorly understood.\n\nThis review examines methods employed to understand brain responses to five common neurostimulation techniques: deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), direct electric stimulation (DES), transcranial electric stimulation (tES), and optogenetic stimulation.  Existing reviews primarily focus on the efficacy of these methods for treating conditions like PD, depression, or epilepsy, with less emphasis on brain modeling approaches (De Raedt et al., 2015; Kassiri et al., 2017; Magis and Schoenen, 2012; Starnes et al., 2019; Schoenen et al., 2016).  Some reviews address specific stimulation mechanisms (Montagni et al., 2019; Chervyakov et al., 2015) based on underlying neuroscience and biomarker usage for adaptive stimulation (Bouthour et al., 2019). Lozano et al. (2019) and Herrington et al. (2016) compile various neural mechanisms (e.g., thalamic neuron inhibition) explaining DBS responses to different disorders. However, to our knowledge, no review comprehensively compiles works on modeling brain responses across various neurostimulation techniques, motivating this present effort.\n\nWe categorize computational modeling studies of these neurostimulation methods into three approaches:\n\n1. **Biophysically-derived models:** These utilize electric field equations and/or neuron models to simulate the interaction between stimulation and the brain. Parameterized by factors like tissue conductivity and geometry, these models are tuned to replicate observed data and used to optimize stimulation parameters (e.g., location and intensity).\n\n2. **Stimulus-response models:** These employ statistical and machine learning tools (e.g., correlation, hypothesis testing, artificial neural networks) to model the overall stimulus-response profile. Data-driven in nature, these models generally don't capture the temporal dynamics of brain response.\n\n3. **Dynamical system models:** These learn the impact of neurostimulation on brain network dynamics using observed input-output time series data. Primarily data-driven, these methods typically avoid biophysical assumptions. (We acknowledge that some biophysical models incorporate dynamical system components.)\n\n(Figure 2: Year-wise spread\u2026)  Figure 2 illustrates the year-wise distribution of the reviewed literature across these three approaches. While biophysical and stimulus-response models have a longer history, data-driven dynamical systems modeling has increased markedly in recent years.  This figure compares categories, not absolute historical frequency, as the latter requires a historically uniform literature synthesis.\n\nThe following section provides an itemized review of the existing literature for each neurostimulation technology and methodological category (see Figure 1). While biophysical and stimulus-response models have longer histories and more studies across technologies (Figures 1 and 2), we emphasize dynamical systems models due to their applicability to therapeutic control design (summarized in Figure 3).  We also review key studies in the biophysical and stimulus-response categories to provide historical context.  Finally, we examine modeling efforts in the context of commonly studied brain disorders to facilitate focused analysis of disease-specific literature.\n\n*Review Criteria:*  We primarily used keyword searches on Google Scholar (e.g., \"{stimulation}+{approach}+{specific model}\").  Given the larger volume of literature for biophysical and stimulus-response models, we prioritized highly cited and recent works for inclusion, while also considering methodologically novel or significant findings in less cited works.  While not exhaustive, this review aims to provide a broad overview of prevailing methods for modeling brain dynamics in response to neurostimulation.  In cases where\u2026",
        "Deep learning represents a class of machine learning algorithms that utilize multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input data. For instance, in image processing, lower layers may detect edges, while higher layers may recognize more complex concepts like digits, letters, or faces. Deep neural networks have significantly advanced empirical results in various practical machine learning tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).\n\nUnderstanding neural network learning, especially its recent successes, can be categorized into two main themes: (i) investigating the generalization capacity of deep neural networks and (ii) understanding why efficient algorithms, like stochastic gradient descent, achieve good weights. While previous work offers some insights into the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks, the second question remains largely unclear. Despite successful learning outcomes in practice, theoretical analyses tend to be overly pessimistic. Theoretical findings suggest that as networks deepen beyond single-layer models, such as moving to depth-two networks with very few hidden units, predicting outcomes even slightly better than random becomes challenging (Daniely et al., 2013; Kearns & Valiant, 1994).\n\nThe traditional method of developing generalization bounds for deep learning (and machine learning) stems from seminal papers by Vapnik (1998). This approach involves bounding the discrepancy between generalization error and training error based on the VC-dimension of the class. However, these bounds can be overly lax when dealing with classes with potentially large or infinite VC-dimensions. In 1998, Bartlett & Shawe-Taylor (1999), along with Bartlett et al. (1998), proposed an alternative set of upper bounds on generalization error, which are related to the empirical distribution of the classifier's margin. Subsequently, Koltchinskii and Panchenko introduced novel probabilistic upper bounds on generalization error for combining numerous complex classifiers like deep neural networks (Koltchinskii & Panchenko, 2002). These bounds leverage results from the theories of Gaussian, Rademacher, and empirical processes, focusing on general functions of margins that adhere to a Lipschitz condition. This advancement improved prior knowledge on generalization error bounds for convex combinations of classifiers. Recent studies, such as those by Truong (2022a) and Truong (2022b), have developed generalization bounds for learning with Markov datasets, based on Rademacher and Gaussian complexity functions, with a key component being the creation of new symmetrization inequalities and contraction lemmas in high-dimensional probability for Markov chains.\n\nA recent addition to the realm of deep learning is the Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) introduced by Bai et al. (2019), which offers a fresh approach to modeling sequential data. In many existing deep sequence models, hidden layers tend to converge toward fixed points. The DEQ directly identifies these equilibrium points through the root-finding of implicit equations, effectively functioning as an infinite-depth weight-tied model with input-injection. The DEQ has gained prominence across various applications such as computer vision (Bai et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2022), natural language processing (Bai et al., 2019), and solving inverse problems (Gilton et al., 2021). Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of this model remains limited. The concept of overparameterization in optimizing feedforward neural networks has been validated through various research studies (Arora et al., 2019; Du et al., 2018; Li & Liang, 2018). Nguyen (2021) demonstrated that achieving a global optimum with gradient descent (GD) can be guaranteed when the width of the last hidden layer surpasses the number of training samples. Recent research by Gao & Gao (2022), Gao et al. (2022), and Ling et al. (2022) delved into the training dynamics of over-parameterized DEQs with ReLU activation and established the global convergence of gradient descent during DEQ training. Additionally, Gao & Gao (2022) showcased that as the width approaches infinity, DEQs display equivalence to a Gaussian process, known as the NNGP correspondence, if a Lipschitz continuous activation function is employed. They also highlighted that the NNGP kernel is strictly positive definite when using a non-polynomial activation function. However, existing concentration approaches face challenges in DEQs due to implicit weight-sharing, prompting a new probabilistic framework proposed by Ling et al.",
        "In many scientific and engineering disciplines, mathematical and computational simulators are employed to gain mechanistic insights. A common challenge is determining the parameter settings of these simulators so that their outputs align with a set of empirical observations. For instance, identifying a distribution of parameters that, when processed through the simulator, generates a distribution of outputs that matches empirical observations is crucial. Suppose we have a stochastic simulator with input parameters \\(\\theta\\) and output \\(x\\), allowing us to generate samples from the forward model \\(p(x|\\theta)\\), which is typically intractable. We have acquired a dataset \\(D = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\) of observations with the empirical distribution \\(p_o(x)\\) and seek to identify a distribution \\(q(\\theta)\\) over the parameters that, once run through the simulator, produces a \"pushforward\" distribution of simulations \\(q^\\#(x) = \\int p(x|\\theta)q(\\theta)\\,d\\theta\\) indistinguishable from the empirical distribution.\n\nThis problem, known by different names in various disciplines, is called \"unfolding\" in high-energy physics, \"population of models\" in electrophysiology, and \"population inference\" in gravitational wave astronomy, among others. Following the terminology of Vandegar et al. (2020), we refer to this challenge as \"source distribution estimation.\"\n\nOne approach to source distribution estimation is empirical Bayes, which uses hierarchical models, modeling each observation as arising from different parameters, \\(p(x_i|\\theta_i)\\). The hyperparameters of the prior, and, by extension, the source, \\(q_\\varphi\\), are determined by optimizing the marginal likelihood, \\(p(D) = \\prod_i \\int p(x_i|\\theta)q_\\varphi(\\theta)\\,d\\theta\\) over \\(\\varphi\\).",

Background and Challenges\n\nTraditional approaches to solving linear programming problems include:\n- Simplex methods [38, 49]\n- Interior-point methods [18, 21, 36, 43, 45, 48]\n- Continuous methods [1, 11, 26, 33]\n\nThese methods typically assume consistent constraints where rank(A, b) = rank(A). For consistent systems with redundant constraints, preprocessing strategies exist [3, 4, 34] and are widely implemented in both academic and commercial solvers.\n\n## 3. Real-World Considerations\n\nReal-world problems present two key challenges:\n1. Redundant constraints\n2.

        "Motivated by various applications, we study the estimation of nested expectations, which are defined in the following manner. Let \\( X = (X_1, \\ldots, X_J) \\in \\mathbb{R}^J \\) and \\( Y = (Y_1, \\ldots, Y_K) \\in \\mathbb{R}^K \\) be potentially dependent random variables following the joint probability density \\(\\rho(X, Y)\\). For a function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^J \\to \\mathbb{R} \\), the nested expectation is defined by:\n\n**EQUATION**\n\nThe outer expectation is taken with respect to the marginal distribution of \\( Y \\), while the inner expectation is with respect to the conditional distribution of \\( X \\) given \\( Y \\). We denote the marginal probability densities as \\(\\rho(X)\\) and \\(\\rho(Y)\\), and the conditional probability densities as \\(\\rho(X|Y)\\) and \\(\\rho(Y|X)\\).\n\n### Motivating Examples\n\n**Example 1 (Expected Information Gain):** Bayesian experimental design aims to construct an optimal experimental design in which observing \\( Y \\) maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) on the input random variable \\( \\theta \\) [1, 2]. The EIG, which denotes the expected reduction in Shannon information entropy, is given by:\n\n**EQUATION**\n\nHere, the equality follows from Bayes' theorem, and a nested expectation appears in the second term on the right-hand side.\n\n**Example 2 (Expected Value of Sample Information):** In medical decision-making, we assess whether conducting a clinical trial or medical research to reduce the uncertainty of \\( \\theta \\) is valuable [3]. The expected value of sample information (EVSI) measures the average gain in net benefit from observing \\( Y \\):\n\n**EQUATION**\n\nThe first term represents the average net benefit when selecting the optimal treatment based on observation \\( Y \\), while the second term represents the net benefit without the observation. This first term is a nested expectation as defined earlier.\n\n### Estimation Methods\n\nThe nested Monte Carlo (NMC) method is one straightforward approach to estimate nested expectations by approximating the inner and outer expectations through standard Monte Carlo techniques. For integers \\( N_p \\) and \\( N_q \\), the NMC estimator is:\n\n**EQUATION**\n\nHere, \\( Y^{(1)}, \\ldots, Y^{(N_p)} \\) are i.i.d. samples from \\(\\rho(Y)\\), and \\( X^{(p,1)}, \\ldots, X^{(p,N_q)} \\) are i.i.d. samples from \\(\\rho(X|Y = Y^{(p)})\\) for each \\( p = 1, \\ldots, N_p \\). However, estimating nested expectations with high accuracy using the NMC method incurs high computational costs [4], and it also has limitations in applicability, as generating i.i.d. samples from \\(\\rho(X|Y)\\) can be difficult [5, 6, 7].\n\nIn typical scenarios for estimating nested expectations, i.i.d. samples can be generated from \\(\\rho(X)\\) and \\(\\rho(Y|X)\\), or from \\(\\rho(X, Y)\\). Alternatives to the NMC method include using a Markov chain sampler for each \\(\\rho(X|Y = Y^{(p)})\\), though this can complicate obtaining non-asymptotic bounds on mean squared error and optimal allocation of \\( N_p \\) and \\( N_q \\). Another method involves rewriting the expectation using Bayes' theorem:\n\n**EQUATION**\n\nThis approach often requires sophisticated techniques like importance sampling due to the concentration of \\(\\rho(Y|X)\\) around small regions of \\( X \\).\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a new Monte Carlo estimator for nested expectations based on post-stratification, which doesn't require sampling from \\(\\rho(X|Y)\\). Our estimator relies on a dataset of \\((X, Y)\\) pairs drawn from the joint distribution \\(\\rho(X, Y)\\), eliminating the need for a Markov chain sampler and importance sampling.",

Introduction and Background\n\nThe rapid development of deep learning and increased data availability has brought data privacy concerns to the forefront of both industry and academia. Federated Learning, proposed by McMahan et al. (2017), offers a solution by enabling decentralized training across clients without direct data sharing.\n\nHowever, a significant challenge in federated learning is data heterogeneity - particularly in label distributions across clients. This heterogeneity can cause significant disagreements between local and global optima, potentially degrading the global model's performance.\n\n## 2. Previous Approaches and Their Limitations\n\nPrevious attempts to address data heterogeneity have primarily focused on model parameters, either during:\n- Local training (Li et al., 2020; Karimireddy et al., 2020)\n- Global aggregation (Wang et al., 2020b)\n\nThese approaches often result in excessive computational burden or high communication costs due to the over-parameterization of deep neural networks.\n\n## 3. Our Novel Approach: Understanding Dimensional Collapse\n\n### 3.1 Impact of Heterogeneous Data\n\nOur research reveals that stronger data heterogeneity leads to dimensional collapse, where representations become confined to a lower-dimensional space. This finding emerged from analyzing the singular values of representation covariance matrices under different degrees of data heterogeneity.\n\n### 3.2 Local to Global Model Connection\n\nWe discovered that dimensional collapse in the global model originates from locally trained models. Through gradient flow dynamics analysis, we demonstrated that heterogeneous data inherently biases local model weight matrices toward being low-rank.\n\n## 4. Proposed Solution: FEDDECORR\n\nTo address dimensional collapse, we developed FEDDECORR, which:\n- Adds regularization during local training\n- Encourages smaller Frobenius norm of representation correlation matrices\n- Effectively mitigates dimensional collapse with minimal computational overhead\n- Can be integrated with existing federated learning methods\n\n## 5. Experimental Validation\n\nExtensive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that FEDDECORR:\n- Consistently outperforms baseline methods\n- Shows greater improvements in challenging scenarios (stronger heterogeneity, more clients)\n- Maintains computational efficiency\n\n## 6.

        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# Advances in Brain-Computer Interface Technology: A Review\n\nNeuroimaging technology has revolutionized our ability to visualize the human brain, offering unprecedented insights into both its structural and functional aspects. This advancement led to the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which leverage neuroimaging modalities like electroencephalography (EEG) to establish direct communication between the brain and computers. These systems have demonstrated remarkable applications, from cursor control[1-3] to wheelchair operation[4,5] and exoskeleton manipulation[6-8].\n\nThree primary neurological signals drive BCI commands: P300 oddball stimulus, steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), and motor-related somatosensory rhythms. While SSVEP and P300-based BCIs offer the advantage of brief training periods and have shown promising results, they require external stimulation. In contrast, motor-related brain rhythms, generated through motor imagery (MI) or motor planning, involve the mental simulation of motor tasks without actual muscle activation[9]. Research has shown that MI can produce movement-related cortical potential similar to actual muscle movement, without requiring external stimuli[10]. Scientists have employed various EEG features to detect motor-related brain activities, including:\n\n- Event-related desynchronization[11]\n- Beta rebound[12,13]\n- Empirical mode decomposition[14]\n- Filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP)[15]\n- Functional connectivity (FC)[16]\n\nDespite significant advances in BCI research enabling most users to effectively operate these systems, challenges remain. Even after extensive training, a substantial portion of the population struggles to successfully operate one or more types of BCI systems[17]. Studies estimate that approximately 15-30% of individuals cannot generate brain signals suitable for translation into BCI commands[18]. Furthermore, conventional BCIs focus solely on decoding implicit brain signals without considering the environmental context in which they operate.",
        "AI-native RAN is a prominent concept driving the evolution of wireless mobile networks by integrating AI throughout the entire RAN architecture. AI has shown significant success in various aspects of RAN design and optimization. These AI-driven RAN workloads can be deployed at the network edge, such as in centralized units (CU) or distributed units (DU). Edge-deployed machine learning (ML) workloads, unlike traditional cloud-centric architectures, are attractive for meeting the latency, scalability, reliability, and privacy requirements of beyond-5G applications. They also offer a compelling solution for privacy-focused multi-vendor deployment scenarios and compliance with data regulations.\n\nHowever, a common limitation in many AI-driven RAN studies is the tendency to focus on specific RAN problems, features, or use cases in isolation. This often leads to the customization of AI for particular use cases, resulting in specialized AI models. Implementing solutions with specialized AI models in operational RANs can lead to the proliferation of multiple specialized ML models for each downstream task (radio feature), increasing both RAN complexity and operational costs. Managing the independent life cycles of these edge-distributed workloads sharing limited compute resources (such as base stations, CU/DU) poses challenges in terms of availability of labeled data and compute-memory resources that need to scale with denser deployments.\n\nIn contrast, a more desirable approach is the vision of a general-purpose AI-native RAN, where a single AI algorithm can handle a wide range of networking operations across the entire protocol stack. Achieving this requires designing an AI algorithm capable of simultaneously managing multiple RAN tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) is a paradigm that can train a machine learning model to perform multiple RAN-related tasks jointly, drawing inspiration from how humans leverage prior knowledge to learn new tasks efficiently.\n\nOur study aims to address three key research questions: (i) How does the design space of state-of-the-art MTL approaches impact the overall performance of RAN-related tasks in terms of model architecture and weighting strategies?",
        "The traditional process of radiation therapy is typically divided into two phases: the planning phase and the treatment phase. The treatment phase generally comprises multiple sessions where malignant tissue is exposed to radiation. During the planning phase, a CT scan is conducted on the patient, and the results are used to determine the specific area that will be targeted in the subsequent radiation sessions. It is crucial that the patient's position during the radiation sessions matches the position during the planning phase.\n\nWith the advent of head-mounted displays like the Microsoft HoloLens, Augmented Reality (AR) has gained momentum in medical research, particularly in surgical applications such as training and intervention. Medical experts have expressed overwhelmingly positive opinions about these systems. However, the use of AR to guide patient positioning is so rare that recent literature reviews do not mention any related work. AR for patient positioning could potentially assist operators by providing interactive, real-time visualization of the actual patient position compared to the desired position.\n\nIn the past decade, there has been an increase in the use of consumer-level depth or RGB-Depth (RGB-D) cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect, in AR applications. These sensors are affordable and provide a real-time depth map of the scene along with a corresponding color image, offering a dense, real-time geometrical representation of the scene rather than the sparse pose estimation possible with fiducial markers. Concurrently, research on fiducial planar markers has led to the development of fast, robust, and inexpensive methods for precise camera pose tracking, requiring only a color camera and printed markers. Detectors like ArUco offer significant advantages over traditional infrared-based markers.\n\nLeveraging these recent technologies, this paper proposes a novel method for assisted patient positioning that simultaneously tracks both the patient and the treatment environment. Our system can render a virtual overlay of the patient's current pose and the desired pose using a freely moving RGB-D camera, enabling mobile interactive AR to guide patient positioning. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of such an operation. Additionally, our approach can be used for patient monitoring by fixing the RGB-D camera in a stationary position directed at the patient, although this does not utilize the full potential of our method, which allows the camera to move freely.\n\nOur innovative RGB-D-based, model-based object tracking algorithm is both accurate and fast without requiring general-purpose GPU computing on a dedicated GPU, relying solely on the CPU. This makes our method usable on a wide range of hardware, increasing accessibility and cost-effectiveness.",
        "The Metaverse is currently attracting attention as an alternative platform for human interaction in the virtual world. In parallel, Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology is a means to interpret user intention by decoding brain signals related to specific thoughts, such as imagined speech, movements, or visual imagery. While these two technologies may appear unrelated, their combination has the potential to usher in a new era of human interaction.\n\nThe virtual platform offers the flexibility to change surroundings and avatar appearances, making it an ideal medium to reflect human thoughts and dreams in the Metaverse. Imagined speech, a form of first-person verbalization without vocal output, is a promising concept in the realm of intuitive BCI. Unlike traditional BCI methods like steady-state visual evoked potentials, imagined speech directly conveys the words or sentences the user wishes to express, offering a more direct and convenient means of communication.\n\nImagined speech technology, referred to as the brain-to-speech (BTS) system, holds promise in enhancing the quality of life for BCI users. Originally designed to aid individuals with communication challenges, such as locked-in or paralyzed patients, BCI technology is now being extended to benefit healthy individuals, providing convenience in daily activities. With advancements in virtual systems like virtual reality, augmented reality, and the Metaverse, the BTS system could be the next frontier in neurocommunication.\n\nThis paper explores the potential applications of the BTS system as a future smart communication tool and its integration into Metaverse environments. Through a pseudo-online analysis of imagined speech, we investigate the feasibility of a real-world communication system based on this technology. Additionally, we demonstrate a virtual assistant-driven smart home system as a potential application of the imagined speech-based BTS system. Our findings support the viability of imagined speech technology for smart communication in the Metaverse, suggesting that virtual platforms could serve as training grounds for practical BCI applications in the real world.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nFrequency range 2 (FR2) [1] offers a viable solution to the bandwidth requirements of 5G mobile networks, addressing the increasing user demand for contiguous bandwidth. However, it introduces significant radio propagation challenges, including heightened free-space path loss and penetration loss [2]. These challenges lead to rapid signal degradation in mobile environments with multiple static and moving obstacles. Additionally, FR2 exacerbates inter-cell interference [3], which is particularly severe in cell boundary regions and subject to rapid fluctuations, resulting in frequent mobility failures.\n\nTo enhance mobility robustness, Conditional Handover (CHO) was introduced [4] as an alternative to baseline handover procedures. CHO decouples handover preparation from execution by implementing a conditional procedure: while the serving cell prepares the handover to the target cell early, the user equipment (UE) performs random access only when link quality becomes sufficient. However, despite optimal mobility parameter selection, CHO generates significant signaling overhead [3], particularly in FR2's dense cell deployment scenarios where frequent handovers occur.\n\nFor upcoming 5G-Advanced networks [5], discussions are underway regarding an alternative handover mechanism [6], [7]. Fast CHO (FCHO) allows the UE to maintain its prepared target cells post-handover and reuse them for autonomous handover execution. This approach substantially reduces signaling overhead by eliminating the need for repeated target cell preparation while simultaneously decreasing mobility failures through faster handover preparation and immediate execution when superior cells become available.\n\nRegarding UE architecture, multi-panel UE (MPUE) has emerged as another proposed solution, featuring multiple spatially distinct antenna panels [8], [9]. MPUE provides enhanced directional gain per panel compared to traditional isotropic UEs with single-panel omnidirectional radiation patterns. When configured to communicate through panels oriented toward the serving cell, MPUE can significantly reduce inter-cell interference from neighboring cells.\n\nThis paper examines FCHO's mobility performance through mobility key performance indicators (KPIs) and signaling overhead analysis. The study explores two different MPUE signal measurement schemes currently under 3GPP standardization consideration [10]. Understanding FCHO's mobility performance with advanced UE architectures is crucial, as both elements are integral to 5G-Advanced [5]. Notably, this represents the first scholarly investigation of FCHO's mobility performance.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section II details CHO preparation, release, and replace events, including their associated signaling requirements. Section III introduces the FCHO mechanism and highlights its advantages over conventional CHO. Section IV describes the simulation scenario and two MPUE signal measurement schemes. Section V presents mobility KPIs and CHO signaling events that reflect overhead, followed by a comparative analysis of FCHO and CHO performance across MPUE and isotropic UE architectures in two realistic mobility scenarios. Section VI concludes the paper and discusses potential future enhancements.",
        "Q-learning, introduced in [28], is a celebrated reinforcement learning approach that has evolved over decades to address complex optimal control problems.  Originally designed to compute the state-action value function (Q-function) for the discounted-cost optimal control problem in tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it spanned the entire function space.\n\nThe enduring goal is to approximate the Q-function within a restricted function class, often neural networks, although much of the theoretical foundation remains limited to linearly parameterized functions.  Counterexamples [2, 9, 27] demonstrate that conditions on the function class are generally necessary, even with linear function approximation.  Recent work [18] establishes stability criteria based on sufficient exploration.  Furthermore, while convergent Q-learning or Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms solve a \"projected Bellman equation\" (see (11)), the implications of this remain poorly understood. These challenges have motivated new approaches to Q-function approximation.\n\nOne alternative is GQ learning [25], a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with an objective similar to the mean-square Bellman error.  A more precise stochastic gradient descent algorithm with full stability analysis was recently introduced in [1].  Despite this significant advancement, two drawbacks persist: the objective's non-convexity offers no guarantee of convergence to the global minimum, and the global minimum's interpretation remains challenging.  A small Bellman error in an L2 sense, where the L2 norm depends on training data, provides limited insight into the ultimate feedback policy's performance.\n\nThe linear programming (LP) approach to optimal control, pioneered by Manne [15], has inspired alternative approaches to RL and approximate dynamic programming. Early work includes [23], with error bounds established in [4, 5, 11]. Model-free algorithms emerged in [12, 13, 16] and [17, Ch. 5], where the term convex Q-learning (CvxQ) was coined.  Concurrently, logistic Q-learning [3] addressed a regularized dual of the LP in [12].  However, a gap exists: CvxQ was developed for deterministic control systems, while logistic Q-learning handles MDPs.  The stochastic setting for logistic Q-learning is currently limited to tabular [3] or linearly factorable MDPs [20].  CvxQ theory, in contrast, has few limitations beyond deterministic control systems.\n\nLP approaches are attractive because they inherently provide convergent algorithms.  Moreover, the L\u221e framework is more conducive to interpretable solutions, as performance bounds on the resulting feedback policy can be derived through Lyapunov function techniques [5, 11].\n\nThis work's main contributions are: (i) Introducing CvxQ for optimal control in stochastic environments.  We show that the constraint region is bounded under a persistence of excitation condition, generalizing results from recent work on deterministic optimal control [13].  We propose and analyze several approaches for approximating the convex program's solution. (ii) Proposition 2.5 reveals a surprising connection between CvxQ and standard Q-learning. (iii)  We introduce techniques for obtaining the rate of convergence in a mean-square sense (see Proposition A.1).\n\n\nCompared to existing literature [13], while the new algorithms and some analysis might be anticipated from the deterministic control systems theory, Proposition 2.5 is novel (and initially surprising) even in the deterministic setting. The variance analysis in Proposition A.1 is also new, leveraging recent Central Limit Theorem theory [24] to derive an exact formula for the asymptotic covariance. Complementary results in [21], motivated by MDP LP relaxations, rely on i.i.d. trajectory samples and Hoeffding's inequality to obtain sample complexity bounds for constraint-sampled LPs.  The covariance formula in Proposition A.1 resembles that from stochastic approximation (SA) theory, despite CvxQ falling outside standard SA recursions (see discussion following the proposition).\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 establishes the foundation for the CvxQ algorithms introduced in Section 3. Convergence rate analysis is presented in Section 4, and the theory is illustrated in Section 5 with a classical inventory control problem.  This work is an extended version of [14], to appear in the 2023 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control.",
        "In approaching tasks that require interactions with environments and those that benefit from utilizing tools like web search and code execution, LLMs have increasingly been employed. These tasks often involve a desired workflow or plan of actions based on heuristics that could enhance task-solving efficiency. To facilitate this, a common practice involves instructing LLMs with a single prompt to follow a specific procedure for task-solving. This approach, exemplified by models like ReAct and customized GPTs, entails iterative calls to the LLM with the same instruction, previous actions, and feedback from tools or environments. While LLMs possess the ability to autonomously determine task-solving status and perform subsequent actions, expecting them to always make correct judgments and decisions is unrealistic.\n\nTo address the need for more precise control and guidance over LLMs, a new framework called StateFlow is proposed in this paper. StateFlow models LLM workflows as state machines, where Finite State Machines (FSMs) are utilized as control systems to monitor and regulate task-solving processes. This framework operates by defining states that represent different stages of the task-solving process, with each state having a set of output functions to be executed upon entry. Transitioning between states is guided by specific rules, such as moving to the 'End' state upon a successful 'Submit' command.\n\nStateFlow enhances control over LLM-driven task solving by seamlessly integrating external tools and environments into the workflow. By evaluating StateFlow on various tasks, including the SQL and Bash tasks from benchmark datasets, significant improvements in effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated. StateFlow outperforms existing methods, such as ReAct, with lower LLM inference costs. Moreover, StateFlow can be combined with iterative refining methods to further enhance performance, as shown through experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark.\n\nThe main contributions of this work include introducing the StateFlow paradigm, which models LLM workflows as state machines for improved control and efficiency in task solving. Guidelines on building with the StateFlow framework, a case study illustration, and an ablation study are provided to showcase its effectiveness. By demonstrating the potential of StateFlow in enhancing LLM-driven task solving, this work offers valuable insights into optimizing the performance of LLMs in complex, multi-step tasks.",
        "The many-decades effort to understand, and then replicate, the brain's computational paradigm(s) is far from complete. Although neuroscientific experiment and theory have revealed much about the elements of neural computation, refining and combining them into a cohesive, widely accepted paradigm remains the subject of intensive ongoing research. One line of research targets deep, hierarchical spiking neural networks (SNNs), similar in structure to convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. Much of the SNN research targets improved energy efficiency when implementing supervised classification. \n\nIn contrast, the research reported here does not address problems for which state-of-the-art machine learning already excels. Rather, the goal is to tackle a problem for which conventional machine learning methods are less adept, but for which neuromorphic methods appear to be well-suited: online unsupervised clustering. Clustering partitions a set of input patterns into groups where the members of a cluster are more similar to each other than to members of other clusters. An online implementation consumes and processes inputs item-by-item, supporting real-time processing of streaming inputs. Because clustering is achieved online without metadata, the clustering function adapts dynamically to changes in the input data patterns. \n\nThis paper demonstrates that online unsupervised clustering is achievable via a simple, neuromorphic paradigm that can be described as a centroid-based clustering method. Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is at the core of the online clustering mechanism. STDP operates independently at each synapse, using only locally available information, making the learning highly parallel, fast, efficient, and displaying the emergent behavior of a brain-like learning mechanism.",
        "Action detection in videos, a challenging computer vision problem, aims to pinpoint the precise temporal boundaries of actions.  While many existing methods excel at detecting sparse actions in datasets like THUMOS and ActivityNet [12, 2], real-world scenarios present a denser, more continuous stream of actions.  Everyday life is filled with potential actions, making methods designed for sparsely labeled datasets less effective.\n\nSeveral approaches [9, 17, 18] have attempted to address this by modeling complex temporal relationships in densely labeled datasets such as Charades, TSU, and MultiTHUMOS [19, 7, 24]. These datasets reflect real-world complexities in three key ways: First, actions are densely labeled with fewer background instances. Second, they exhibit rich temporal structure, with co-occurring actions often following predictable patterns (e.g., taking a bottle before drinking, opening a book before reading \u2013 see Fig 1). Finally, they account for human multitasking, where multiple actions can occur concurrently (e.g., reading while drinking).\n\nExisting methods primarily focus on modeling the variation of visual cues across time, either locally [15] or globally [17], without incorporating semantic information about the relationships between actions.  However, real-world videos often contain complex actions with inherent relationships, both at the same time step and across distant time steps (see Fig. 1).  Modeling these class-temporal relationships is crucial for accurate action localization.\n\nTo address this, we introduce the Class-Temporal Relational Network (CTRN), which leverages relationships among action classes. CTRN first filters class-specific representations from input features at each time step.  Then, it utilizes this per-class representation to model inter-class relations in two ways: (1) Across different time steps, a graph-based layer learns dependencies between action classes. This shared relation map refines action features by incorporating information from related actions (e.g., opening and reading a book). A temporal aggregation layer allows the graph-based layer to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies. (2) At the same time step, a graph-based classifier leverages co-occurring action probabilities to improve detection performance.",
        "Deep learning models are now being utilized for a wide range of tasks. While many of these tasks may not necessarily require confident decision-making, such as advertising or content recommendations, global regulators are increasingly demanding that companies develop safer and more trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems (e.g., the European Union's proposal for AI regulation). On the other hand, AI tasks that involve critical infrastructures, such as secure communication systems, radio surveillance, and navigation systems, require robust and safe models before deployment in real-world scenarios.\n\nDeveloping safe deep learning models that can be relied upon in practical applications is a complex challenge. While one might consider amassing sufficient data, this solution is often either prohibitively expensive, hindered by confidentiality concerns, or simply unfeasible. Moreover, many tasks are continuously evolving, as seen with the impact of face masks on face recognition systems after the Covid-19 pandemic. Modeling the data is another approach, but it is not always feasible in every situation. For instance, while both yield correct predictions with high confidence on an in-distribution (ID) sample, a standard neural network exhibits a drastic decrease in confidence when faced with an out-of-distribution (OoD) sample, such as when trained with TrustGAN.\n\nOne proposed solution is to develop a deep learning model that excels in its designated task while also being equipped to flag uncertainties or abstain when confidence is lacking. Such a model would provide not only a decision but also an associated confidence level. This confidence must remain robust not only to rare samples within the training set but also, more crucially, to out-of-distribution samples. These unfamiliar samples, such as a bird mistakenly identified in an image classifier meant to differentiate helicopters from planes, necessitate the AI system to express low confidence levels. However, obtaining and utilizing OoD samples or datasets is often laborious and frequently impractical due to similar challenges encountered with training datasets.\n\nTraditional training methods for deep learning models often overlook the estimation of confidence in the face of OoD samples, instead focusing on optimizing performance with the training dataset. Despite this, most machine learning models provide some form of confidence estimation on their decisions, like the maximum class probability (MCP), albeit known for being unreliable and commonly overestimated. For example, a number classifier may confidently misclassify an image of a pangolin as the digit 5, revealing a flaw in the system.\n\nIntroducing TrustGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) pipeline designed to enhance trustworthiness and confidence, aims to address these challenges. TrustGAN targets improving the confidence estimates of a given model through the manipulation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. By generating adversarial samples, TrustGAN assists the target network in recognizing both efficient task execution and identifying distinctive characteristics of in-distribution samples.\n\nTrustGAN consists of two neural networks: a \"target model\" intended to excel in a specific task while providing reliable confidence scores on both ID and OoD samples, and a \"confidence-attacker\" network (a GAN) designed to challenge the confidence of the target network. The code for TrustGAN is publicly available on GitHub.\n\nNumerous other approaches in literature focus on enhancing the confidence estimates of neural networks, with TrustGAN either supplementing or potentially replacing existing methodologies. For instance, some studies incorporate dropout layers for confidence estimation, while others introduce additional neural networks to output confidence scores based on the target network's performance. Similarly, works like [6] leverage GANs to train a discriminator for confidence estimation, though this may necessitate deploying separate networks for prediction and confidence estimation on target hardware.\n\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of TrustGAN and its impact, we outline the training pipeline specifics, neural networks, loss functions, and training procedures in section II.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving readability and flow:\n\nIn recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful force in generative modeling, demonstrating remarkable success across multiple domains. Their applications span image generation (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Karras et al., 2022), text-to-image synthesis (Rombach et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022), audio/speech synthesis (Kim et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023), graph generation (Xu et al., 2022; Vignac et al., 2022), and 3D content generation (Poole et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023). Extensive empirical evidence confirms their ability to generate diverse, novel, high-quality samples, highlighting their sophisticated capacity to abstract and comprehend training data characteristics.\n\nThe foundation of diffusion models lies in a forward diffusion process {zt}t\u2208[0,T] that systematically introduces Gaussian noise to a data point x, creating a transition distribution qt(zt|x) = N(zt|\u03b1tx, \u03c3t\u00b2I). The coefficients \u03b1t and \u03c3t are carefully selected to align the initial distribution q0(z0) with the data distribution P(x) while gradually steering it toward an approximately Gaussian distribution qT(zT). To sample from the data distribution P, this process must be reversed, requiring the crucial but unknown data score \u2207zt log qt(zt). Diffusion models approximate these data scores using a score model s\u03b8(zt, t), typically trained through denoising score matching (DSM).\n\nOur research reveals an intriguing paradox: while the theoretical optimum of the score model leads to mere replication of training data (demonstrating memorization behavior), state-of-the-art implementations like EDM exhibit genuine generative capabilities. This disparity raises important questions about the conditions under which diffusion models either approximate the optimum (showing memorization) or develop true generalization abilities. Furthermore, it highlights potential risks, including privacy leakage and copyright infringement, as evidenced by recent studies showing the possibility of extracting training images from models like Stable Diffusion.\n\nThrough comprehensive empirical analysis of EDM on CIFAR-10, we introduce the concept of effective model memorization (EMM) - a metric quantifying the maximum number of training data points at which a diffusion model exhibits memorization behavior similar to the theoretical optimum. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings, most notably that memorization can be triggered by conditioning training data on random, uninformative labels. This conditioning approach results in more than 65% of generated samples being direct replicas of training data, a stark contrast to the original 0% replication rate.",
        "The rapid expansion of online social media platforms has led to a rise in misinformation, undermining public trust in truth and science. Unlike traditional media, where content is often rigorously fact-checked, the interactive nature of social media accelerates the spread of fake news through commenting and sharing, magnifying its impact. This makes detecting and countering fake news on these platforms both challenging and crucial [A\u00efmeur et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2024].\n\nTo tackle this challenge, abundant machine-learning methods are proposed for fake news detection. Besides utilizing single-modal or multi-modal detectors to extract features from content [Dong et al., 2023; Hua et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024], there is a growing interest in conceptualizing the online social network as a graph structure to leverage the rich social context. Among existing studies, the user-news bipartite graph is commonly used for detectors to model user engagement [Nguyen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023a; Su et al., 2023]. Additionally, the news engagement graph can be constructed to explore relations between news directly [Wu and Hooi, 2023]. Instead of capturing information in the global network, the news's local propagation structure is also investigated. The news-post propagation and dispersion tree [Bian et al., 2020] are constructed to aggregate information from two directions, while the news-user propagation tree [Dou et al., 2021] is constructed to capture user-aware in the propagation structure. Due to the diversity of the graph construction, Graph Neural Network (GNN) is allowed to learn distinctive news embeddings from different perspectives for news classification.\n\nDespite their effectiveness in detecting fake news, these detectors have increasingly been found to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks [Wang et al., 2023a]. This vulnerability may be utilized to manipulate public opinion or gain financial benefits. Therefore, it is critical to investigate adversarial attacks on GNN-based fake news detectors to assess and enhance their robustness.\n\nExisting adversarial attacks on GNN are primarily categorized into two types: edge perturbation and node injection. Edge perturbation techniques aim to alter the model's prediction by adding or removing edges in the graph [Z\u00fcgner et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023], while node injection approaches focus on generating and introducing malicious nodes into the graph [Tao et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022]. Although these methods show promise when the target graph is exposed, their efficacy diminishes in a more realistic black-box setting where the graph construction process is unknown.",
        "Sound source localization (SSL) aims at estimating the pose or location of sound sources, and it is a crucial research topic. Various signal processing methods have been proposed for SSL, which work well under certain assumptions such as high signal-to-noise ratio, known number of sources, and low reverberation. However, these ideal conditions rarely exist in real-world applications, necessitating special treatments. \n\nWith the increasing popularity of smart speakers in home environments, SSL can enable a variety of applications such as monitoring human activities, speech enhancement, and human-robot interaction. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly deep learning, have outperformed classical signal processing methods for various audio tasks, including SSL. Multiple network architectures have been developed to localize sound sources, adapting to challenging acoustic conditions and microphone configurations, and even performing simultaneous localization and classification of sounds.\n\nHowever, a significant downside of these data-driven methods is their need for extensive training data, which is expensive to gather and label. Acoustic simulators offer an appealing solution as they can generate high-quality labeled datasets abundantly. Yet, models trained on synthetic data often suffer a critical drop in performance when exposed to real-world data due to domain shift, where acoustic conditions are outside the distribution of the synthetic training dataset.\n\nTo address these challenges, several works have recently explored domain adaptation for SSL. Unsupervised methods using entropy minimization of localization output have been proposed, but they are not suitable for problems requiring multiple outputs. An alternative includes two adaptation methods for multiple SSL: (1) a weakly supervised method that provides the number of sources for real-world data, and (2) an unsupervised method based on Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) which aligns latent feature distributions for synthetic and real-world domains. Although the weakly supervised method improved localization performance, the adversarial approach did not yield significant benefits. Nonetheless, adversarial methods remain popular for tasks outside SSL, such as semantic segmentation in computer vision and other audio tasks like Acoustic Scene Classification and Sound Event Detection.\n\nIn this paper, we address the lack-of-data problem for 2D multiple SSL by leveraging simulation to generate a large amount of labeled data inexpensively. We then tackle the domain shift issue by training the localization model to ensure transferable knowledge to the real-world. The main contributions of this work include: (a) exploring two domain adaptation methods based on adversarial learning\u2014gradient reversal and label flipping\u2014to demonstrate their effectiveness for multiple SSL, (b) proposing a novel ensemble discrimination method for domain adaptation in SSL, which involves placing a discriminator at different levels of the localization model, and (c) extensively evaluating our proposed method on data captured from real environments. We ensure result consistency by conducting experiments with different random seeds and reporting their mean and variance.\n\nThrough our experiments, we show that our ensemble discrimination method outperforms standard adversarial learning approaches and performs similarly to localization models trained in a supervised fashion on labeled real-world data. To our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at tackling domain adaptation for multiple SSL without requiring any labels from real-world data.",
        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nLeague of Legends (LoL), developed by Riot Games, stands as the world's most popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game [3]. As of 2019, the game boasted eight million concurrent daily players [14], with consistent growth since its 2009 release. At its core, LoL features competitive ranked gameplay, where ten human players are matched into two teams of comparable skill levels. These five-player teams compete to destroy their opponent's base.\n\nFair matchmaking is fundamental to the player experience [31]. Riot Games emphasized this principle in 2019, declaring that ranked matchmaking should prioritize fairness [11]. This commitment has remained constant throughout the game's evolution. In 2020, Riot Games outlined their primary objectives: maintaining competitive integrity [12] and enhancing matchmaking quality [13] for ranked games. To create balanced matches between similarly skilled players, the game employs an Elo rating system, similar to that used in chess [26]. While this matchmaking system has seen improvements (c.f., [10, 11, 13]), it doesn't account for players' champion selections during team formation. LoL features over 150 unique champions, each with distinct abilities and playstyles [7]. Players choose their champions after teams are formed, but performance varies significantly based on their mechanical expertise\u2014defined as their mastery of a champion's abilities and interactions [8]. Greater mechanical expertise enables players to make faster, more effective decisions, crucial in LoL's fast-paced environment. This expertise significantly influences both individual performance and match outcomes.\n\nThis paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)-based machine learning model that predicts ranked match outcomes based on player-champion experience. Our findings demonstrate that match outcomes can be predicted with over 75% accuracy once champions are selected, before gameplay begins. These results highlight that individual champion proficiency significantly impacts match outcomes, independent of team composition. Furthermore, our research suggests that current matchmaking may not truly achieve balanced team formation, as champion selection occurs after team assignment. The findings also indicate that players should focus on mastered champions to maximize their chances of victory in ranked games, though this approach may reduce gameplay variety, as players typically master only a small selection of the available champion roster [5, 7].",
        "Since its introduction, the Transformer architecture [66] has become the dominant model for natural language processing tasks, replacing the previously popular recurrent architectures. The Vision Transformer (ViT) [16] is a straightforward adaptation of transformers for computer vision tasks, such as image classification. In this approach, the input image is divided into non-overlapping patches, which are then fed into a standard transformer architecture after passing through a linear patch projection layer. Unlike networks built from convolutional layers, transformers enable parallel processing and provide a complete field-of-view in a single layer. Together with other attention-based architectures, such as those in [4, 7], transformers have significantly influenced the design of computer vision architectures. Many modern architectures in computer vision either directly inherit aspects of their design from transformers or, at the very least, draw inspiration from the recent advancements in the field [7, 16, 62]. Consequently, substantial improvements have been observed across various computer vision tasks, including object detection, segmentation [18], video analysis [1, 19], and image generation [9, 31].\n\nWhile vision transformers have driven notable progress, the optimization of their design and training procedures has, so far, been explored only to a limited extent.",
        "Colorectal cancer is highly preventable thanks to effective screening methods that enable early detection.  The current gold standard, optical colonoscopy, involves searching the colon for mucosal abnormalities like polyps.  However, thoroughly examining the entire colon surface is challenging, leading to a polyp miss rate estimated at 25% [1].\n\nColonoscopy effectiveness hinges significantly on the physician's skill, experience, vigilance, and even fatigue.  Several quality metrics help ensure high procedural standards. For instance, Withdrawal Time (the time from reaching the cecum to removing the colonoscope) correlates strongly with Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) [6, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18].  Cecal Intubation Rate (the proportion of procedures reaching the cecum) is another key metric, ensuring adequate colon coverage.\n\nWhile these metrics are easily calculated, they provide limited procedure-specific quality data and are typically aggregated across multiple sessions.  Research suggests other factors also influence polyp detection [14], such as colonoscope movement patterns and examination style.  The hypothesis is that a superior examination style yields more informative visuals, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThis work introduces a novel, quantitative colonoscopy quality metric based on automated video feed analysis. This metric, computed locally in time, assesses the informational value of each video segment for colon inspection.  Because instantaneous quality is subjective and difficult to define, human annotation is impractical.  Instead, we leverage a machine learning (ML) model to build a meaningful visual representation in a fully unsupervised manner. This representation forms the basis of a metric strongly correlated with clinical outcomes.  We first learn visual representations of colonoscopy video frames using contrastive self-supervised learning.  Then, we perform cluster analysis on these representations and construct a learned aggregation of cluster assignments, creating an indicator of \"good-quality\" video segments strongly correlated with polyp detection.\n\nAlthough our approach is reminiscent of the phase detection method in [7], our focus is distinctly different.  Other studies have explored frame representation learning in colonoscopy videos, primarily for polyp-related tasks like tracking, re-identification [3, 19], and optical biopsy [20].\n\nBy measuring the duration of good-quality video segments during the withdrawal phase, we derive a new offline colonoscopy quality metric. We demonstrate a strong correlation between this metric and Polyps Per Colonoscopy (PPC).  Furthermore, we illustrate how real-time quality measurement can estimate the likelihood of polyp detection at any point during the procedure.",
        "The average time to identify and contain a security breach is alarmingly long at 323 days, with an average cost of $4.35 million, as reported in IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 2022 [48]. Despite significant investments in intrusion detection systems over the past decade, this issue underscores the urgent need for more effective intrusion detection techniques capable of identifying unauthorized interactions within compromised systems.\n\nOne promising solution to this challenge is the use of honeypots, which are powerful cybersecurity tools designed to mimic real devices or resources. Honeypots are of no legitimate use to authorized users, making them more attractive to intruders who are probing a system. They can be closely monitored for access or other forms of interaction, providing reliable indicators of a breach. More advanced honeypots allow for deeper engagement, potentially revealing valuable intelligence regarding an intruder's intent, tools, or malicious payloads [22]. Organizations such as Attivo, Countercraft, Thinkst, and Penten are actively researching and commercializing honeypots and related cyber deception technologies.\n\nA particularly effective type of honeypot is the honeyfile, which consists of fake documents designed to attract unauthorized users. Given that documents are ubiquitous and often contain sensitive information such as intellectual property and financial data, honeyfiles can be easily deployed and crafted to reflect topics relevant to suspected threats [47, 57]. By placing honeyfiles in document repositories or file systems, organizations can monitor them for access or exfiltration, serving as a breach detection mechanism. Additionally, the choice of topics or search terms used by adversaries can provide insights into their intent and interests [53]. The key to successful honeyfile implementation lies in the realism of both the appearance and content of the documents.",
        "Physical-layer authentication relies on detecting and identifying unique characteristics embedded in over-the-air radio signals, enabling the identification of the hardware of the transmitting source [1], [2]. Wireless physical-layer authentication is also referred to as radio fingerprinting when both detecting and extracting features from the received signal (fingerprint) to uniquely identify the transmitting source [3], [4].\n\nPhysical-layer authentication significantly enhances the security and privacy of wireless channels in two adversarial scenarios: spoofing and replay attacks. Spoofing involves a rogue transmitting source trying to impersonate a legitimate one, while replay attacks occur when an adversary re-transmits previously eavesdropped messages [5]. While spoofing detection can be accomplished through standard cryptographic techniques like digital signatures, in scenarios involving massive deployments (e.g., IoT), hard-to-reach devices (e.g., satellites), or when cryptographic overhead is excessive, digital signatures may be inefficient [6]. Alternative solutions may involve crowd-sourcing to validate the transmitting source by crosschecking context information [7], [8]. Replay attacks, dependent on specific protocol flaws, can be challenging to detect as the adversary re-transmits encrypted information, which may be considered valid if not timestamped. Authenticating the hardware of the transmitting source at the receiver can prevent both spoofing and replay attacks [9].\n\nResearchers have taken on the challenge of extracting fingerprints and developing effective detection algorithms by utilizing dedicated hardware on the receiver side with high sampling resolution and signal quality. Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) have been instrumental in enabling radio fingerprinting by offering high-resolution bandwidth to expose transmitting source features and a high signal-to-noise ratio to facilitate feature extraction by back-end algorithms. However, radio noise remains a major issue for current solutions, as the transmitting source's fingerprint is often obscured by channel noise, necessitating the development of effective algorithms for feature extraction [10], [11], [12], [13].\n\nRecently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been employed for radio fingerprinting in various scenarios such as ADS-B, WiFi, and Zigbee, leveraging their multidimensional mapping capabilities during learning to detect and extract reliable radio fingerprints. However, existing contributions have primarily focused on terrestrial links [13].\n\nDespite achieving promising performance, questions remain regarding the intrinsic time-stationarity of CNNs and how wireless channel characteristics like attenuation and fading influence learning and detection processes [13]. Real measurements on terrestrial wireless links have shown a significant impact on classification accuracy due to the wireless channel, emphasizing the need for more effective classification techniques. Notably, no prior research has addressed physical layer authentication for satellite transmitters, particularly those in the IRIDIUM constellation, due to their unique challenges posed by Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites' characteristics [8].\n\nThis paper presents the following contributions:\n- Introduction of PAST-AI, a new methodology tailored for radio fingerprinting over LEO satellite links.\n- Proposal of a novel technique to represent IQ samples for AI classification algorithms.\n- Demonstration of the effective utilization of CNNs and autoencoders for fingerprinting radio satellite transmitters.\n- Introduction of two classification scenarios: intra-constellation satellite authentication and satellite authentication in the wild, aligned with the adopted classification algorithms and their assumptions.\n- Provision of insights on algorithm parameter calibration to achieve high performance, with accuracy exceeding 0.8 for the former scenario and an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 1 for the latter (majority of satellites).",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Layout-to-Image Translation Using Double Pooling GAN\n\n## Introduction\nIn this paper, we address the challenging layout-to-image translation task, which has numerous real-world applications in content generation and image editing [2], [3], [4]. While this task has been extensively studied in recent years [4]-[9], existing methods often produce results with noticeable blurriness and artifacts. These issues arise from insufficient semantic dependency modeling, leading to intra-object semantic inconsistencies.\n\nTo demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, Figure 1 presents a 'Real vs. Fake' game, where viewers attempt to distinguish between real-world images and those generated by our GAN model. The challenging nature of this task reflects the significant progress made in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [1].\n\n## Proposed Solution: DPGAN\nTo overcome the limitations of existing methods, we introduce a novel Double Pooling GAN (DPGAN) and its key component, the Double Pooling Module (DPM). The DPM comprises two sub-modules:\n\n1. Square-shape Pooling Module (SPM)\n   - Captures short-range and local semantic dependencies\n   - Ensures correlation between pixels within the same object\n\n2. Rectangle-shape Pooling Module (RPM)\n   - Captures long-range and global semantic dependencies\n   - Operates in both horizontal and vertical directions\n\nWe also propose seven image-level and feature-level fusion strategies to effectively combine the outputs of both modules, enabling the generation of high-quality, semantically-consistent images.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Introduction of DPGAN for layout-to-image translation, featuring enhanced semantic dependency capture capabilities\n2. Development of the novel Double Pooling Module (DPM)\n3. Extensive experimental validation across five popular datasets:\n   - ADE20K [10]\n   - DeepFashion [11]\n   - Cityscapes [12]\n   - CelebAMask-HQ [13]\n   - Facades [14]\n\n## Experimental Results\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, our DPGAN demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods like GauGAN [5]. The combination of SPM (yellow grids) and RPM (horizontal green grids and vertical red grids) effectively enlarges the receptive field, resulting in improved intra-object semantic consistency. The most significant improvements are highlighted in white dash boxes in the ground truth images.\n\nBoth qualitative and quantitative results confirm that DPGAN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generating photo-realistic and semantically-consistent images.",
        "Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated human-level performance in various applications, such as healthcare, surveillance, and machine translation. However, in the healthcare sector, most intelligent diagnostic systems are limited to diagnosing only one or a few diseases. Once deployed, these systems cannot be easily extended to diagnose all diseases affecting a particular tissue or organ, such as the skin or lungs, as medical specialists can. The challenge in collecting comprehensive data for all such diseases, due to reasons like privacy concerns and limited data sharing, makes it impractical to train a system capable of diagnosing all diseases simultaneously. A potential solution is to enable these systems with a continual or lifelong learning ability, allowing them to learn to diagnose more diseases over time, without relying heavily, or at all, on the original data of diseases they have previously learned.\n\nSuch continual learning, particularly in new classes, could also be beneficial in other applications, such as automated retail stores. However, current intelligent models suffer from a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting, where new learning leads to the loss of previously acquired knowledge.",
        "The tour itinerary recommendation is a popular and challenging problem with significant implications for tourism and related fields such as transportation and logistics [1]. This issue has attracted substantial interest from both academia and industry. It combines elements of recommendation and planning problems. From a recommendation perspective, it involves aspects of top-K item recommendation and learning to rank, as we aim to suggest a subset of the most relevant points of interest (POIs) to a user in the form of an itinerary. From an operations research perspective, it resembles a constrained optimization problem, where the goal is to maximize the utility a user derives from the planned itinerary while ensuring it meets specific time and location constraints.\n\nIn this paper, we explore the tour itinerary recommendation problem from both recommendation and operations research perspectives, focusing on how recent advances in natural language processing have propelled research in this area. Specifically, we examine the adaptation of language models for the task of tour itinerary recommendation, such as the use of word embedding techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe for POI representation learning, and the application of transformer-based models like BERT for next POI and itinerary recommendation. Figure 1 provides an overview of the potential applications of such a framework.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Introduction and Context\n\nOperational test and evaluation (T&E) is a critical aspect of systems engineering, particularly for machine learning (ML) applications. There is an urgent need for messaging standards that support operational T&E of ML applications [1], especially for edge ML\u2014applications embedded within micro-controllers or hardware in deployed systems like industrial controls, robots, unmanned vehicles, and satellites [2], [3].\n\nThe need for operational T&E of edge ML applications is driven by two key factors:\n1. Assessment of potential degradation due to lifecycle phenomena like concept drift [4], [5]\n2. Protection against adversarial attacks [6]\n\nWhile researchers have called for new test architectures for ML [7]-[10], a potential solution may already exist in the IEEE Standard 1671 (IEEE Std 1671), known as the Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML) [11].\n\n# Understanding ATML\n\nATML is an XML-based standard designed for exchanging Automatic Test System (ATS) data. It provides a framework for describing, storing, and exchanging data about test and measurement systems [12]. Though developed for general use [13], it has found widespread application in testing electronic systems, particularly compute hardware and signal processors/generators.\n\nA significant enhancement to ATML was its integration with IEEE Standard 1641, which introduced standards for:\n- Sending signals (e.g., cosine waves)\n- Receiving and handling test results\n- Defining information within test signals\n\n# Challenges and Opportunities\n\n## Current Limitations\nML applications present unique challenges for ATML:\n1. ML information rarely fits parameterized functions like sine or cosine waves\n2. Testing requires dataset transactions between the test tool and the unit under test (UUT)\n3. ML applications are predominantly software-based, whereas ATML's software integration experience is limited [14]\n\n## Related Standards\nWhile other ML-specific standards exist, they serve different purposes:\n- Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) [15]\n- Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) [16]\n- Abstract learning systems theory [17]-[22]\n- Model cards [23]\n\nThese standards focus on ML model specifications rather than testing frameworks, highlighting the gap this research addresses.\n\n# Research Focus and Structure\n\nThis paper explores ATML's potential to address ML application testing requirements, specifically examining:\n1. Integration of test data payloads\n2. Implementation of software-based tests\n3. Modeling of various tests, including cross-validation and adversarial testing\n\nOur findings suggest that minor extensions to ATML through a new IEEE 1671.X standard may suffice, depending on test data specification requirements.\n\nThe significance of ATML lies in its potential to enable effective, near real-time operational T&E of ML applications\u2014a crucial component of AI lifecycle management, safety, and governance [24]. Its ability to facilitate data exchange between ATS components promotes test software reuse and third-party system integration [25].\n\n[Note: The example about the digital multimeter unit has been omitted as it seems less relevant to the main flow of the discussion about ML testing.]"
