        "Photo : jetcityimage ( iStock )\nIt\u2019s only October, but we can call it: Popeyes is having the best year among fast-food chains. As others tried to compete with new meatless burgers and drive-thru innovations, Popeyes won on the basics\u2014making really good chicken that people want to eat. So many people want to eat it, in fact, that a new Popeyes location in Arden, North Carolina is causing traffic problems for the unincorporated community just outside of Asheville.\nLocal news station WLOS has footage of the traffic, which shows cars backed up onto Airport Road and parked in neighboring businesses\u2019 lots when the Popeyes lot is full. According to WLOS, roughly 30 cars back up onto the highway during recent lunch and dinner hours. While some residents are obviously stoked about the new chicken restaurant that opened over the weekend, others say the Popeyes-related traffic is a nuisance.\nAdvertisement\nConsider this a heads up to other communities that may have a new Popeyes in the works: Get your department of transportation on board from day one. Maybe even consider a dedicated exit ramp.",
        "Your company was once at the forefront of the computing revolution. You deployed the latest mainframes, then minis, then microcomputers. You joined the PC revolution and bought Sparcs during the dot-com era. You bought DB2 to replace some of what you were doing with IMS. Maybe you bought Oracle or SQL Server later. You deployed MPP and started looking at cubes.\nThen you jumped on the next big wave and put a lot of your data on the intranet and internet. You deployed VMware to prevent server sprawl, only to discover VM sprawl. When Microsoft came a-knocking, you deployed SharePoint. You even moved from Siebel to Salesforce to hop into SaaS.\nNow you have data coming out of your ears and spilling all over the place. Your mainframe is a delicate flower on which nothing can be installed without a six-month study. The rest of your data is all on the SAN. That works out because you have a \u201cgreat relationship with the EMC/Dell federation\u201d (where you basically pay them whatever they want and they give you the \u201cEMC treatment\u201d). However, the SAN does you no good for finding actual information due to the effects of VM and application sprawl on your data organization.\nNow the millennials want to deploy MongoDB because it\u2019s \u201cwebscale.\" The Hadoop vendor is knocking and wants to build a data lake, which is supposed to magically produce insights by using cheaper storage ... and produce yet another storage technology to worry about.\nTime to stop the madness! This is the year you wrangle your data and make it work for your organization instead of your organization working for its data. How do you get your data straight? Start with these 12 New Year\u2019s resolutions:\n1. Catalog where the data is\nYou need to know what you have. Whether or not this takes the form of a complicated data mapping and management system isn\u2019t as important as the actual concerted effort to find it.\n2. Map data use\nYour data is in use by existing applications, and there\u2019s an overall flow throughout the organization. Whether you track this \u201cdata lineage\u201d and \u201cdata dependency\u201d via software or sweat, you need to know why you\u2019re keeping this stuff, as well as who\u2019s using it and why. What is the data? What is the source system for each piece of data? What is it used for?\n3. Understand how data is created\nRemember the solid fuel booster at NASA that had a 1-in-300-year failure rate? Remember that the number was pretty much pulled out of the air? Most of the data was on paper and passed around. How is your data created? How are the numbers derived? This is probably an ongoing effort, as there are new sources of data every day, but it\u2019s worthwhile to prevent your organization\u2019s own avoidable and repeated disasters.\n4. Understand how data flows through the organization\nKnowing how data is used is critical, but you also need to understand how it got there and any transformation it underwent. You need a map of your organization\u2019s data circulatory system, the big form of the good old data flow diagram. This will not only let you find \u201cblack holes\u201d (where inputs are used but no results happen) and \u201cmiracles\u201d (where a series of insufficient inputs can\u2019t possibly produce the expected result), but also where redundant flows and transformations exist. Many organizations have lots of copies of the same stuff produced by very similar processes that differ by technology stack alone. It\u2019s just data\u2014we don\u2019t have to pledge allegiance to the latest platform in our ETL process.\n5. Automate manual data processing\nAt various times I\u2019ve tried to sneak a post past my editor entitled something like \u201cBan Microsoft Excel!\u201d (I think may have worked that into a post or two.)",

        "U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday announced a new Justice Department policy that prohibits federal prosecutors from seizing journalists\u2019 phone and email records in leak investigations.\nThis comes on the heels of a Biden administration decision that the U.S. government will discontinue a highly controversial practice of using subpoenas and secret orders for reporters\u2019 communications data to track down government leakers.\n\u201cThe Department of Justice will no longer use compulsory legal process for the purpose of obtaining information from or records of members of the news media acting within the scope of newsgathering activities,\u201d Garland wrote in a widely-anticipated memo to his department\u2019s leadership and federal prosecutors.\nThe policy announcement means the Justice Department will no longer issue subpoenas, warrants and court orders to reporters, their publishers and third-party service providers to obtain the journalists\u2019 records.\nThere will be exceptions, however. The ban does not apply to obtaining information about a journalist who is under criminal investigation or a journalist who has \u201cused criminal methods\u201d to acquire information, Garland wrote in the three-page statement.\n\u201cThe prohibition does apply when a member of the news media has, in the course of newsgathering, only possessed or published government information, including classified information,\u201d Garland said.\nThe announcement comes two months after the Justice Department informed reporters from the Washington Post, New York Times and CNN that the department under former President Donald Trump secretly obtained their phone and email records. As part of a leak investigation, the Justice Department reportedly subpoenaed Apple for the records of two Democratic members of Congress, their aides and family members.\nThe revelations caused outrage among journalists and press freedom advocates and prompted the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general to open a review of the seizures. Garland promised to change the department\u2019s policy on obtaining journalists\u2019 records and voiced support for legislation to make safeguards permanent.",

        "\u201cI love having events in spaces that feel like home,\u201d said Aurora James, founder of sustainable shoe company Brother Vellies. She was clad in a top hat and checkered skirt and blazer, as though she had just stepped out of a Wes Anderson movie. And a cozy, at-home vibe is exactly what she delivered last night in the Wine Room at The Bowery Hotel\u2019s quaint Italian restaurant Gemma for the launch dinner of her new Nudes shoe collection.\nIn collaboration with Moda Operandi, James was inspired to \u201crecontextualize what nude means as a woman of color.\u201d As a designer attuned to the nuances of melanin and skin tones in general, James explained, \u201ca light pink can\u2019t be the only reference for nude.\" In a dimly lit room, a table\u2014scattered with a m\u00e9lange of sandy, chocolate, and hazelnut-hued flats and feathery sandals\u2014sat in the corner, dripping candles dotted the space, and soft jazz-filled the ears of all those in attendance.\n\u201cI wanted to bring together a small group of mostly women, from all different industries, that have had an impact on me, to kick off Black History Month and help celebrate this necessary collection,\u201d James said of the impressive group that included Elaine Welteroth, Jordan Casteel, Lindsay Peoples Wagner, and Ibtihaj Muhammed.\nDuring dinner, ladies got ready for their close-ups as a polaroid camera was passed around between courses of apple-hazelnut burrata and Gnocchi with wild mushrooms. The meal was topped off with a heartwarming speech from James and ended on a sweet note with warm chocolate cake.\nAnd when the meal was over, the laughter and girl talk didn\u2019t stop. It seemed no one was ready to leave because, as Welteroth put it, \u201cAurora has a way of building an entire whimsical world around her work\u2014it\u2019s the kind of world where women of color feel celebrated, centered, and desired. It\u2019s the kind of world I want to live in.\u201d",
        "Movie fans know that Hollywood opens its most prestigious films every December, right before the Oscar nomination deadline. The same is true of Broadway \u2014 except it happens in the spring, before the Tony nominations come out. This year's is an exceptionally crowded season, with 18 shows \u2014 half of them musicals \u2014 opening in March and April.\nLast season was all about Hamilton. Everyone knew it was going to win the Tony for best musical, but Barry Weissler, who produced Waitress, didn't care.\n\"They were a super hit, and we even had some of our investors begging us to delay for a season,\" Weissler says. \"'Go to Chicago,' one of them said, 'and then come in.' \"\nBut Weissler already had a theater and a cast \u2014 and even though Waitress didn't win a single Tony Award, it turned out to be a profit-making hit. While Weissler gambled, though, other shows decided to skip last season. Some of them are opening before the Tony deadline this spring.\nScott Mallalieu owns GreatWhiteWay.com, a company that sells Broadway tickets to groups. He says that on Broadway, timing can define success.\n\"The general rule of thumb is you don't wanna open a show in the fall, 'cause even if it gets good reviews, it's sometimes forgotten by the rush of all the new, fresh stuff in the spring,\" he says.\nBut Mallalieu thinks that rule of thumb may not hold this year because there are already three hit musicals that opened in the fall: Dear Evan Hansen; Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812; and A Bronx Tale.\nThat means there's not a lot of room for new shows to become hits, according to Jeremy Gerard, the theater critic for Deadline, who's been on the Broadway beat for four decades. He says all of those new shows \u2014 some of them literally opening one day after another \u2014 are fighting for a piece of a relatively small pie.\n\"The producers know there's gonna be a bloodbath,\" Gerard says. \"The total size of the Broadway audience is not all that fungible and, in fact, the numbers are going down. The grosses are going up \u2014 the amount of money coming in \u2014 because you've got these insane ticket prices, now being led by Hamilton, with its $849 top ticket. So, the grosses are all out of whack, [but] the actual audience numbers are going down.\"\nStill, in a business where one in four Broadway shows fails, hope springs eternal, and producers try every trick they can to make their shows stand out. Sometimes, they'll hire a star, like Bette Midler in Hello Dolly! \u2014 or they'll adapt a popular movie, like Groundhog Day or Amelie.\nBut some musicals, like last fall's Dear Evan Hansen, get lucky without any of that. That could be true of this spring's Come From Away, an original Canadian musical set in Newfoundland after Sept. 11, 2001, when American airports were shut down and locals played host to 7,000 stranded passengers. Sue Frost, Come From Away's lead producer, says it wasn't a sure bet.",
        "PHOTO: Michael Lewis, in the No. 32 Goodyear Mazda RX-7, took the GT-3 class win Saturday during the Hoosier Super Tour\u2019s stop at Buttonwillow Raceway Park in California.\nHoosier Racing Tire SCCA Super Tour competition got rolling Saturday on a weekend hosted by Cal Club at Buttonwillow Raceway Park in California. The day opened with a second round of qualifying followed by 25-minute timed races on the 2.95-mile circuit being run counterclockwise this year.\n2020 GT-3 Challenge Begins: This year\u2019s GT-3 Challenge presented by MPI opened this weekend as part of the Buttonwillow Super Tour event, and the series\u2019 first race took place Saturday in dry conditions.\nMichael Lewis, in the No. 32 Goodyear Mazda RX-7, started on pole and led every lap on his way to victory. Behind him, however, things got interesting: Taz Harvey\u2019s Mazda RX-7 held down second for most of the race. But Jose Rodriguez, also in a Mazda RX-7, hounded Harvey almost the entire time, grabbing second with only a couple of laps to go. Harvey brought his car home in third to round out the podium.\nThe GT-3 Challenge is a series aimed at boosting participation in the GT-3 class and supported by Mazda, Max Papis Innovations, Penske Racing Shocks, AiM Sports and Hoosier Racing Tire, with new partners Goodyear Tire, Carbotech Performance Brakes and Bell Racing Helmets jumping aboard this year. There are five scheduled GT-3 Challenge rounds in 2020, the others taking place at Super Tour events at Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta and Watkins Glen International, as well as Road America in July, and finally SCCA\u2019s National Championship Runoffs in October.\nThen Came the Rain: Saturday\u2019s second race group consisted of fast, open-cockpit formula and prototype cars. And just as they pulled off grid for their pace lap, a light rain began to fall on the circuit. On slick tires, these cars don\u2019t take kindly to wet surfaces. And on the opening lap in Turn 1, they showed it as a bunch of cars got squirrely, sliding sideways and collecting other cars. Those who emerged victorious after 25 minutes had one heck of a story to tell.\n\u201cThere was a big melee at the exit of Turn 1. I\u2019m not sure who was even involved in it, but cars were going everywhere,\u201d said Bill Weaver, who drove his No. 67 James G. Parker Insurance Associates Star Formula Mazda to victory in the Formula X class. \u201cI hit somebody. The front of my car launched up into the air, probably about three feet into the air. But it came down and the wheels were still on, so I just kept driving it. No front wing and a wet track is exciting to say the least. But we got it done, finished the race and had a great time.\u201d\nAaron Bailey, who drove his No. 21 BRE / HRX USA / Goodyear / G-LOC Brakes Stohr WF1 to a Prototype 1 win in the same race, also had a tale to tell: \u201cThat\u2019s the craziest race I\u2019ve been in for a long time,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI got hit on the start, but another car collected me and actually saved me from spinning completely. It started getting wetter and wetter, slicker and slicker, and I just tried to keep it together as much as I could and drive smooth.\u201d\nSweep Ceased: Over the last two years, Mike Miserendino has claimed all four Hoosier Super Tour Spec Racer Ford Gen3 races at Buttonwillow Raceway Park. On Saturday, Miserendino looked set to do it again as he came to the white flag with the lead over TJ Acker. But, on the back half of the last lap, the top-two drivers encountered traffic and Acker, driving the No. 62 MBI Racing / Cindescency racecar, ended up crossing the finish line first.\n\u201cWe had a couple of lapped cars to deal with, and I thought that would give Mike the tow to keep out in front of me,\u201d said Acker, who also took a win Saturday in Formula Enterprises 2 driving the No. 62 Bulldog Motorsports Formula Enterprises/Mazda car. \u201cBut I got a good run and I think we were three-wide coming off the back straight. I had the inside and had the position getting up the hill \u2026 and got the lead.\u201d\nDoubles on the Day: Winning one Hoosier Super Tour event is pretty special. Winning two Super Tour races on the same day, that\u2019s even more special. Besides Acker, two other drivers accomplished that feat on Saturday.",

        "A police body camera is seen on an officer during a news conference on the pilot program involving 60 NYPD officers dubbed 'Big Brother' at the NYPD police academy in the Queens borough of New York, in this December 3, 2014 file photo. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/Files\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Civil rights activists and some police chiefs are warning that the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to help local police departments buy 50,000 body cameras must come with firm rules on how to use the equipment.\nThey say that without proper oversight to address potential misuse, such as when police turn off their cameras during brutal acts, the wide deployment of the equipment could undermine efforts to build trust in police departments across the country.\nLast week, President Barack Obama announced a $75 million plan to help police departments buy body cameras after a state grand jury decided not to indict a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, for the shooting death of an unarmed black teen, sparking protests and conversations about excessive force and racial bias in policing.\nObama\u2019s plan, which requires congressional approval, calls for departments to undergo training, receive guidance on best practices from the Department of Justice and submit a plan of use for approval.\nThe department is still working out how thorough those measures must be.\nHowever, a Justice Department official told Reuters that should police violate the terms of such a plan, enforcement will fall to local and state authorities.\nCivil rights and civil liberties advocates are wary of the lack of a federal enforcement plan.\n\u201cYou must have an accountability mechanism,\u201d said Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee on Civil Rights. \u201cIf you have a department that has a bad record and is bad at following through on discipline, then body cameras are meaningless.\u201d\nPolice Chief Michael Chitwood, who has been using body cameras in his department in Daytona Beach, Florida, since 2010, said his experience has shown the need for strong oversight.\nHe said he fired an officer earlier this year for turning off his camera during a brutal beating of a woman, which violated a policy he had established.\nChitwood said the Justice Department should issue strong guidelines that could override local politics and union power that can tarnish policies.\n\u201cThe Department of Justice has a huge role in it because different jurisdictions have different internal power structures. Any policy that a commissioner comes up with, that (police) union is going to use its power to stop the cameras unless they get the policy that they want,\u201d he said.\nNot all police chiefs share his view. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want the federal government dictating how I use my cameras,\u201d said Ken Miller, police chief in Greenville, South Carolina, and formerly chief in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he used body cameras.",

        "A New and United Guyana (ANUG) says the time has come for the small parties with broad common features to unite to target the estimated 35,000 independent voters who want to bring an end to racial voting and use their seats in the National Assembly to push for policy and legal reforms.\nANUG Chairman, Timothy Jonas said his party has so far secured the backing of the Federal United Party (FED-UP) to contest the March 2,2020 general elections , but has not convinced the others including Lenox Shuman\u2019s Liberty and Justice Party (LJP).\nJonas said ANUG and FED-UP would be jointly contesting the March 2, 2020 general elections. He could not say what would be their joint name and symbol on the ballot paper, until representatives of the two parties hold a joint news conference later this week. He said ANUG\u2019s identity would not be preserved. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any danger of anyone being subsumed. As subsumed as the AFC (Alliance For Change) has been, they are still identifiable as the AFC so you have two parties which are standalone and self-sufficient and they will be working together. I don\u2019t think there is a fear of loss of identity,\u201d he said.\nANUG Assistant Secretary Kian Jabour said FED-UP was particularly interested in developing a constituency system in which people are actually represented by parliamentarians who they know. \u201cWe very strongly believe that our current system in Parliament is not one that represents all Guyanese regardless of who they are voting for and this is where our problem comes in. We have a system that in which the majority of our seats are allocated by political parties and are aligned and because of that those basically become yes-men. They have to follow party lines or they are so removed as we have seen very recently with the no-confidence motion,\u201d said Jabour.\nWhile the hearts of the small parties \u201care all in the right place,\u201d he said a number of them have not seen the wisdom of contesting the polls under one umbrella and sharing their resources. Jonas credited The New Movement party as a group of young professionals are \u201cgood-hearted sincere people, they want the best for Guyana\u201d and urged Guyanese to support them as an alternative although a few of their ideas are unrealistic.\nHe said ANUG has not spoken with Robert Badal\u2019s Change Guyana party, but talks are ongoing with the Citizenship Initiative. \u201cWe continue to be in talks with then. We have reached out to them. Members of our executive spoke to members of their executive, That is up in the air,\u201d he said.\nRealistically, he argued that small parties could not win general elections in Guyana but could hold the balance of power in the 65-seat National Assembly.",

        "Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu speaks during a news conference at his ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara, Turkey May 5, 2016. REUTERS/Umit Bektas\nBERLIN Politicians from Germany's ruling coalition voiced concern on Thursday over Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's decision to step down, saying his departure paved the way for President Tayipp Erdogan to rule unchecked.\nDavutoglu is seen in Europe as the more liberal face of the Turkish government, while Erdogan is heavily focused on creating a powerful executive presidency that critics say will tilt Turkey, an EU candidate, toward authoritarianism.\nDavutoglu negotiated a deal with Brussels on stemming the flow of illegal migrants to Europe, which German Chancellor Angela Merkel hopes will shore up support for her conservatives ahead of a federal election next year.\n\"Erdogan will be able to push ahead with his plans to change the constitution now without opposition from his own ranks,\" Niels Annen, spokesman on foreign affairs for the Social Democrats, junior party in Merkel's coalition, told Reuters.\n\"In view of the prevailing climate of repression and the current debate about lifting the immunity of opposition lawmakers this is bad news,\" he said.\nErdogan's ruling AK Party has faced accusations of rowing back on media freedoms and also aims to remove lawmakers' immunity from prosecution, a move widely seen as targeting a pro-Kurdish party in the Turkish parliament.\nJuergen Hardt, foreign affairs spokesman for Merkel's conservatives, also expressed concern about Davutoglu's departure on Thursday.\n\"Turkey will decide itself whether its future path leads to Europe or towards greater isolation,\" Hardt said in a statement.\nGerman politicians have long followed Turkish affairs closely. Germany is home to around three million people with an ethnic Turkish background and is an important trade partner for Turkey.\nThe EU migrant deal with Turkey has been Davutoglu's project and Erdogan, frequently critical of the 28-nation bloc, has appeared at times to belittle his progress.\nMore than one million migrants arrived in Germany last year, many fleeing wars in the Middle East. Their arrival has put pressure on local authorities and helped fuel support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\n(Reporting by Holger Hansen and Caroline Copley; Editing by Gareth Jones)",

        "Congress: Act Now To Repeal SALT Deduction Cap\nU.S. Rep. Thomas Suozzi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York recently revealed that they filed legislation to repeal the federal State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap. This proposal deserves swift consideration and approval by the House of Representatives and U.S. Senate.\nAs part of their 2017 overhaul of the tax code, the previous administration set a $10,000 cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes. Whether it was truly a petty act of revenge aimed at political adversaries matters little at this point; the result was a backdoor tax hike for Nassau residents that was folded into a so-called \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act.\u201d\nThen, it was painful. Now, amidst the sharp economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is simply devastating. Thankfully, President Biden has indicated his support for eliminating the cap and the concept enjoys bipartisan support amongst Long Island\u2019s Congressional delegation.\nMomentum is building\u2014and not a moment too soon. As a result of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, Nassau County and the region are still reeling from an alarming spike in unemployment and food insecurity. Repealing the SALT deduction cap would provide an essential boost to our long-term recovery and deliver meaningful relief to many Nassau families.\n\u2014Arnold W. Drucker\nDrucker, of Plainview, is Nassau County Legislator for the 16th Legislative District.\nThe Truth About The SALT Deduction\nThis is a response to the letter to the editor by Legislator Arnold Drucker on eliminating the limit on state and local taxes.\nThe SALT cap of $10,000 was initially described as a disastrously provision for New York citizens. It did not turn out that way.\nFor very many middle income families it actually resulted in a tax saving. While our SALT is over $15,000 the greatly increased standard deduction more than covered that and resulted in lower taxes. Studies indicate that many more lower and middle income families are using the standard deduction now (and saving money). One report stated that these families\u2019 deductions grew from $900 million to $2.3 billion from the higher standard deduction.\nThe SALT cap mainly affects high earners. So what do they do to compensate for it? They purchase tax-free government bonds and that helps New York State by lowering the borrowing interest\u2014a significant saving to the state.",

        "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Hawksbill turtles aren't the only marine turtles threatened by the destabilizing effects of climate change, but a new study from researchers at Florida State University shows that this critically endangered species could be at particular risk.\nIn a study published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers from FSU's Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science suggest that projected increases in air temperatures, rainfall inundation and blistering solar radiation could significantly reduce hawksbill hatching success at a selection of major nesting beaches.\nEarth's history abounds with examples of climate shifts, but researchers say today's transforming climate, paired with unabated human development, imperils hawksbills and other marine turtles in new and alarming ways.\n\"Marine turtles have been around for millions of years, and during this time they have adapted to substantial climatic changes,\" said Assistant Professor of Oceanography Mariana Fuentes, co-author of the study. \"In the past they have adapted by shifting their nesting grounds and nesting season to align with more favorable conditions. However, increasing impacts to nesting habitats from coastal construction, storms and sea level rise are jeopardizing their ability to adapt.\"\nTo evaluate climate change's effects on hawksbill hatching success, FSU researchers analyzed more than 5,000 nests from the five Brazilian beaches where a majority of the region's hawksbill nesting occurs. The team focused specifically on five climatic variables -- air temperature, rainfall, humidity, solar radiation and wind speed -- in order to render a more comprehensive model of the various and subtle effects of a changing climate on the sensitive incubation process.\n\"Research is lacking on how climate change may influence hawksbills, and this population in particular,\" said former FSU graduate student Natalie Montero, who led the study. \"We chose to study how climate change may impact hatchling production because significant changes to how many baby marine turtles are born can dramatically alter population stability.\"\nAs reptiles, marine turtles' body temperature regulation relies on external sources of heat. That makes hawksbills and their cousins especially dependent upon and responsive to air temperature. Nowhere is that responsiveness more apparent than in marine turtle nests, where extreme temperature fluctuations can influence egg incubation, dictate sex ratios and determine hatching success.\nFor some marine turtle species, rising temperatures may not necessarily mean less successful incubation. For example, a study from Montero and Fuentes published earlier this year revealed that, for loggerhead turtles in the temperate nesting beaches of North Florida, changing conditions could yield potential short-term increases in hatching success by 1 to 7.6 percent.\nThe outlook for the hawksbills, however, is not as rosy.\nMontero and Fuentes found that rising air temperatures, accompanied by increased rainfall and solar radiation, are projected to reduce overall hatching success at the Brazilian nesting sites by up to 11 percent by the year 2100. Higher temperatures may warm nests beyond the threshold for healthy incubation, they said, and increased rainfall could saturate the soil and suffocate the embryos.\nIf the turtles do incubate successfully and hatch, they then have to contend with skyrocketing solar radiation, which could bake the sand and cause the nests to cave in -- a major hazard for the hatchlings as they seek the safety of the open sea.\nWhile that may seem a dire and difficult future for a species whose numbers are already dwindling, Montero said there's still time for humans to soften the blow.\n\"Humans can help marine turtles in many ways,\" she said. \"Reducing coastal construction and protecting more coastal habitat will help ensure present and future nesting habitat is available. Reducing human impacts on dune structure and beach vegetation is also important. Additionally, reducing trash and microplastics on the beach can create a higher quality nesting and incubating environment.\"\n###\nMaria A.G. dei Marcovaldi, Milagros Lopez-Mendilaharsu, Alexsandro S.

Some people have told me that the color makes it look like broth.\u201d\nThe cafe\u2019s location is fitting, as the name Sangenjaya, literally \u201cthree tea houses,\u201d is derived from the fact that a trio of popular tea-drinking establishments stood there hundreds of years ago.\nThe cafe staff make tea using a method resembling the brewing of hand-drip coffee \u2014 pouring hot water by hand onto tea leaves instead of brewing them in a pot.\nTokyo Saryo offers different menus each month, presenting a selection from among 25 brands of tea.

        "The likely closure of a pilot training school in Hamilton could signal the end for others in the industry, which generates $226 million a year.\nL3 Airline Academy is described as one of the world's leading pilot-training organisations and is likely to close in February next year because students can't come into the country.\nAviation NZ Chief Executive John Nicholson said the importance of international pilot training to the New Zealand economy and the challenges faced have been pointed out to the Government since May.\n''L3 Academy may not be lost to New Zealand today, but urgent government intervention is required if [it] and the remainder of the international pilot training industry is to be retained,'' he said. L3, which earlier this year claimed $836,000 in wage subsidies, has set up its own isolation facilities.\nThe Government today gave no indication of when possible border exceptions could be made, but they would be reviewed ''as and when it is safe to do so\".\nThis year, the international pilot training industry is expected to generate around $51m in foreign exchange earnings with economic activity exceeding $226m, mostly in regional New Zealand. The industry employs more than 380 staff and has 225 flight instructors, with an asset value of about $100m.\nNicholson said that without visa approvals, the industry has stalled.\nNew Zealand's success with Covid, the quality of training provided and our great environment for training make us attractive to international airlines, he said. In September, 394 international students had signed up to train in New Zealand, a number had visas but none were able to enter the country.\nAn initial allocation of 440 visas, to be used over the next six months, would save the industry, Nicholson said.\nThat was the same number approved for Russian fishermen to ensure the survival of the deep-sea fishing industry.\nThe average international student pilot pays annual tuition fees of $80,000, spends up to 18 months in New Zealand and goes home on the completion of training to employment in airlines.\nPilot training fits the government strategy for international education and fits existing criteria for skilled worker border exemptions, apart from the student classification, said Nicholson.\nInterest in training in New Zealand has increased since September.

They perform at outrageous volumes until his hearing suddenly breaks down. Lou finds a community for deaf addicts run by a compassionate but tough leader named Joe (Paul Raci), who encourages Ruben to reckon with his future.\n\u201cMaking him an addict broke the script open because it is a movie about co-dependency and about facing your demons and your own sense of self,\u201d Marder says, adding that his grandmother was deaf and an alcoholic so he was familiar with deafness and deaf culture and also the surrounding issues.\nFull disclosure: I\u2019ve been friends with Marder for about as long as this project has been gestating.

        "Photo : Victoria Song/Gizmodo\nApple added period-tracking to the iOS Health app and launched a clinical study into women\u2019s health back in 2019. Now, the Apple Women\u2019s Health Study team has some preliminary data that affirms that, yes, there is an incredible variety of period symptoms suffered by menstruating people worldwide.\nThe findings were from the first 10,000 participants who enrolled in the study using the iPhone Research app and provided demographic data. Of that number, 6,141 participants recorded period symptoms and the most commonly tracked were abdominal cramps (83%), bloating (63%), and tiredness (61%). Or, basically, things anyone who\u2019s ever had a period could tell doctors if they just asked. About half the participants also reported acne, headaches, mood swings, appetite changes, lower back pain, and breast tenderness. Some rarer symptoms included diarrhea, sleep changes, constipation, nausea, hot flashes, and ovulation pain.\nAdvertisement\nOne takeaway was that regardless of race, ethnicity, age, and geographic location, symptom frequency was nearly universal. The participants reported cramps, bloating, and tiredness as their most frequent symptoms, and in similar numbers. So, you know, hard evidence that these symptoms can affect any menstruating person.\nThese findings probably seem ridiculously obvious to anyone who is ever regularly visited by Aunt Flo.

If you want to get into gender-specific conditions, prostate cancer gets 121,000 results and erectile dysfunction gets about 16,000 results. The problem gets worse when you consider that most researchers, historically speaking, have been men and excluded women from clinical research.

We\u2019re as one here and it was just another example of that.\u201d\nThe England Under-21 international doubled his tally in the 21st minute before Ayew completed the job from the spot, in the process maintaining the Swans\u2019 bid for a play-off place.\nCooper said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always been in the mix.

        "For people who can enjoy a glass of red wine in the evening, a new study suggests that a particular plant compound found in red wine can help with depression and anxiety. The polyphenol, resveratrol, has long been cited as the reason that red wine is thought to be good for heart health. Now, a study published in the journal Neuropharmacology suggests that resveratrol might also make red wine helpful in reducing depression and anxiety.\nThe study focused on the effects of resveratrol in mice, following up on previous research conducted in vitro (in a petri dish or test tube, as compared to living bodies). The conclusion of this research was that resveratrol may have protective effects against corticosterone. Corticosterone is a stress hormone, excessive levels of which have been have been linked to depression and anxiety.\nHowever, resveratrol is only one of the compounds found in red wine, and as a whole, alcohol is a depressant within the body\u2019s central nervous system (CNS). While CNS depressants don\u2019t necessarily make individuals feel sad or depressed in the moment, the depression or slowing down of CNS functions can ultimately lead to lethargy, muscle weakness, agitation, and altered judgment.\nIn addition, according to a 2015 review of 15 years\u2019 worth of published research on alcohol\u2019s interactions with the CNS, drinking alcohol can disrupt the sleep-wake cycle and lead to attention deficits (including blackouts often associated with heavy drinking). Depressing the CNS can feel good in the short term: the euphoria, altered judgment, and slurred speech that accompany a depressed CNS are all common experiences of people having a night out. However, because the CNS is a system that requires delicate balance, heavy and sustained use of alcohol can depress the CNS in a more permanent manner that can ultimately lead to long-term memory problems and depress the body\u2019s immune functions. Many of these short-term and long-term experiences of a depressed CNS, including the disruption of the sleep-wake cycle, altered judgment, lethargy, agitation and muscle weakness, are commonly associated with feelings that accompany depression.\nShutterstock\nAssociating red wine with anti-depression and anxiety is therefore a complex matter. While resveratrol has indeed been shown by this Neuropharmacology study to lower the levels of a stress hormone associated with depression and anxiety, the larger picture of alcohol consumption must also be considered. And this isn\u2019t the first time a similar issue has arisen regarding resveratrol in red wine.\nFor quite some time, popular science knowledge has suggested that red wine is good for heart health.",

Earlier in the day Keys, the 13th seed, reached the semi-finals for the first time by seeing off Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva 7-6 (7/5), 6-4.\nStephens cruised to a 6-3, 6-0 victory over Keys last September to win her first Grand Slam title in New York. \"When we get on the court, it's time to compete. But before that, we are not going to be weird and awkward and make it, like, weird for each other,\" said Stephens, who was close to going out in the third round to Camila Giorgi before winning 8-6 in a deciding set.\n\"Now I just had to go find her, because I need to tell her some juicy stuff. I just went and searched for her in the training room. \"Yeah, I think everything will be normal. And then when we get on the court, it's time to compete. It's go time. Until then, we're the same girls as always.\"\nIt is the first time that two American women have reached the last four at Roland Garros since 2002, when Serena Williams beat sister Venus in the final, after a semi-final win over Jennifer Capriati. Stephens, who was ranked 957 just six weeks before her maiden Grand Slam triumph last year after a series of injury problems, is now into the semi-finals of a major for the third time. \"To have two Americans in the semi-finals of the French Open, I think, is pretty incredible,\" said the 25-year-old. \"That means one American will be in the final of a French Open, which is another amazing thing. All in all, I don't think anyone can complain.\"\nStephens and Kasatkina traded breaks early in the match, before the American produced some ferocious hitting at the end of a marathon eighth game to give herself the chance to serve for the opening set. She did just that, with the help of a sumptuous backhand drop shot. The 14th-seeded Kasatkina kicked off the second set with a solid hold of serve, but Stephens broke in the third game with a venomous cross-court forehand and eased to victory after just an hour and 10 minutes of play.

        "* Q1 EPS $1.18 vs est. 0.94\n* Total loans up 9 percent to $56.3 bln\n* Says testing model to take brand to international markets\nBy Jochelle Mendonca\nMarch 21 (Reuters) - Discover Financial Services\u2019 quarterly profit handily beat Wall Street expectations for the eighth straight quarter, as more Americans used its credit cards, and the company said it is speeding up its expansion into international markets.\nWhile larger rival American Express has a strong credit card brand in international markets, Discover is just beginning to take its brand beyond U.S. shores.\nEarlier this month, the company said it signed an agreement with Diners Club Ecuador to issue Discover cards in that country.\n\u201cWe believe it will allow us to market test a model that could eventually become a framework for expanding Discover branded card issuance into additional countries with what to-date has been a purely domestic model,\u201d Chief Executive David Nelms said on the post-earnings conference call.\nLike American Express, Discover lends directly to consumers and also competes with Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc to process transactions for banks.\nIn March, the company also signed a deal with National Payments Corporation of India which processes transactions in India. The moves make Discover less heavily dependent on the U.S. consumer to grow profits in the future.\nIn the first quarter, Discover\u2019s credit card loans grew $1.6 billion to $45.9 billion in the quarter and total loans, including private student loans, grew 9 percent to $56.3 billion.\nTransaction volume for the payment services segment grew 8 percent to $46.7 billion.\nAlong with growing consumer loan balances and transaction volumes, Discover also saw bad debts fall in the first quarter -- signalling better times for the U.S. consumer.\nThe credit card lender and payment processing network set aside $152 million to cover future bad debt, down 64 percent from a year ago. Delinquency rates for loans over 30 days past due was 2.22 percent, down 137 basis points.\nBut the company said it may have to increase its provision for loan losses later in 2012 as its loan balances increase.",

We wouldn\u2019t be able to have the manpower, the resources.\u201d\nIn recent days, Clark County health officials have been forced to scale down the size of their clinic due to declining interest in the vaccine, Miller said.\nVolunteers like Dr. Dobson want to be busy again and hope they eventually will be.\n\u201cI feel sad for the population who is not getting vaccinated,\u201d he said.",

Most vehicle interiors are made from plastic, and it's the attention to detail that really makes you go \"wow, I want to spend $150,000 on that.\"Luxury sedans depreciate like stones, but somehow, we all forgot that a 2003 760i is worth next to nothing when BMW revealed that M760Li last year. The thing is freaking fantastic, weighing well over two tons yet still one of the fastest 4-door cars in the world.If you love looking at big sedans, you're going to love this. It's a photo gallery of six of the most expensive luxury sedans for the biggest players in the game. You've got a front 3/4 view on top and the interior at the bottom.

The wonderful burgundy leather door panels almost make you forget about the bad infotainment.Next, we have the 2018 Audi A8. It came out last year and seemed a little understated, even by Audi standards. But while not as bold as the Lexus, the dashboard's twin-screen setup is an amazing piece of technology. The BMW M760Li is defined by its matte black paint option, but the interior looks like it could have come from a 5 Series.Maybach makes the most expensive S-Class, and the facelift model with two-tone paint is amazing.",

The javelin thrower had been away from competitions for nearly eight months due to injury, but a throw of 83.90m in September 2018 at the 68th All India Inter-Services Athletics Championships in Jalahalli earned him the berth. Despite having undergone surgery on his troublesome right elbow in May, the Haryana-born athlete was still eager to participate at the Doha Games.\nBut unfortunately for Neeraj, things didn\u2019t pan out as he had expected. Still recovering after surgery, the athlete was advised by the federation and his coaches to heal his body. He had to give the World Championships a miss.\nAlso Read: Mirabai sets mark, raises the bar\n\u201cI had trained really hard for the World Championships. It was constantly on my mind, whenever I was at the training. But injury ki wajah se sab gadbad ho gaya,\u201d he told Hindustan Times in an exclusive telephonic interview from Potchefstroom, South Africa.\nA surgery just a year before the Olympics could really hamper an athlete\u2019s confidence. The fact that he had to stay away from the sport could have also derailed Neeraj\u2019s momentum after a successful 2018. It was the year in which he won gold medals at both Commonwealth Games and Asian Games. He also broke the national record with a throw of 88.06 metres and missed a medal at the prestigious IAAF Diamond League by a whisker. But the laurels at a price. By November 2018, Neeraj started experiencing pain in his elbow, the pivotal joint for a javelin thrower.\n\u201cI started feeling my injury back in November 2018. I continued to train, but was not having too many issues despite the pain. But it aggravated by April,\u201d he said. The inflammation in the joint caused Neeraj so much pain that he was unable to event pick up a javelin.\n\u201cThe X-rays showed severe damage and I required surgery, which I got done in May last year.\u201d\nAfter the surgery, a lonely, lengthy period of rebuilding and rehabilitation began for Neeraj, first in Mumbai and then at JSW\u2019s Inspire Institute of Sport campus in Bellary, Karnataka. This was the time when he was advised to not do too much hand movements. To keep his morale up, Neeraj indulged in fitness exercises and continued to challenge himself each day at the rehab.\nAlso Read: Saina Nehwal still aiming for Tokyo 2020\n\u201cAfter surgery, I immediately started cycling, because I was unable to move my hand. Later, I started hand and strengthening exercises and slowly started gaining my strength. I kept myself motivated by setting a target for myself each day to do better than the previous day. I was unable to participate in tournaments, but I was able to train, which kept my morale up,\u201d he says.\nDuring this time, Neeraj also separated from coach Uwe Hohn and started training alongside bio-mechanics expert Klaus Bartonietz. He moved back to National Institute of Sports in Patiala in August, where he trained non-stop till November, before travelling to South Africa with Bartonietz.",

I hate Koreans. I want to go back.\", and they quickly spread online after being found.Only about three days later, he exited his group 2PM and returned to his hometown Seattle, the United States.Regarding this, Jay Park said, \"It wasn't my entire decision to come to Korea at first. When I was asked to join JYP Entertainment, my mom suggested I should go for our future. My family was financially struggling a lot in Seattle, and she thought I would be able to earn good money if I had gone there.\"He continued, \"There were many popular artists at JYP Entertainment, so... I didn't know much about JYP Entertainment or Korea, but I went for my family. The life in Korea was very different to how I thought it would be though.\"He went on, \"Not only was it my first time living away from my family and friends, but I also had given up everything in Seattle for that. So, it wasn't very easy for me; the cultural difference and all. I may complain about that to my friends back in the States, you know, and that was what those were.\"\"After I started gaining attention as the leader of 2PM, someone had dug those comments up from the social media that I no longer used, and it became an issue. At that time, people kept saying, 'Jay Park hates Korea and Koreans.', but that can't be true because my parents are Koreans, and I'm Korean myself.\", he resumed.Jay Park wrapped up his story by saying, \"Anyway, I was ignorant and thoughtless then.",

        "Andy Wise walks you through the steps of filing a flooded vehicle claim, as long as you have comprehensive coverage.\n(WMC) - Watching the water rise up the doors of flood-swallowed vehicles in our weather coverage makes me cringe -- and reminds me of my own mistake.20 years ago, I drove my beloved '88 Honda Prelude into\nCar-buying consumers are at great risk after weather events like Hurricane Harvey and the threat posed by Hurricane Irma. They're at risk that flooded vehicles will eventually flood the market.\nBy law, when a flood drowns cars on a retail or auction lot, the lot must total out those vehicles in coordination with its insurance company and brand those cars' titles as salvage titles in the name of the insurance company.\nThe late Tom Zimmer, a former National Insurance Crime Bureau investigator and long-time source of mine, demonstrated for me three years ago how states will print salvage titles in the insurance companies' names -- and in a different color.\n\"A regular Tennessee title is going to be green,\" he demonstrated. \"Notice how the (Tennessee salvage title) is blue.\"\nThe problem is the law has little control over how private individual sellers may brand a flooded car's title.\nIt also takes days, even weeks to secure a salvage title on a flooded vehicle. There's the flood itself, then the waiting to get a claims adjuster out to conduct an inspection, then the determination of loss and liability, then the generation of the title.\n\"There's a gap of time between the actual incident and the branding of the title, so basically, you are unprotected at that point until those titles are branded,\" said Stan Norton, managing partner of City Auto and dealer member of the Tennessee Motor Vehicle Commission.\nBottom line, you should never buy a car without proof of a clean title. Period.\nIf you insist on taking the risk of considering a car that has either a salvage title or no title at all, Zimmer said use your eyes -- and your nose -- to determine if it may be a flooded vehicle.\n\"Are there artificial air fresheners in there that are probably covering up the odor of mold?\" he said. He also said look for sand, dirt or silt traces in the upholstery, on the floorboard and around the interior.\nChris Basso, public relations director for Carfax vehicle history reports, recommended before purchasing the car, have a reliable mechanic inspect the trunk, engine and spare tire well for water or debris.",

        "There's no denying residential space can be scarce in metropolitan Paris. Yet, that didn't stop French interior designers C\u00e9line Pelc\u00e9 and G\u00e9raud Pellottiero of Atelier Pelpell from creating a cozy, chic dwelling for a family of four. After coming across an old parking garage, the dynamic duo have completely repurposed the unit into a stylish apartment, and have designed a surprisingly spacious layout that features clever storage.\nAfter repurposing the former garage, the space has now been transformed into a surprisingly spacious 700-square-foot home.\nTo retain the character of the original garage, the designers kept many of the architectural elements in tact, such as the exposed concrete beams, ramps, and vaults. Because the former space only had a single wall of windows, the biggest challenge was to find a way to bring in as much natural light as possible, and to also give the interiors a more open feel.\nThe concrete ceilings and beams from the original garage were left in tact during the renovation to pay homage to the character of the original garage.\nOne of our favorite features of the new home is the amount of clever storage that was integrated into the layout. To increase functional space, the couple designed close to 70 closets within the thickness of the walls, ceilings, and floors. There is also an abundant storage along the entrance corridor, as well as in the hallway between the living area and bedrooms.\n\"With a single contribution of natural light from the windowed facade facing street, the apartment is designed to be 'turned' toward this light with its glass rooms. Elements holding the old garage function were kept as witnesses and graphic structures of the apartment,\" explains Pelc\u00e9.\nShop the Look\nLocal carpenters, along with the team at Atelier Pelpell, designed 80 percent of the furniture in the apartment. Transformable pieces, such as a kitchen island with a built-in extendable dining table, were used to maximize functional space.\nInstead of using swinging doors which take up considerable floor space, Pelc\u00e9 and Pellottiero used a curved sliding door to serve as the entrance to the master bedroom.\nThe couple also oriented both the bedrooms toward the \"window wall\" to allow better light penetration throughout these spaces.",

Stefanie Scott and Dermot Mulroney who play a daughter and farther duo in the film, paired up for a round table interview with us. The two discussed the authenticity of the horror in this film as well as Stefanie Scott doing her own stunts.\nQ: Coming into a well established franchise and you guys being newcomers, how well were you received by the cast and crew?\nDermot Mulroney: I was amazed at how much this existing storyline and this franchise really welcomed the new actors. Leigh\u2019s [Whannell] idea to tell the origin story and to go back in time, is just a fantastic idea instead of having it continue into the future and demon find another family and just go down a chain of episodes of families in trouble, this restarts it and it gives him [Leigh] a great license. For one thing, to bring back Lin Shaye, who\u2019s really the godmother of horror, why wouldn\u2019t you figure out a way to bring here back to life? So he did that and got to introduce a great new family story. It finds us in the middle of dealing with a loss of Quinn\u2019s mother, who is my wife, so it\u2019s really a fractured family at that time. You can see the love but it\u2019s not working out great and then tragedy strikes and all hell breaks loose. It\u2019s a great, simple idea of rebooting of a time beforehand \u2019cause it\u2019s six years previous to the first \u2018Insidious,\u2019 which in my mind, leaves room for \u2018Insidious\u2019 4.

The move was necessitated by an enrollment spike of more than 200 kids over the course of only a couple of years.\nAccording to Wilson, this put the district in kind of an in-between state where it wasn\u2019t big enough to support two full elementary schools, but its existing facilities were overcrowded.\nConsequently, the previous elementary school (now the intermediate school) could only accommodate students up to the fourth grade. Fifth graders had to attend classes with middle-school teenagers.\n\u201cWe never really like having the fifth graders at the middle school, but we did it out of necessity,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBuilding the new school gave us an opportunity to bring them back into a more appropriate age group.\u201d\nSummit Hill Elementary now hosts pre-K through second grades, while Howe Intermediate has third through fifth graders.\nThe district chose a pod floor plan that separates each grade level into a different hallway.

        "Scott Disick has gotten a lot of sh*t over the years for doing literally nothing, but here's the thing: dude is a millionaire and he didn't become one without putting in some effort. Scott actually has several profitable streams of income (including Keeping Up with the Kardashians, of course) and as a result, his net worth is GIANT. Much like his facial hair at the moment!\nBut before we get into it, please feast your eyes on this quote from Scott in which he compares himself to Martha Stewart: \"I actually do work, not just appearances and social media and events. I want to take it one step further, build my own furniture.\u2026 Like a modern day Martha Stewart.\"\nCool.\nGiphy\nLet's Start with His KUWTK Paycheck\nTragically, Scott's income from KUWTK hasn't been disclosed, but we do know that the Kardashians reportedly signed a $150 million deal to take their contract through 2020. And we also know that Scott's time doesn't come cheaply. He reportedly turned down Dancing with the Stars because they wouldn't pay him $500,000 for the season, so chances are E! pays him *at least* that much for signing his life away to Kris Jenner.\nGiphy\nHe Made Major Money from Nightclub Appearances\nHe might not want to be known for it, but the fact is Scott spent a lot of time doing nightclub appearances back in the day. According to a GQ article circa 2016, Scott made anywhere between $80,000 and $250,000 for just showing up and having a good time at events. To which I say: What am I doing wrong in life?\nHe Has His Own Reality Show\nScott blessed the world with his very own Kardashians spin-off show called Flip It Like Disick on E!, and tragically the reviews and ratings were....not amazing. It's unclear how much the network paid Scott for his valiant reality TV efforts, but the main thing to note here is that our dude is quite good at flipping real estate in real life.",

        "Some 12,000 Americans die every year in traffic crashes caused by speeding, according to government statistics. Officials have tried many strategies to get drivers to slow down. And now they might have found something that works, after researchers placed a GPS device inside cars that gives drivers an incentive not to speed.\nTraffic safety experts have tried using big flashing signs to tell you how fast you're going. (The psychological subtext: Drivers are rational, and they will slow down if they know how fast they're going.)\nWhen that didn't work, they tried putting cops on your tail. (Subtext: If you make the penalty for speeding large enough, drivers will slow down.)\nWhen that failed, they installed hidden speeding cameras on major roads. (If you don't know when you're being watched, you're more likely to drive cautiously all the time.)\nThe next iteration of the battle between speedsters and authorities may involve putting the cop right inside your car \u2014 and a psychologist in the back seat.\nResearchers have found that a small GPS-based device that constantly measures the speed of a car against the posted speed limit can slow drivers down, if it's paired with the right financial incentive.\nIn a \"proof-of-concept\" experiment partly funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, researchers found that drivers slow down dramatically when they are promised a $25 prize at the end of each week of safe driving.\nThe catch: Every time the test subjects went five to eight mph above the speed limit, they lost 3 cents from their prize. And every time they went nine or more mph above the speed limit, they lost 6 cents.\n\"We found that the incentive system was incredibly effective in getting drivers to reduce their speeding,\" says Ian Reagan, a traffic safety researcher at NHTSA. \"Egregious speed limit violations were almost eliminated \u2014 that's driving nine or more [miles per hour] over the speed limit.\"",

One of the players taking advantage of the opportunity is a former Northland basketball star.\nNorth Dakota State guard Heaven Hamling has signed an endorsement deal with Silverstar Car Wash, a local company based in Sioux Falls.

        "New guidelines address rise in opioid use during pregnancy The American Academy of Pediatrics says pregnant women with opioid addiction should have access to medication in new guidelines released Monday aimed at improving care for women and newborns affected by drug use\nOpioid use in pregnancy has prompted new guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, aimed at improving care for women and newborns affected by their mothers\u2019 drug use.\nThe number of affected women and infants has increased in recent years but they often don\u2019t get effective treatment, and the pandemic may be worsening that problem, said Dr. Stephen Patrick, lead author of the academy report released Monday.\n\u201cWhile we have been talking about the opioid crisis for years, pregnant women and their newborns seldom make it to the top of the heap. Infants are receiving variable care and not getting connected to services,\u201d said Patrick, a Vanderbilt University pediatrician.\nThe academy\u2019s report says pregnant women should have access to opioid medication to treat opioid misuse. Two opioids, buprenorphine and methadone, are effective treatments but pregnant women often face stigma in using them and doctors who prescribe them are scarce.\nThe academy says hospitals should written protocols for assessing and treating opioid-affected newborns. Many don\u2019t and practices vary widely.\nBreastfeeding and other practices that promote bonding should be encouraged, and parent education and referral to services for affected newborns should be provided, the academy says. Its recommendations echo guidance from other medical groups and the U.S. government.\n\u201cThis is a substantial public health problem that is still lacking solutions,\u201d Patrick said.\nAccording to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 7% of U.S. women reported in 2019 that they had used prescription opioids during pregnancy. One in 5 of those women reported misusing the drugs while pregnant.\nSome infants born to these women develop symptoms of opioid withdrawal, including tremors, fussiness and diarrhea.",
        "Populist Leaders Endanger Human Rights: Advocacy Organisation\nUNITED NATIONS, Jan 12 2017 (IPS) - Populist leaders pose a dangerous threat to human rights, fuelling and justifying intolerance and abuse across the world, said advocacy group Human Rights Watch during the launch of their annual global report.\nAmong the many challenges the world faces today, Human Rights Watch particularly highlighted the rise of populist leaders and its accompanying rhetoric that undermines the global human rights system in its 2017 World Report, titled Demagogues Threaten Human Rights.\n\u201cThe rise of populism poses a profound threat to human rights,\u201d Human Rights Watch\u2019s Executive Director Kenneth Roth said.\nRoth noted that populist leaders, who claim to speak \u201cfor the people,\u201d treat rights as an \u201cimpediment\u201d which allows for the scapegoating of minority communities as a way to address public discontent and solve pressing domestic issues.\n\u201cTrump and various politicians in Europe seek power through appeals to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and nativism. They all claim that the public accepts violations of human rights as supposedly necessary to secure jobs, avoid cultural change, or prevent terrorist attacks,\u201d Roth continued.\nPoliticians are increasingly revelling in, rather than shying away from, anti-rights rhetoric.\nPresident-elect Trump\u2019s presidential campaign reflected this politics of intolerance, addressing Americans\u2019 economic frustrations and fears of terrorism by proposing policies such as the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants, the creation of a Muslim registry, and the use of torture. If enacted, these Trump administration proposals risk not only creating human rights violations, but also undermining the entire human rights protection system, the report says.\nEuropean leaders have demonstrated a similar populism, gaining popular support by blaming economic problems on migration, the report stated. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted that the United Kingdom\u2019s campaign to leave the European Union (EU), also known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d used \u201cdivisive, anti-immigrant and xenophobic rhetoric.\u201d The committee called on officials to reject such speech.\nThough some progress has been made on relocation of asylum seekers, British Prime Minister Theresa May retained an anti-rights rhetoric, including denouncing \u201cactivist left-wing human rights lawyers\u201d from challenging UK military forces for human rights abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan, and stating the government\u2019s desire to exempt UK forces abroad from human rights law.\nHuman Rights Watch criticised leaders\u2019 rejection of rights of certain segments of populations in the name of protecting others, and noted that once human rights are undermined for a few, it opens the possibility to completely undermine such principles for all.\n\u201cYou may not like your neighbours, but if you sacrifice their rights today, you jeopardise your own tomorrow\u2026to violate the rights of some is to erode the edifice of rights that inevitably will be needed by members of the presumed majority,\u201d Roth said.\n\u201cIn fact, disregard for human rights offers the likeliest route to tyranny,\u201d he continued.\nThe rise of Western populism and its muted response to violations has emboldened others, legitimising politicians\u2019 attacks on human rights values across the world, the report noted.\nChina\u2019s Xi Jinping has led one of the toughest crackdowns on dissent, restricting expression and controlling access to information. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdog\u0306an has used state of emergency and anti-terror laws to similarly crush political and media opposition.",

(AP) \u2014 Alabama's largest coastal city announced plans Thursday to close public beaches because throngs of young people on spring break are ignoring rules meant to stem the spread of the new coronavirus.\nGulf Shores Mayor Robert Craft said the tourist-dependent city would shut down the beaches Friday through April 6 to ward off large numbers of students gathering on the sand.\n\u201cThis will be a threat to our livelihood, but it's also a threat to lives,\u201d Craft said. Private beaches like those next to condominium towers and beach houses will remain open.\nIn neighboring Orange Beach, Mayor Tony Kennon said students flocked to Alabama at least in part because of restrictions in Florida, which closed its restaurant and nightclubs while many in Alabama remain open.\n\u201cWe have more spring breakers right now in this town than we\u2019ve had in the last three years,\u201d Kennon said.\nCoastal officials have asked the state to limit beach access, but Gov. Kay Ivey hasn't announced any changes.\nProminent businesses including the Flora-Bama Lounge and LuLu's, a popular restaurant in Gulf Shores, have shut down temporarily, but others remain open.\nHealth officials said Alabama had 68 COVID-19 cases on Thursday, up 17 from a day earlier, with 14 of the state's 67 counties affected. The largest number is in the state's most populous area, Jefferson County.

He wielded his power with women in f****d up ways, sometimes to the point where they left comedy entirely. I could couch this with heartwarming stories of our friendship and what a great dad he is, but that's totally irrelevant, isn't it?\n\"Yes, it is. It's a real mindf***, because I love Louis.

        "As a volunteer crisis counselor, Rainy Roth does her work via computer from her town in Montana. She\u2019s also the children\u2019s ministry leader for her church.\n\u2014This essay is part of an occasional series provided by our partner organization Encore.org, which created the Generation to Generation (Gen2Gen) campaign \u2013 inviting those in midlife and beyond to connect with kids who need champions.\nI am very proud to be a volunteer crisis counselor with Crisis Text Line, which is a free, 24/7 hotline, all via text message. Since most of the texters who reach out to us are under the age of 25, this activity provides me with the chance to interact with the younger generation and connect with them in a compassionate way. I am also the children\u2019s ministry leader within my church. The two roles seem to intertwine, as I love being around children and helping them be the best they can possibly be.\nThis is also an incredible volunteer activity I could do from my tiny town (pop. 943) in Montana. The work is all done from my computer. Crisis counselors graduate from a six-week, 34-hour training program that includes video modules covering good contact techniques and issues such as self-harm, suicide, depression, bullying, and gender/sexual identity. I felt fully prepared before I began.\nAs a child, I suffered in silence with an anxiety/panic disorder. Back in the 1960s, doctors didn\u2019t have a term for what I was going through. My parents didn\u2019t understand it and looked at it as a discipline problem. Thankfully, as we progressed in understanding mental health issues, anxiety was brought to light. So now my feelings are, if I can reach out to one texter and tell that person, \u201cI get it,\u201d then the texter will understand it will be OK. Because of the training I received, I can give texters the tools they need to get some help. (And when appropriate, crisis counselors make referrals.)\nMy favorite thing about being a crisis counselor, oddly enough, is the active rescues \u2013 when people express ideation or plans within the next 24 hours to hurt themselves or someone else, and we send emergency services to do a safety check. The moment a texter tells me, \u201cthey\u2019re here\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s when I realize I helped someone get the help he or she needs.",
        "The Union Minister of State for Education, Subhas Sarkar, told the Rajya Sabha on November 22 that there are 3,900 vacant teaching posts and more than 3,000 ad-hoc teachers working in colleges under the University of Delhi currently. The ad hoc teachers' issue has been one at the forefront of almost every movement the DU Teachers' Association has been leading for the past few years but has not reached a resolution yet.\nThe Centre in its reply to a question at the Lok Sabha in August had said that there are 58 ad hoc teachers in DU. So how did it suddenly jump to 3,000? Well, the data presented in August was only of the departments at the university and not the constituent affiliated colleges. But this figure too, is not right, said Dr Shabana Azmi, an ad hoc teacher of Political Science at the Zakir Husain College, who contested the recently concluded DUTA elections. \"According to the electoral rolls, there are more than 4,000 ad hoc teachers, not 3,000. We have to analyse how the government came up with the number,\" she added.\nAd hoc teachers have been demanding absorption for ages now and we have seen the left-led DUTA fight for it. But Dr Azmi feels that it wasn't enough. \"None of the teachers' groups really fought for our cause. Even in the recent Executive Council (EC) meeting, they presented the issue along with 22 others and it got trampled. We need to raise this issue together and strongly,\" added Dr Azmi, a member of the Adhoc Teachers Front(ATF). \"While we did not have permanent jobs, the permanent faculty got promotions and we were previously told that there aren't any modalities for absorption. Why do rules and modalities come up when it's about us?\" she asked.\nThe ad hoc teachers are now afraid of even appearing for interviews as they claimed that there have been instances where the ad hoc teachers have been completely or majorly displaced from their posts and new recruits have been taken in for those posts. They also raised the issue of having a PhD as a criterion for marking. \"There are so many of us who have been embroiled in the job so much that they've not been able to finish their PhD. The minimum requirement used to be a Masters' degree,\" said Dr Azmi.\nWhat's the way out? The ad hoc teachers plan to approach the DUTA, the concerned officials and the ministry first before they go on a full-blown protest like in 2019.",

In any year where the annual increase in the approved WMATA operating subsidy approved by Virginia exceeds 3 percent (apart from legislative exemptions), the legislation directs the Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) to withhold 35 percent of state funding allocated to NVTC as capital and operating assistance to help its local jurisdictions meet their financial obligations to WMATA.

If we know how to keep our finances in order, it will make things much easier! Learn some new approaches to managing your money in this article.\nYou can save money by tweaking your air travel schedule in the small scale as well as by shifting trips by days or over seasons. Flights in the early morning or the late night are often significantly cheaper than mid-day trips. As long as you can arrange your other travel requirements to fit off-hour flying you can save a pretty penny.\nSet up a bank account for emergency funds, and do not use it for any daily expenses. An emergency fund should only be used for any unexpected expense that is out of the ordinary. Keeping your emergency fund separate from your regular account will give you the peace of mind that you will have money to use when you most need it.\nTeach your young child about finances by giving him an allowance that he can use for toys. This way, it will teach him that if he spends money in his piggy bank on one toy, he will have less money to spend on something else. This will teach him to be selective about what he wants to buy.\nIt is never too late to start catching up on your savings and retirement. Everyone is always zoned in on spending everything they make if not more than they make. Get serious, get angry, get real! Start saving money and investing and planning today for what you want for tomorrow.\nIf your bank charges high monthly fees just for the privilege of keeping a checking account, consider switching to a credit union. Most people are eligible for credit union membership based on where they live or work or organizations they belong to. Because credit unions are member-owned, they do not have to make profits like banks do and so they generally offer much better deals.\nStay away from credit repair offers sent to you via email. They promise the world, but they could easily just be a front for identify theft. You would be sending them all of the information they would need to steal your identity.

        "WORCESTER\u2014The Human Rights Commission Monday night received briefings on various aspects of a police body camera programs as it prepares to host community listening sessions on the topic over the summer and through the fall.\nCity Manager Edward M. Augustus Jr. earlier this year tasked the commission and the Police Department to work together to \"engage community conversations,\" about a body camera program as part of a broader slate of reforms aimed at dismantling structural racism in the city.\nThe idea of a permanent body camera program that builds upon a 2019 pilot program has received support from both police and community advocates, but the city administration has said it is holding off on implementing a full program in the department until a statewide task force looking at body camera policies, procedures, and best practices releases its report next year.\nCommissioners and community members Monday asked questions about what a permanent police body camera program would look like in the city, and expressed some confusion about why, or how long, the city has to wait for the state task force to offer its recommendations, when the idea of body cameras has such broad support.\nThey also raised concerns over privacy protections available for people caught on the officers' cameras, and for consequences for officers who do not follow department policy on activating the cameras. They expressed skepticism that the city would be any more forthcoming with public records requests over body cameras than it has been with other police personnel records.\nAt-large City Councilor Khrystian King said there has been a call for police body cameras for years in Worcester, and he told the Human Rights Commission Monday there is no moratorium on police body camera programs while the state task force meets. He said he wants to see the city implement at least another pilot program so it can learn more while it prepares to launch its permanent program next year.\nKing said there are best practices readily available out there, and that the city would not be reinventing the wheel by pushing forward with a program without waiting for the task force. He said a body camera program will provide transparency and accountability, and while it could provide proof of police misconduct, it could also exonerate officers against false allegations.\nResident Kevin Ksen said the commission and community members are still waiting for the name of an officer with 25 complaints lodged against them, and cited the city's continued appeal of a public records lawsuit won by the Telegram & Gazette over police records. Since body camera footage is also considered a public record, Ksen, who also Monday made a verbal request for the unnamed officer's records, said he wondered if the city would take a similar tact when asked for footage to be released.",

Starring 22-year-old Hailee Steinfeld, the series promises to explore the life of poet Emily Dickinson \u201cwith a modern sensibility and tone.\u201d Judging by the trailer, this sensibility appears to be one of teenage insouciance and badassery, not unlike the kind Steinfeld played in 2017\u2019s Edge of Seventeen. The real Dickinson was a noted introvert, but in this version, she\u2019s a lark \u2013 declaring boldly her intention to become famous, strumming an air guitar, and swinging her hair as if at a club. \u201cWere I with thee, wild nights would be our luxury,\u201d says Steinfeld\u2019s voiceover as her young Dickinson boards a carriage in the night for a tryst, or at least a transgression.\nNever mind that the poem from which she reads, Wild Nights, has been interpreted by some as suggesting religious ecstasy instead of physical; that Dickinson spent most of her life in seclusion, or that she sought little notoriety in her lifetime \u2013 Dickinson, the television series, seems ready to hook viewers on the name of perhaps the only famous American female poet of the 19th century, regardless of fact. It\u2019s less a question of historical accuracy, which can be tedious and unnecessary (see: the delight that is The Favourite), than one of faith. Dickinson promises to take viewers \u201cinto the world of Emily, audaciously exploring the constraints of society, gender and family from the perspective of a budding writer who doesn\u2019t fit in to her own time through her imaginative point of view\u201d. But what if that view has nothing to do with its inspiration, using a young poet as a shiny flash of Girl Power for views over her complicated, secretive, very real mind?",

        "WASHINGTON >> Pentagon leaders predict that coronaviruses may hit more marine vessels at sea following an outbreak of a carrier in the Pacific that infected more than 400 sailors, a top general said today.\nGeneral John Hyten, vice president of the Assembly of Employees, said one of the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt was hospitalized today in intensive care on Guam, where the carrier had been hospitalized for more than a week. He said that 416 crew members are currently infected and that 1,164 test results are pending.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good to think that Teddy Roosevelt is a one-of-a-kind problem,\u201d Hyten said at a Pentagon news conference. \u201cWe have too many ships at sea. \u2026 To think it will never happen again is not a good way to plan.\u201d\n>> RELATED: Your military won\u2019t tell how many cases of cocoavirus in Hawaii\nThe senior naval officer, meanwhile, said the biggest problem is the inability to test enough people quickly, including those aboard the USS Nimitz, the next U.S.-based carrier due to deploy at sea.\n\u201cThe challenge that we have right now is having that kind of ability where we can test in volume and speed,\u201d Adm. Mike Gilday told a small number of reporters today. \u201cI really don\u2019t have a good estimate right now about when this test capability would be available in the types of quantities we would like to see.\u201d\nHe said sailors on the USS Nimitz, which is in port ready for deployment, will have full restraint for two weeks before the ship leaves.\nA fisherman was taken to the Nimitz more than a week ago after showing symptoms, but the test was not definitive, the Navy said. Hyten suggested that a small number of sailors were sick, but the Navy said today that no sailors currently on the carrier have tested positive for COVID-19 or showing symptoms.\nA Stavridis, a retired naval admiral and former commander of the NATO, says he sees more problems ahead, and not just for the navy.\n\u201cClearly there is more to come. Stavridis said that the most via email is more than 400, \u201dsaid Stavridis. \u201cThe Navy and all services have some tough choices ahead of them in terms of whether they have to pull their units on the line to get them well or accept some level of injury due to the coronavirus. I think it will be a case-by-case approach. depending on the mission of the apartment. \u201c\nGilday said the navy learned of the outbreak on the Roosevelt, including how to move from preventing the virus to having it when sailors begin to show symptoms.\nAs of today, 3,190 have been tested negatively, with the result of testing on the rest of the waiting crew. About 2,700 crew members were removed from the ship and lodged on the base and at hotels on the island, which is a U.S. territory. Those who tested positive were checked by medical twice a day.\nMore broadly, Hyten says the outbreak aboard Roosevelt is an illustration that the military has adapted.\n\u201cThis will be a new way of doing business that we must focus on,\u201d he said, referring to the challenge of recruiting, training, deploying and potentially fighting in the midst of the pandemic. \u201cWe are adapting to this new world as we speak today.\u201d\nThe outbreak aboard Roosevelt began in late March and put the Navy in a leadership crisis. Thomas Modly, who resigned Tuesday as Navy Secretary, fired Roosevelt\u2019s commander, Captain Brett E. Crozier, for widely distributing a letter demanding faster action by the Navy to save his sailors.\nModly came under fire for flying out of Roosevelt last weekend and remarked to the crew that was harshly critical of Crozier.\nGilday said the investigation into Roosevelt\u2019s issue, which he ordered last week, is now complete and has begun to go through the report. He said he had not ruled out any options, including possibly restoring Crozier, if that is where the investigation led.\nThe key question, he said, is why Crozier felt compelled to send the memo, and whether it signaled a breakdown in communication and leadership.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking no options at the table,\u201d he said when asked about Crozier\u2019s fate.

        "13 SHARES Share Tweet WhatsApp\nThere\u2019s no question Mikael Backlund is playing the best hockey of his career right now. He\u2019s finally moulded into the centerman the Calgary Flames hoped he\u2019d become when they drafted him back in 2007. He set a career-high in points last season with 53 points (22 goals, 31 assists), surpassing his previous best 47 points from the 2015-16 season, and was even a legitimate contender for the Selke Trophy last season. There\u2019s no doubt the Flames would like to keep him around, but it\u2019s easier said than done.\nMoney Talks\nBacklund\u2019s current contract is set to expire at the end of the 2017-18 season, a contract paying him $3.575 million annually. Given his surge in production over the last two seasons, he\u2019s likely going to be seeking a raise, and deservedly so.\nWith his value likely now being around the $5 million mark, the problem for the Flames becomes extending his contract. Sure, it\u2019s only $1.5 million more than he\u2019s making now, but don\u2019t forget about Matthew Tkachuk, whose contract is set to expire at the end of next season. Tkachuk is set to receive a sizeable raise as he\u2019s currently playing on an entry-level contract, and is likely to receive an extension worth at least $4 million annually.\nBacklund has developed into a reliable two-way centerman who\u2019s become a big part of the success of the Flames, making him all the more valuable to keep in Calgary.\n\u201cHe\u2019s strong on pucks. He battles. And with his skating, he\u2019s able to get everywhere,\u201d said Flames assistant general manager Craig Conroy in a Calgary Herald article. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to run you over physically. He\u2019s not going to fight you. But he\u2019s going to battle in the face-off circle. He\u2019ll bump you. He finishes checks. He\u2019ll block shots. He\u2019ll do all those other things.\u201d\nRelated: Patience Pays off for Backlund\nHow to Swing a Backlund Deal\nSo, where will the money come from? Obviously, the easy fix would be finding a team willing to take on Troy Brouwer\u2019s hefty contract via trade, but that remains unlikely. Matt Stajan is currently in the final year of his contract, which equals a salary cap hit of $3.125 million. Given his age, 33, and the depth the Flames have at the center position, it\u2019s highly unlikely he will be re-signed, which opens up a large chunk of salary cap space.\nMatt Stajan has really aged in front of us \u2026 He looks how I feel when I wake up in the morning. pic.twitter.com/vFsa9wl4Vj \u2014 Stephen Burtch (@SteveBurtch) October 5, 2017\nKris Versteeg and Jaromir Jagr both have contracts expiring at the end of this season, with salary cap hits of $1.75 million and $1 million respectively. There\u2019s a chance the Flames decide to keep Versteeg for another year with Tkachuk still having another year left on his entry-level contract, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any longer than that. The departures of Stajan, Versteeg, and Jagr would free up $5.875 million in cap space, enough to offer Backlund the extension and raise he deserves, while also locking up Tkachuk.\nRelated: Flames Need to Swap These Three\nThe End Result\nIf everything works out, the Flames will sign Backlund to a long-term, front-loaded extension that could see him play out his career in Calgary. He has become a rock for head coach Glen Gulutzan. He can be relied on in any situation on the ice, at any time of the game, and can be counted on for at least 40 points in all seasons going forward.",

        "Study Conducted in Collaboration with the University of Oxford, Sleep Circadian Neuroscience Institute\nThe University of Oxford's Sleep Circadian Neuroscience Institute, and Big Health, the global leader in digital therapeutics dedicated to bringing millions back to good mental health today announced publication of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the efficacy and safety of Big Health's Daylight product in improving symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)1, in the journal Depression and Anxiety. The Daylight digital therapeutic is a fully automated smartphone-based program that leverages evidence-based cognitive and behavioral techniques to help people deal with worry and anxiety.\nThe study found that Daylight significantlyreduced symptoms of anxiety in trial participants, as compared to the control group at six weeks after intervention. By week 10 follow-up, 71% of Daylight users in the study achieved remission of GAD, as compared to 33% of those in the control group. Improvements were maintained at week 26 (uncontrolled) follow-up. The sustained maintenance of results is especially noteworthy since the 6-month follow up period coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic a time of heightened anxiety for people throughout the world.\n\"This trial confirms that Daylight is a safe, effective first-line digital therapeutic for worry and anxiety,\" said Professor Jasper Smits, PhD, Department of Psychiatry at the University of Texas, Austin. \"The measurable, consistent improvements in mental health status achieved by Daylight users in this trial are significant and meaningful, giving us confidence that as software, Daylight can offer relief to people suffering from worry, anxiety and related conditions.\"\nWorry and anxiety can significantly interfere with people's day-to-day functioning and overall quality of life. Anxiety is the most common mental health issue in the United States, affecting more than 40 million Americans (18 percent of the population) every year; GAD in particular, a mental health disorder characterized by excessive worry and anxiety that is difficult to control and is accompanied by unwanted physical symptoms and interference in functioning, affects 5-6 percent of the population annually in the UK and US, respectively. In the last six months, numerous surveys have reported increased rates of anxiety and stress due to the global pandemic.\n\"Anxiety and other mental health challenges cause distress to millions throughout the world, yet many people lack access to effective solutions, due to issues of stigma, or the supply constraints of in-person mental health care which have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Dr. Jenna Carl, vice president of clinical development and medical affairs at Big Health. \"The results of this study confirm that Daylight can have a meaningful impact on the people who need it most. We are excited about the potential for Daylight to help many millions more people back to good mental health, especially those who have limited access to in-person care.\"\nIn the trial, 256 participants were randomized to either use Daylight or be part of a control group which would receive the intervention at a later date. Participants were included based on meeting criteria for GAD with moderate to severe symptoms, assessed using well-established clinical measures (MINI and SCID for diagnosis; GAD-7 for severity). Assessments took place at baseline (week 0, immediately preceding randomization), mid-intervention (week 3 from randomization), post-intervention (week 6, primary endpoint), follow-up (week 10) and long-term follow-up (week 26 uncontrolled follow-up).\nQualitative feedback from the trial's participants was also positive and consistent:\n\"I really like the inclusion of animation..the combination of the visuals with the soothing voice of the instructor..this app has given me a lot more tools that I can and have been able to use to help control my anxiety. For the first time in a while, I actually feel like I am gaining control.\"",

Hyundai revealed the 2019 Santa Fe at the Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition with fingerprint access technology last weekend.\nThe Korea Herald reported the technology will be offered on the new crossover SUV in China.

I mean, how much farther can you go?\u201d Bartiromo asked. \u201cAnd what do you need to see from the Iranian regime to actually take these sanctions away?\u201d\n\u201cWell, with the new executive order, we have very, very strong authorities now across all industries, including in this executive authority,\u201d Mnuchin answered. \u201cIt gave both myself and Secretary Pompeo the authority to target additional sectors as needed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd \u2026 this is all really about cutting off money, oil sales, other revenue that would be funding their terrorist activities and their nuclear weapons development. So we continue to allow for humanitarian transactions with Iran,\u201d Mnuchin added. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to say that OFAC expedited all the waivers, as I said they would, as it relates to the airline crash investigation. And we don\u2019t want to target people of Iran. We want to cut off revenues that are going for bad acts.\u201d\nBartiromo noted the increased relations that Iran has developed with China and Russia in recent years, asking, \u201cWhy is China allowed to go around these sanctions and do business with Iran; 70 percent of their oil and gas going to China?\u201d\nMnuchin responded by noting that the 70% that Bartiromo was referencing was 70% of a very small number as the Trump administration has effectively crushed 95% of Iran\u2019s oil business.",

The Texans also signed Jaylen Watkins this offseason for depth, but outside of Reid -- whose brother, Eric, remains a free agent -- the Texans' situation at the position could be simply average, and that would be a relief.\nBiggest strength on roster: Quarterback. Let's not overthink this. Deshaun Watson is the straw that stirs the drink in Houston, and he's willed the Texans to two consecutive playoff appearances, despite an overall roster that hasn't drummed up big expectations. The Texans know how important Watson is to their success, and they've spent the last two seasons shoring up an offensive line that is steadily improving going into 2020. Watson accounted for 34 of the Texans' 44 offensive touchdowns last year (26 passing, seven rushing and one receiving) and nearly eclipsed 4,000 yards passing for the second year in a row. Though he will certainly miss DeAndre Hopkins this season, it's tough to doubt Watson can make it work with the array of qualities Will Fuller, Brandin Cooks, Kenny Stills and Keke Coutee present. Not to mention the Texans' depth in pass-catching tight ends (Jordan Akins, Darren Fells and Jordan Thomas), who are frequently targeted by Watson in the red zone. Where Watson goes, the Texans go, and that will be the case entering 2020 and beyond.\nBiggest weakness: Defensive line. First-year defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver will have his hands full with this Texans defensive line, which lost D.J. Reader via free agency and has to properly fill the void Jadeveon Clowney left upon his trade last August. The Texans ranked in the bottom eight in both passing and rushing yards allowed last season, finished in the bottom six in sacks, was second to Washington as the league's worst defense on third down, and finished dead last in red-zone defense.",

        "\"One done, two to go,\" tweeted Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, after Madhya Pradesh's new Chief Minister Kamal Nath waived off short term farm loans of up to Rs 200,000 taken from nationalised and cooperative banks.\nSoon, the newly appointed chief minister of Chhattisgarh, Bhupesh Baghel too followed suit and waived off farms loans worth Rs 6,100 crore of around 1.66 million farmers in the state. Though Rajasthan has not announced any waivers yet, Gandhi's tweet hints it might soon.\nFarm loan waiver is a certainty in these three states, where Congress-led government made a comeback unseating BJP government early this month. At least the announcements.\nThe quantum of funds that is needed for such an exercise and the ability of the governments to fund such one-time expense are the questions that remain. The amount that will be needed to waive off farm loans in each of these states will depend on what the fine print is. We need to know the conditions that farmers will have to satisfy to qualify for such loan waivers, and their numbers and the cumulative amount that finally add up to in each state.\nIf the recent experience of loan waivers in two states--Karnataka and Punjab--where non-BJP government came to power recently are any indication, clarity on these aspects and the real impact of the loan waiver announcement, will emerge only after several months. Even in the BJP-ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh, where farm loan waiver were announced as the fulfilment of poll promise, the actual payout was not as significant as compared to the total income (SGDP) generated by the state.\nIn fact, the mother of all farm loan waivers was announced by the Congress-led UPA government in 2008. Riding on the promise to waive off farm loans of about 44 million farmers, the ruling coalition of that time rode back to power for a second consecutive term that year.",

The practice is known as \u2018curriculum dumping\u2019.\nEvery time something terrible happens in our society, we expect schools to pick up the pieces. If only pupils learnt about the dangers of knife crime, acid attacks, revenge porn or gambling, we\u2019d manage to nip these problems in the bud.\nAll well and good if schools have the time and expertise. But with a packed curriculum, they usually don\u2019t.\nNow a campaign group, Parents and Teachers for Excellence, has scoured social media, newspapers and other sources to unearth 213 examples of suggested new \u2018subjects\u2019 in 2018 alone. It points out schools would need hundreds of additional hours to teach them.\nYou have to laugh. Well, that\u2019s if you agree with putting humour on the timetable. More OTT ideas floated by the public include sado-masochism and swearing.\nThe group\u2019s new report poses some common sense questions, such as \u2018what should schools stop doing to make time for your proposal\u2019? It also raises concerns over schools becoming \u2018catnip\u2019 for lobby groups and policy-makers.\nThe top three themes to make the list are health, finance and technology. It emerged this week that one of the most worthy topics \u2013 first aid skills \u2013 has already won the Government\u2019s backing and will be introduced from 2020.\nBut what about the others? Should schools really be teaching children how to use a toothbrush? Other hobby horses include the Commonwealth, workers\u2019 rights, litter picking, the RAF, marriage, how to avoid dog bites, oceans and feminism.\nAnd that\u2019s before you get to using trampolining to teach literacy skills, or tapping into Love Island to critique celebrity culture.\nParents and Teachers for Excellence concludes: \u201cWe believe that teachers and schools are the ones best placed to decide what their students need to know.\u201d\nYet sometimes \u2013 just sometimes \u2013 policy-makers do come up with good suggestions.",

One option is to follow the crowd and trade with the consensus. Another way is to go against the herd and adopt a contrarian strategy. When it comes down to it, the investor will typically have to make this decision with their best interests in mind. In general, no investor wants to miss out on a winning stock. Far too often, investors will be overcome with the fear of missing out and get into a stock way too late. Just because a stock has been over performing and seeing large gains does not mean that those gains are going to continue into the future.

        "TORONTO -- All but two COVID-19 cases at a shuttered Etobicoke secondary school appear to have resulted from student-to-student transmission and it is possible that some were contracted during school events, Toronto\u2019s top doctor says.\nAll 773 students at Silverthorn Collegiate Institute near Bunhamthorpe Road and Mill Road have been switched to online learning after Toronto Public Health declared an outbreak at the school on Monday evening.\nDuring a briefing at Toronto City Hall on Tuesday, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa revealed that at least nine of the 11 student cases identified at the school so far appear to be the result of student-to-student transmission.\nShe said that officials are also looking into whether some of the infections could have been acquired during school events.\n\u201cI don't have all the specifics around all the different events but I do know that there were a number of different multi-grade activities and events both inside and outside of school that were found in the course of investigation that certainly represented opportunities for transmission,\u201d she said.\nOntario health officials have repeatedly insisted that transmission within schools has been \u201cminimal,\u201d even as the province has regularly reported more than 100 new school-related cases of COVID-19 each day.\nBut the situation at Silverthorn Collegiate Institute could serve as a cautionary tale, given that transmission within the school environment appears to have played a role in the quick rise in cases.\nSpeaking with reporters on Tuesday, de Villa acknowledged that the Markland Woods community that the school is located in has a lower vaccination rate than the general population - 73 per cent of those 12 and up have been fully vaccinated versus 81.6 per cent city-wide.\nFor that reason, she said that Toronto Public Health has recommended that a mobile vaccination clinic be established at the school \u201cto try to bring that rate up.\u201d\nShe said that take-home COVID-19 tests are also available to be picked up from in front of the school today.",

They emphasized that online, the Visa cards could be used to pay for access to porn or purchase of illegal contraband.\nWith the scandal refusing to die down, Facebook VP Martin wrote Senator Warner on February 20 to correct the Research App record:\n\u201cAt the time we ended the Facebook Research App on Apple's iOS platform, less than 5 percent of the people sharing data with us through this program were teens.

        "Afghans were still awaiting the formation of their new government on Saturday, three weeks after the Taliban seized power and amid conflicting reports on the situation in Panjshir Valley.\nReporting from Kabul, Euronews International Correspondent Anelise Borges explained that the province was the only part of the country not under Taliban control.\nThe Taliban are facing resistance there from a movement led by Ahmad Massoud, son of the late Ahmad Shah Massoud, a guerilla fighter who became a national hero for fighting against the Taliban back in the 1990's. Shah Massoud was killed in a suicide bombing in 2001.\nRumours circulating on social media claimed that the Taliban had seized the province but no such official announcement was made. A Panjshir resident told AFP that the rumours were false.\nFormer Vice-President Amrullah Saleh is currently in Panjshir and has been calling on the international community to recognise that part of the country as Afghanistan's de facto seat of power, Borges reported.\nBut the world has so far been focused on the Taliban and what the next moves of their upcoming government might be.\nThe official announcement of a new administration, which was planned on Friday, is yet to come.\nOn Friday, Borges obtained a list with 13 names and titles likely to be part of the new executive.\nIt includes Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, likely to be appointed as the next prime minister, and Sheikh Hibatullah Akhundzada, who might be named as the supreme leader of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan under the Taliban rule.",

        "Rents in London have fallen during the Coronavirus pandemic, property portal Zoopla has reported. However, London is the exception and rents risen in a buoyant rental market across the UK as a whole, it said.\n\u2018Average rents in London have fallen by 5.2 per cent over the last 12 months, reaching levels last seen in 2014\u2019, Zoopla found. It puts this down to \u2018new working patterns and lack of tourism during pandemic\u2019.\nIn contrast, rents increased outside London by 1.7 per cent and rental has increased by a fifth over last year \u2013 strong demand that is being driven by a squeeze on lending to potential first-time buyers, said Zoopla.\n\u2018At the same time, supply remains constrained with levels of investment in buy to let still reduced following the changes to Stamp Duty (the additional 3 per cent surcharge on second properties) and the wider tax regime introduced from 2016 onwards\u2019.\nRenters are showing increasing interest in larger properties, especially those that may have access to outside space.\n\u2018The search for space, first seen in the sales market, is now being firmly replicated by renters. Zoopla\u2019s top searches for rental properties include the terms gardens, parking, garages, balconies and pets, reflecting a need for outdoor space and freedom necessary to cope with lockdown. There is also evidence that while the market as a whole is moving more quickly, the market for rented houses is moving more quickly than that for rented flats, reflecting this desire for more space among renters\u2019.\n\u2018For most of the UK, the demand/supply gap is underpinning moderate levels of rental growth\u2019, said Zoopla head of research Gr\u00e1inne Gilmore.\n\u2018The split in the rental market caused by COVID-19 has now crystallised and we are seeing the two-speed market firmly entrenched.\n\u2018We haven\u2019t seen the exodus of students from cities and, as more people are staying in the rental market given the squeeze on mortgage lending, higher levels of demand will continue to underpin rents. At the same time however, muted earnings growth will start to limit the headroom for rental growth in some markets.\n\u2018The search for additional space, both indoor and outdoor, within the rental sector is also set to continue as the country goes through additional periods of lockdown\u2019",

        "NEW YORK \u2014 Henri was downgraded to a tropical storm as it churned deeper inland on Sunday. Here's everything to know about this weekend's Northeast weather that's tropical in name, but far from its titular home:\nIS HENRI STILL A HURRICANE?\nNo. The National Hurricane Center downgraded it to a tropical storm early Sunday, and it weakened as it made landfall in Rhode Island at midday. By Sunday evening, it was weaker still as it moved over parts of western Massachusetts and Connecticut.\nWHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HURRICANE AND A TROPICAL STORM?\nIt's all about the wind. Specifically, the sustained wind speeds. The maximum sustained winds for a hurricane is anything above 74 mph. A tropical storm? 73 mph.\nAs of early Sunday evening, Henri's sustained winds topped out at 40 mph (64 kph), well below hurricane status.\nBut don't write Henri off. The greatest threat from a storm this size is water. Heavy rains cause storm surges and inland flooding, and historically, those things have threatened life and property more than high winds.\nWHAT AREAS IS HENRI SUPPOSED TO AFFECT?\nAfter coming ashore, Henri veered west, dumping massive amounts of rain on Connecticut and New York's Hudson River Valley, which could cause dangerous flooding. So far, the storm surge hasn't been significant like it was with 2012\u2032s Superstorm Sandy \u2014 the effects of which are still plaguing New York. It's forecast to bank east early Monday and skirt parts of Vermont and New Hampshire before heading out into the Gulf of Maine.\nWHO IS HENRI? WHO IS BOB? WHO IS GLORIA?\nA stormy trio. Henri had strengthened into a hurricane Saturday morning before losing steam Sunday. Had it made landfall as a hurricane, it would have been New England's first in 30 years. Bob was its predecessor, responsible for the deaths of 17 and $1.5 billion in damage in August 1991. But with Connecticut in Henri's path, some might better remember Gloria \u2014 the September 1985 hurricane made landfall on both Long Island and Connecticut and caused eight deaths and nearly $1 billion in damage.\nJE M'APPELLE HENRI \u2014 WHY DO I SHARE A NAME WITH A STORM?\nThese storms have human names courtesy the World Meteorological Association, which draws up a list of 21 names for each Atlantic hurricane season.\nSO WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS NEEDED FOR AN HENRI (OR BOB OR GLORIA)?\nThere are two ingredients needed for a storm to track this far up north: a tropical system itself and steering currents. Most tropical systems in the northern hemisphere run out or recur before they can make their way north, according to the National Weather Service.\nOK, SO THIS IS PRETTY RARE. IS HENRI'S PATH CONNECTED TO CLIMATE CHANGE?\nIt's just a tropical weather phenomenon, the National Weather Service says. But at the same time, climate change isn't off the hook when it comes to tropical weather \u2014 global warming exacerbates hurricanes, making them stronger and wetter.\nWHAT DO PEOPLE NEED TO DO TO PREPARE FOR HENRI?\nThis isn't New England or New York's first rodeo with weather writ large.",

        "Dr Burkhard moved to Singapore in 2010, and his role has been to build up the Singapore-ETH Centre in Singapore.\nAS URBAN centres like Singapore become more densely populated and business activity increases, more and more heat is produced in the process. A leading Swiss technical institute is working on a pioneering project with the aim of reducing the impact of heat on the environment in Singapore. Called the Cooling Singapore project, its progress could have far reaching implications for other densely populated urban centres around the world.\n\"The Cooling Singapore project aims to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect in Singapore and to improve outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) and liveability. The overarching goal of the Cooling Singapore initiative to remove heat from the urban system is also closely aligned with Singapore's pledge to reduce emission intensity by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030,\" says Remo Burkhard, managing director of the Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC), which has been set up by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH).\n\"The idea for the project was seeded by our SEC director Gerhard Schmitt in the Future Cities Laboratory, the first research programme at the Singapore-ETH Centre. The urban heat island effect can raise temperatures in parts of Singapore by up to seven degrees Celsius, with far-reaching effects on health, liveability, productivity and the economy. Based here in tropical Singapore, our researchers saw the need for more scientific and coordinated efforts to tackle UHI in Singapore and beyond.\"\nThe Cooling Singapore project was made possible in 2017 when Singapore's National Research Foundation provided the team with a grant under its CREATE programme. Led by the Singapore-ETH Centre, the project brings together professors and researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS), SMART (Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology), and TUMCREATE (established by Technical University of Munich).\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\nCooling Singapore, lead by Prof Schmitt, is an ambitious project, first and foremost, in raising awareness and interest in UHI and OTC, but more importantly, in building actionable knowledge and bringing key stakeholders together to work towards UHI mitigation and enhancing OTC.\n\"Working towards a cooler Singapore cannot be the remit of a single institution or government agency, since it has wide ranging implications for economic development, urban planning, building and construction, and transportation. In practice, it will involve close collaboration between scientists, agencies, industry, and policymakers,\" says Dr Burkhard.\nSingapore is the second most densely populated country in the world. Its small size and high density bring considerable challenges in mitigating UHI and improving OTC. While the UHI is a problem for Singapore, it also presents opportunities. In the tropics and sub-tropics, many cities are facing the same problems.\n\"Through good urban climate designs based upon scientific evidence, developed in close collaboration with the relevant government agencies, the Cooling Singapore team believes that these challenges can be overcome. Looking ahead, Singapore can become a knowledge hub for urban climate design and technology, with solutions developed here being applied in other cities in the region,\" says Dr Burkhard.\nOne of the key tasks of the Cooling Singapore project is to establish an inter-agency task force to actively engage the relevant government agencies and institutions. The task force, which is an integral part of the Cooling Singapore project, makes it possible to exchange knowledge among key stakeholders through a series of workshops, he adds.\nThe task force comprises members from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), Building and Construction Authority (BCA), Centre for Liveable Cities, Housing and Development Board (HDB), JTC Corporation, Land Transport Authority (LTA), Meteorological Service Singapore, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National Climate Change Secretariat, National Environment Agency (NEA), National Parks Board (NParks), Singapore Land Authority (SLA), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\"The Cooling Singapore team has also applied a microscale climate model to three case studies: Jurong Lake District, the Central Business District, and the Punggol neighbourhood. These have allowed researchers to understand how OTC varies over time and space, and to study the effects of different urban designs on mitigating UHI. Initial results of the studies point to the need for more scientific research into UHI mitigation.",

He and his wife, Karen, sat at the family's kitchen table with a mound of paper\u2014 some of it documenting milk prices and others the lack of income to meet the flow of bills.\nAfter the couple's appeal to different banks failed, Dale said he could sell a parcel of the farm and told Karen that it might be the way to pull through.\nBut Karen had a different plan, which she didn't share with her husband.\n\"He's too proud, but I thought if people knew, maybe they would help,\" she told the USA Today Network-Wisconsin .\nShe wrote a heart-felt plea \"to save a family farm\" on a social media site, GoFundMe, which is a crowdfunding platform to raise money.\nKaren's adult children and some of their friends shared the information on Facebook and donations began to trickle into the GoFundMe site. As the word spread on social media, Karen said she began to get phone calls with offers of help from local farmers, including one with extra hay.\nThe community including friends, family and people they don't know is rallying to prevent the demise of another family farm. The Cihlar Farm plight has spread to where donations are coming from people in other states.\nSince 1873 a member of the Cihlar family has farmed the 110 acres and it's been a manageable and family-sustaining business, Dale said. To manage the historical peaks and valleys of milk prices, Dale took to heart the budgeting his father, grandfather and great-grandfather modeled and accumulated savings to pay for large farm expenses and to smooth the inevitable price swings.\nIn fact, frugality is so ingrained in Dale's psyche that he didn't marry Karen until he made his last payment for the family farm.\nWhile milk prices are low, they've been lower, and his savings got him through those rough months.\n\"You're always saving, or trying to save, for the time when prices are down,\" Dale said ruefully.\nThe difference, now, is that Dale and other dairy farmers are facing the third year in a row of low milk prices.\nSavings are being wiped out among dairy farmers across the state: Wisconsin lost 500 dairy farms in 2017 and more than 150 have quit milking cows so far this year. The total number of milk herds is about 7,600 \u2014 down 20 percent from five years ago, according to the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.\nThe Cihlar farm had weathered these highs and lows until the perfect storm of dairy woes converged on the farm. The historically low milk checks became even lower after the deaths of several prized milk-producing cows and the $1,600 monthly payment for a manure storage system had eaten all of the farm savings.\nDale and Karen were squeaking by on the salary from her job at the Door County Medical Center, but they had reached the point where the savings were gone.\nFor more than 100 years, the 110-acre farm and 40 cows had supported the Cihlar family.\n\"I couldn't be the last one, I've always thought this farm was going to last, was going to be part of my family way into the future,\" Dale said.\nIn less than a month, the GoFundMe site Karen created for donations to save the family farm had raised enough to buy one cow. After one month, they've raised almost $8,000 of the $35,000 goal.\n\"I started to cry. I couldn't believe that people were actually helping us,\" she said.\nWhen Karen showed Dale the GoFundMe site and the donations, he was dumbfounded.\n\"There are so many things that need help and people fundraising for this and for that. I thought no one would ever want to help a farmer,\" Dale said, shaking his head. \"Well, I was wrong, this is just beyond words.\"\nThe average cost for a dairy cow runs between $1,000 to $1,600, but there are significant additional costs, including feed and veterinary care.\nWhile the money was the goal, it has resulted in something much larger than the Cihlar farm \u2014 sharing the plight of dairy farmers and that people can help.\nThere have been offers of free feed for the animals, and farmers leaving the business have sold some of their stock to the Cihlars at significantly reduced rates to ensure the farm will succeed, Dale said.\nAnd Dale's extended Cihlar family is pitching in to ensure the farm remains in the family.\n\"I'm the only one of all the cousins to stay in farming and this farm means a lot to all of my cousins, too,\" he said.",

        "Share This\nPRESS RELEASE \u2013 In the aftermath of the passage of Hurricane Maria, the local fire brigade in Dominica has been pressed into service for much of the clean-up and restoration, along with its day-to-day firefighting duties in the capital, Roseau, and beyond.\nLast week, the brigade issued an urgent appeal when a fire pump, a vital piece of equipment, needed urgent replacement. The loss of the pump meant that the brigade would have been severely hampered in the assistance it could render to communities in dire need of help.\nCIBC FirstCaribbean\u2019s Country Head in Dominica, Stephen Lander, became aware of the urgent need and contacted the bank\u2019s Comtrust Foundation, the charitable arm of the regional bank, for assistance last Friday. In less than a day, the fire pump was sourced in Barbados, purchased and transported by the Barbados Coast Guard to Dominica where it was handed over to Josiah Dupuis, Fire Chief of the Dominica Fire Brigade, by Lander over the weekend.\nThe fire chief expressed his gratitude on behalf of the fire brigade and the people of Roseau and the surrounding communities and said the prompt purchase of the pump would assist in the recovery and fire-fighting efforts of his force.\nCIBC FirstCaribbean has committed up to US$100,000 for relief efforts in Dominica, in addition to a previous US$450,000 which the bank and its parent, CIBC, gave to those Caribbean countries affected by Hurricane Irma.\nSince the bank started in 2002, it has committed a minimum of US$1 million per year for worthy causes across the Caribbean, totalling well in excess of US$20 million in the past 15 years.",
        "GOOGLE HAS DONE AN APPLE with its Pixel 3 XL by essentially taking the Pixel 2 XL, tweaking it a bit, and shoving a notch on top of the display.\nAll this might seem a bit \u2018meh' to Android phone fans, but we got our grubby mitts on the Pixel 3 XL to give it a quick whirl to see if it's worth your attention.\nDesign and display\nGoogle has clearly decided it's onto a good thing with its Pixel design, so it hasn't thrown out the baby with the bathwater with the new, larger Pixel phone.\nThe two-tone rear remains intact but this time eschews the textured back of its predecessor for glossy or matt glass finishes in a selection of three colours: Just Black, Not Pink (er, pink) and Clearly White.\nAround the front, the display has been upped from 6in on the Pixel 2 XL to 6.3in on the new XL handset. But the phone still has the same footprint of its predecessor; that's because it has pushed the display right up to the top edge of the chassis and has opted to use a notch to house cameras and the handset's earpiece.\nExpectedly, there's no 3.5mm jack as was the case with the previous Pixels, so you'll either need to opt for wireless headphones or adopt the dongle life.\nWith a 1440x2960 OLED panel, the Pixel 3 XL's display looks rather pleasant, with none of the odd colour shifts or muted shades that blighted the pOLED screen of the Pixel 2 XL.\nWe'd need to spend more time the handset to see if the display is up to scratch but photos, websites, and other content looked nice and clear on the screen, and the extra nugget of display real estate was appreciated.\nWhat wasn't appreciated was the chunky notch. We're getting used to display notches by now, but by all the gods of tech, the Pixel 3 XL's notch is not a pleasant thing to behold.\nWhile some notches, like that found on the OnePlus 6, are small enough to not be intrusive, the shape and depth of the Pixel 3 XL's notch is the opposite. We couldn't help but feel our eyes drawn to it. That's probably because it's holding a pair of cameras but we don't feel it has been as well implemented as some other notches.\nStill, if we had longer with the phone we may be able to get used to it, and overall the display is nice enough, at first glance at least, to warrant the inclusion of the notch.\nAnd despite the larger display, the Pixel 3 XL doesn't feel too big in the hand though it isn't exactly small either. A slightly more rounded design and the smooth back makes it feel more comfortable to hold, though it feels a bit more slippery than its predecessor.",

        "Extreme weapons from the SA National Defence Force (SANDF), including a machine gun that rips apart its targets, have been stolen and in some cases apparently smuggled out of South Africa for use in warzones.\nAnd loopholes in firearms legislation may have made this easier.\nNews24 also understands there are fears that in some cases, the firearms secretly smuggled out of the border may have been used against South African soldiers stationed in other countries.\nWhile scores of the weapons, including rocket launchers, were intercepted before being taken out of South Africa, sources say many more were taken across borders and are being used in conflict zones.\nThere are also fears that stolen military weapons could be stockpiled and used against the state.\nNews24 is in possession of a National Prosecuting Authority letter to the Western Cape police commissioner, dated August last year, about a mammoth firearms probe.\nThe letter details why the removal of the lead investigator in the matter could \"prove to be detrimental\".\nIt goes on to say that an initial firearms investigation had been broadened.\nIt says information had surfaced on \"how loopholes in the firearms legislation and regulations are used to facilitate trans-border smuggling of firearms to other countries from South Africa\".\n\"Further investigation is therefore required into the import and export of firearms by individuals and or arms dealers for illicit means and this possible violation of South Africa's arms embargoes and international protocols of which South Africa is a signatory.\"\nThe letter said that a probe into an arms dealer had \"demonstrated that firearms could possibly be stockpiled for crimes against the state by right-wing groups\".\nIn December 2015, police officers uncovered thousands of rounds of ammunition, silencers, weapons, and Nazi and AWB paraphernalia during a raid on an elderly man's flat in Bothasig, Cape Town.\nKeith Conroy, 71, said to have been one of the late Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) leader Eugene Terre'Blanche's right-hand men, was later arrested and charged.\nThe letter said the initial probe had spurred another investigation into \"the theft of firearms from military bases stockpiled possibly for crimes against the state by right-wing groups\".\nApart from the smuggling of the SANDF weapons for fighting, a source has told News24 that military guns were being channelled for another reason - to meet the demand of an underground market where collectors vie to get weapons used in wars and battles.\nThe more a firearm has been used in warfare, the higher its value.\nThe SANDF did not respond to detailed questions sent by News24 on Wednesday.\nThe SA Police Service said it would provide comment later.\n\"We will attend to it... it requires a lot of attention across different fields,\" spokesperson Sally de Beer said.",
        "Now that Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., and agreed to dish on his former boss, some Trump-watchers are suggesting that impeachment may be around the corner. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start talking about impeachment,\u201d announced a Saturday column on CNN.com. The Flynn deal, declared former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Litman in Friday\u2019s New York Times, \u201cportends the likelihood of impeachable charges being brought against the president of the United States.\u201d That may be true. But bringing impeachment charges against Trump, and actually forcing him from office, are two vastly different things. And while the former may be more likely today than it was half a year ago, the latter is actually less likely. Since Robert Mueller became special counsel in May, the chances of the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment\u2014and the Senate ratifying them\u2014have probably gone down. That\u2019s because impeachment is less a legal process than a political one. Passing articles of impeachment requires a majority of the House. Were such a vote held today\u2014even if every Democrat voted yes\u2014it would still require 22 Republicans. If Democrats take the House next fall, they could then pass articles of impeachment on their own. But ratifying those articles would require two-thirds of the Senate, which would probably require at least 15 Republican votes.\nThat kind of mass Republican defection has grown harder, not easier, to imagine. It\u2019s grown harder because the last six months have demonstrated that GOP voters will stick with Trump despite his lunacy, and punish those Republican politicians who do not. Among Republicans, Trump\u2019s approval rating has held remarkably steady. The week Mueller was named, according to Gallup, Trump\u2019s GOP support stood at 84 percent.",

        "Fran\u00e7ois Legault, the former Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois minister whose Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec party leads the pre-election polls, has discovered one of the advantages of Canada\u2019s federal system: it allows a politician to pass the loonie to another level of government.\nThis week, L\u2019actualit\u00e9 magazine published the latest version of the CAQ\u2019s immigration policy, featuring its threat to have immigrants expelled after four years in Quebec if they have not passed French and \u201cvalues\u201d tests.\nThe leaked document, as reported by the magazine, makes it clear that a Coalition government would not expel the immigrants itself, since the province does not have the power to do so.\nRather, it would deny them the Quebec selection certificate that, by agreement between the province and Ottawa, they need in order to stay in Canada as permanent residents.\nIt would then snitch to Ottawa that they are in the country illegally. And it would leave it up to the feds to do the dirty work of either removing them to another part of Canada or kicking them out of the country entirely.\n\u201cThe Quebec government will send an official notice to the federal government to inform it of the presence in Canadian territory of a person without status,\u201d the policy says. \u201cThe federal government will then decide what measures it intends to take.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unlikely, however, that the government of Canada, especially one led by Justin Trudeau, would expel an immigrant family again after four years here because a stay-at-home mom failed a test.\nSo, the CAQ could take the credit for introducing a policy to protect the French language and Quebec values, and blame the feds for not enforcing it. It\u2019s a cynical scheme.\nDon\u2019t ask the Coalition exactly what those values are. So that it can duck that question until after October\u2019s general election, the CAQ passes the loonie again, this time to anonymous, unelected civil servants, who would draw up the values test based on the Quebec charter of rights.\nIn fact, for Legault\u2019s sake, don\u2019t ask him for too many details about how his policy would be applied. Referring to the facial veils worn by some Muslim women, the Quebecor media reported, he \u201cat first said he agreed that a woman could pass the values test with her full veil, before changing his mind.\u201d And that\u2019s in the same interview.\nHe sounded like Liberal Justice Minister St\u00e9phanie Vall\u00e9e last year, in her indecision over whether her law requiring public services to be given and received with the face uncovered would allow bus passengers to wear sunglasses.",

The Ordinance provided for a hike in the GST cess on a range of cars from mid-size to hybrid variants and the luxury ones to 25 per cent.\nIn reply to a short debate, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the funds collected following hike in cess on luxury vehicles will be used to compensate states for revenue loss on account of implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).\nHe said the GST Council, which comprises state finance ministers, meets every month and takes decision on rationalisation of taxes in the backdrop of revenue collection.\nParticipating in the discussion, members demanded that the GST rate should be reduced on a variety of items including sanitary napkins, agriculture equipments, handicrafts, handloom items and sports goods. Some members even suggested that there should be single tax slab instead of four.\nThe debate over the GST compensation bill continued amid slogan-shouting by Congress and TMC members who demanded resignation of Hegde for his controversial comments.\nAt a function in Karnataka on Sunday, Hegde had reportedly said people should identify themselves by their religions and \u201cthose who, without knowing about their parental blood, call themselves secular, they don\u2019t have their own identity\u2026They don\u2019t know about their parentage.\u201d",

        "Despite a 33-25 win in Bledisloe I, the All Blacks were put through an unflattering review on Monday, where players were held accountable for their mistakes.\nHowever, Smith vowed the team's game managers wouldn\u2019t repeat their tactical errors in Bledisloe II at Eden Park on Saturday.\n\u201cWe had a plan around how we wanted to exit and get our forwards in the game early,\u201d Smith told The Breakdown on Sky on Monday evening.\n\u201cBut there was just so many opportunities.

The only reason we were under pressure was because we let them off the hook.\n\u201cWe were putting them under so much pressure at set-piece time, but we were unable to capitalise.\nSmith also had some advice for the younger players in squad: \u201cDon\u2019t jut read your good press.\u201d\nModern players \u2013 especially in Super Rugby and at the All Blacks level \u2013 face significant scrutiny, particularly as social media platforms give supporters direct and instant access to the players.",

This year, Trump and evangelicals top the list again, but now it's more about the Trump administration's support of evangelicals.\nThe list of top religion stories is decided by an annual poll of journalists in the Religion News Association and reported by the Religion News Service (RNS).\n\"They are strongly represented in President Trump's cabinet and religious advisory board and have shaped the administration's priorities ranging from Jerusalem to the Supreme Court to interpretations of religious liberty,\" RNS President Manya Brachear Pashman said of evangelicals.\nGod and Donald Trump author Stephen Strang pointed out when it comes to evangelicals, \"A large majority are still aligned with the unconventional president, thanks in part to the fulfillment of the promises he made to Christians around the country, such as strengthening religious liberties protections, appointing a conservative jurist to the Supreme Court, supporting pastors and churches, and keeping the American family a priority.\"\n\"These so-called \"Trumpvangelicals\" are enjoying unprecedented access to the Oval Office both through Vice President Mike Pence, a conservative Christian, and an informal advisory panel consisting almost entirely of conservative evangelical Christian leaders,\" Pashman said.\nAlso in the top 10 religion stories of the year:\nWhite supremacists march in Charlottesville, Va. \u2014 Neo-Nazis carrying anti-Semitic slogans on some of their signs were resisted by several religious groups.\nThe Muslim travel ban \u2014 the Trump administration says trying to lessen the chance of terrorists entering the U.S., but some considered the so-called 'Muslim travel ban' anti-Islamic.\nJerusalem \u2014 Trump officially recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital, garnering much praise from many Jewish leaders and Israel-backers. But critics blasted the decision and 128 nations in the U.N. General Assembly voted to declare Trump's action \"null and void.\"\nAtrocities against the Rohingya \u2014 the Buddhist majority in Myanmar persecutes its Muslim Rohingya minority and chases more than 500,000 of them out of the country.\nSutherland Springs church shooting \u2014 the deadliest mass shooting ever in Texas, killing 26 parishioners.\nJudge Roy Moore's U.S. Senate run.\nThe choosing of Neil Gorsuch and other conservative judicial nominees.\nNational Football League players protesting during the playing of the National Anthem and the backlash from many NFL fans and viewers.\nThe Protest Reformation's 500th anniversary.\nIt didn't make the top 10, but taking the number 11 spot was the Masterpiece Cakeshop case that ended up putting the question of religious liberty once again before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nAs for Trump, he was anointed Religion Newsmaker of the Year, beating out Pope Francis, Martin Luther and Judge Roy Moore for the title.\nStrang \u2014 himself a charismatic evangelical \u2014 pointed out many evangelicals during last year's presidential campaign opposed candidate Trump.

With United's badge on his chest, Pogba won the EFL Cup and the UEFA Europa League under the tutelage of Jose Mourinho. There's no doubt that Pogba is a world-class talent, though he was criticised several times by the former United boss.\nStatistically, Pogba has been enduring one of his best seasons for the Premier League side. Having scored 15 goals and provided 9 assists, Pogba has proved his class this season.\nReal Madrid, who have endured a dreadful season, want to launch the midfielder as quickly as possible. Los Blancos' current coach Zinedine Zidane is going to revamp his squad during the approaching transfer window as a few big names are on the club's radar.\nAs per rumours, Real Madrid wants to pay less salary than what Pogba is getting from his current club.\nThe heart of the matter\nReports from L'Equipe (via English publication) has claimed that United are chasing Adrien Rabiot, who will become a free agent at the end of this current season.\nUnder the management of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Pogba has played the pivotal role for Manchester United and it is expected that a top-class player like Rabiot would be an appropriate replacement for the 24-year-old World Cup winner.\nRabiot is currently playing for Paris Saint-Germain. The 2018-19 season has been a disgraceful one for the French midfielder as he has made only 14 appearances for the club.",

This is his grassroots effort to promote civility in discussion and debate. The larger plan is to form approximately 10 to 12 person groups and talk politics and beyond.\nBentson created his Neighbor to Neighbor (N2N) initiative to provide for people who self-identify as conservatives and liberals, Democrats or Republicans, with independents added to the mix when possible. He notes, \"N2N is not about persuasion or conversion to any particular political party or point of view. It is all about increasing your understanding of the reasons other people may not agree with you. If we can come to understand each other and talk to each other even though we disagree, then maybe we can reduce our current toxic level of political partisanship and find a way to work more effectively together to address the problems and challenges we all face.\"\nBentson wants N2N to be a way to share your thoughts and feelings while also making a sincere effort to understand the thoughts and feelings of your neighbors. Whether you are liberal, moderate or conservative, Republican, Independent or Democrat, you are invited to join your neighbors in a small group for civil political discussion.\nBentson needs people for these N2N groups and took to the streets downtown last week to hopefully engage in conversation, and ultimately recruit volunteers willing to participate in the groups.\nHe sat with his sign and cooler of water in Pioneer Park twice last week to kick off his campaign of civil and meaningful dialogue.

He was on his way to visit family and weld a kayak rack onto his vehicle.\nIt\u2019s a weird time to be traveling, but he\u2019s been hunkered down for months and had new songs to record. Though the year's been rough, it hasn't kept him from being productive.\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping my distance and wearing the mask and carrying the hand sanitizer,\u201d Rice says. \u201cEveryone in the studio was real good about that, too. We were all masked up and everything. I\u2019m just trying to make my way across the country as safe as I can.\u201d\nRice is excited that his second album, SAME SHIrT, DIFFERENT DAY, which premieres on streaming platforms on October 23, is starting to get some attention. It's listed as \u201cBubblin\u2019 Up\u201d on the Americana Music Association\u2019s album chart. The album offers twelve tracks of dirty, twangy country-soaked rock and a long list of guest musicians. Tracks take shots at the current presidential administration and the drag of working a corporate job.\nMarijuana Deals Near You\nIt\u2019s a follow up to Rice\u2019s 2014 debut, Empty Pockets and a Troubled Mind, and Rice felt more comfortable in the studio this time around. He also wrote the songs more quickly, inspired in part by the state of the world.\n\u201cI like the second one more,\u201d Rice says, adding that he likes both records. \u201cI think the songs are more recent and relevant. The first one had some of the first songs I had ever written, kind of through high school up through when I recorded it.

        "West Coast premiership big man Nathan Vardy appears to have won the race to partner Nic Naitanui in the ruck for round one of the AFL season, but Oscar Allen's role remains a mystery.\nNaitanui got through two-and-a-half quarters in Sunday's 10-point pre-season win over Fremantle, with the two-time All-Australian tallying 22 hit-outs from five possessions.\nIt was his one and only match of the pre-season after injuring his hamstring over the summer.\nThe return to full-length matches this year means West Coast want to give Naitanui more support in the ruck, and Vardy is almost certain to be given first crack.\nAllen was the go-to ruck support option last year for Naitanui, but the Eagles are keen to use a recognised ruckman like Vardy or Bailey Williams in the role in 2021.\nVardy didn't play a single AFL match last year, with his season heavily disrupted by a frightening case of compartment syndrome in his leg that resulted in him being rushed to hospital.\nWilliams is currently nursing an ankle injury, and Vardy's ability to get through two pre-season games has put him in the box seat to earn a round-one call-up for the clash with Gold Coast.\nDefender Harry Edwards is another option the Eagles will consider, but it's unlikely they will go with it just yet.\nAllen is a lock for round one - but his position on the field remains up in the air.\nThe 21-year-old has switched between attack and defence during the pre-season, and coach Adam Simpson says the expected availability of forward Josh Kennedy (calf) for round one could see Allen play more down back.\n\"We're playing with the idea,\" Simpson said.\n\"Especially when Josh comes back and there's some height in our front half and we can we mix it up a bit.\n\"It's not saying we're going to do it round one but it's an option for us, these are the games where you trial a couple of things.\n\"But he's a pretty good player wherever he plays.\"\nStar midfielder Tim Kelly missed both pre-season games with a thumb injury, but Simpson is confident the former Cat will be ready for round one.",

They had to get it to 53 players, but with two on the COVID list and at least one imminently returning, they left an open spot on the roster.\nThere will be other changes with waiver claims and free agents, but we know what the initial 53-man roster looks like.\nBelow, we go position by position to break down each group of players left.\nListen to the latest from Cards Wire\u2019s Jess Root on his podcast, Rise Up, See Red.

In today's NFL with the coronavirus still a concern, having three quarterbacks who can play in the offensive system is a necessity. It is simply a case of whether he is on the roster or the practice squad. And if they don't want to expose Streveler to waivers, then it makes sense to keep him on the roster. They have to have some inactive players on game days. It might as well be a quarterback. It is important to note that the team really likes Streveler.\nRunning back\nJoe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\nChase Edmonds, James Conner, Eno Benjamin, Jonathan Ward\nThere isn't anything surprising about this group. What we will need to see is if all four will be active for games and to see how the depth chart plays out. Is Benjamin or Ward the No. 3 running back?

Green, Christian Kirk, Rondale Moore, Andy Isabella, Antoine Wesley\nStory continues\nIt seemed like the Cardinals were always going to have six receivers on the roster. However, some doubted that Isabella would make the team, although those with strong connections with the organization suggested he was more or less a lock. KeeSean Johnson's release was a surprise, making Wesley's appearance surprising, especially when Greg Dortch was cut after looking good both in games and in camp. But Wesley offers length that no one else on the roster has. Keeping Dortch, who I would not be surprised to see on the practice squad, would have given the Cardinals three of the same type of receiver \u2014 short, quick and some return upside \u2014 with him, Isabella and the rookie Moore.\nTight end\nWilliams and Daniels were always going to be on the roster.

While technically a retreat, it in no way means Gomez is hiding her emotions from her fans; in fact, in publicly expressing her decisions to step back when she needs a moment to collect her thoughts, she in many ways is far more open than those celebs who tweet and post every thought that pops into their heads.

        "The Eighth Amendment has caused pregnant women with cancer to die and will continue to put them at risk if it is not repealed, an obstetrician has said.\nLouise Kenny, a professor of obstetrics and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said she had witnessed care being denied to a pregnant woman with cancer because of the State\u2019s abortion laws.\n\u201cIt is an outrageous lie to say that the Eighth has never changed medical management or adversely affected the outcome of a woman with cancer,\u201d said Prof Kenny, who specialises in the management of high risk pregnancies.\n\u201cIt is a fact that the Eighth Amendment casts a shadow over the care of every woman of reproductive age with complex medical needs in this State.\u201d\nProf Kenny was responding to an opinion article by Prof Eamon McGuinness which appeared in The Irish Times last week.\nIn his piece, Prof McGuinness said: \u201cFor example, a pro-choice meeting in Kildare was recently told that a woman who has cancer while pregnant cannot avail of chemotherapy in Ireland. This is simply false, and it appals me that such a claim would ever be made about our health service. Let there be no doubt: in such a situation, a woman can indeed be treated, even if the treatment leads to a detrimental outcome for the unborn child.\u201d\nThe suggestion that the Eighth Amendment, which guarantees an equal right to life to the mother and the unborn, does not put pregnant women\u2019s lives at risk is disingenuous, Prof Kenny said.\nShe was involved in the care of the late Michelle Harte, who had to travel to Britain for an abortion while terminally ill with cancer.",
        "Robert Lewandowski scored a second consecutive home hat-trick in the Bundesliga as 10-man Bayern Munich thrashed Stuttgart 4-0 to extend their lead at the summit to four points.\nThe Pole, who found the back of the net threes time against Borussia Dortmund on his last league outing at the Allianz Arena, took just 39 minutes to repeat the feat here.\nSerge Gnabry also got on the scoresheet in a rampant first half as Hansi Flick's side brushed off the early loss of Alphonso Davies to a red card to claim a thumping victory.\nDavies received his marching orders after VAR intervened to upgrade a yellow for his studs-up challenge on Wataru Endo.\nAfter surviving an early storm, Bayern went ahead through Lewandowski, who claimed second place in the Bundesliga's all-time top scorer charts outright by powering in Gnabry's low cross to bring up his 269th goal in the competition.\nTen men\nFour goals\nThree points\nClean sheet\nJob well done\n#FCBVfB 4-0 pic.twitter.com/fCxqUFC8a5 \u2014 FC Bayern English (@FCBayernEN) March 20, 2021\nProvider then turned goalscorer as Gnabry benefited from a slick exchange between Thomas Muller and Leroy Sane to finish a wonderful team goal.\nA minute later, Lewandowski's powerful header from Muller's right-wing cross had Bayern three ahead with barely a quarter of the game gone.\nAnd the prolific Pole had a hat-trick just before the break, pinching the ball inside the box and arrowing a left-footed finish into the bottom right-hand corner to make it three goals from three shots.\nBayern's number nine should have made it four just past the hour mark but miscued in uncharacteristic fashion after being picked out by Benjamin Pavard's low cross.\nBut that miss mattered little in the end as the champions saw out their win with little discomfort.\nWhat does it mean? History beckons for Lewandowski\nHaving already scored more Bundesliga hat-tricks than any other player in history, Lewandowski added a 13th here to extend his lead over Mario Gomez (10) to three.\nThe Pole is now on 35 league goals for the season and will surely have his sights set on breaking Gerd Muller's record of 40 in a single campaign in the German top-flight in the eight remaining games.\nIn fact, 'Der Bomber's' outright scoring record of 365 does not look out of reach for a player who is now on 271 and, at the age of 32, still looks to have plenty of years at the top level left in him.\nLewa stars for Bayern\nBayern had been up against it even prior to losing Davies, but the complexion game changed entirely when Lewandowski took his first goal in brilliant fashion.\nThat the Poland international grabbed his hat-trick from just three shots says everything about his quality in front of goal.",

        "Back in 2016, Level-5 had quite a few mobile-related announcements. One of them was a smartphone port of the original Yo-kai Watch monster collecting RPG. Yo-kai Watch debuted on Nintendo 3DS in 2013 in Japan and it only saw a global release in 2015 through Nintendo. Following that, Yo-kai Watch 2 exploded in popularity but that was basically the peak for the franchise with it being nearly forgotten now (sadly). I enjoyed Yo-kai Watch on 3DS a lot but the second game was superb. The Yo-kai Watch anime even saw a global release with dubs back then. Following the 2016 announcement, Yo-kai Watch never made it to mobile but it did get a Nintendo Switch port that I bought from the Japanese eShop. It was a good conversion but obviously didn\u2019t include English. Check out the original 2016 smartphone trailer here Today, Level-5 revealed that the iOS and Android version of Yo-kai Watch is finally arriving tomorrow in Japan as a premium release.

        "El Cerrito, CA -- (ReleaseWire) -- 12/08/2014 --Oakland, California cosmetic surgeon Dr. Gabriel H. Patino provides skilled hair transplantation procedures for clients in Oakland, Berkeley, and surrounding areas of California at his practice, the Cosmetic Surgical Center of El Cerrito. Millions of Americans suffer from hair loss and may not know that there are many varieties of treatment available. The most effective solutions will be provided by a surgeon like Dr. Gabriel Patino, who is an experienced hair loss surgeon.\nHair transplant surgery provides immediate, visible results. During the procedure, hair is taken from an area of abundance on the head and replaced in the areas where hair loss has occurred. Up to 95% of transplanted hairs will remain alive and continue to grow and thicken. Since transplants will not prevent future hair loss or reverse the process of hair loss, Dr. Patino commonly suggests both hair transplant surgery and a regimen of Propecia. Some clients who are averse to taking prescription medication may benefit from a topical solution instead. Dr. Patino of the Cosmetic Surgical Center of El Cerrito specializes in a wide variety of advanced surgical and non-surgical cosmetic solutions, skin rejuvenation and hair restoration, helping clients achieve healthy, youthful, natural results.\nAbout The Cosmetic Surgical Center of El Cerrito\nThe Cosmetic Surgical Center of El Cerrito can treat current hair loss and help prevent future hair loss with the application of advanced techniques and technology. Dr. Patino and his team work closely with each client to provide specific treatment options best suited for their needs. Though over-the-counter solutions are available, including topical products like Minoxidil, that boast FDA approval, the results of such products can be unclear and widely varied. The medication in retail treatments is weaker than that found in prescription treatments, and the application process is messy, inconsistent and demanding. Certain orally taken medications like Propecia and Finasteride effectively reduce dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a testosterone byproduct that causes hair loss, and results are less noticeable than those of skilled hair transplant surgery.\nTo learn more, visit them online at http://www.thecosmeticsurgicalcenter.com",

REUTERS/Nacho Doce/Files\nSAO PAULO/BRASILIA A global conference in Brazil on the future of the Internet in the wake of U.S. spying revelations might be much less anti-American than first thought after Washington said it was willing to loosen its control over the Web.\nBowing to the demands of Brazil and other nations following revelations last year of its massive electronic surveillance of Internet users, the United States has agreed to relinquish oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned of Names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit group based in California that assigns Internet domain names or addresses.\n\"The focus has changed from a political reaction to the NSA allegations to one of more constructive criticism and talk about the future of the Internet,\" said William Beer, a cyber security expert based in Sao Paulo.\nThe two-day Net Mundial conference in Sao Paulo, which will be opened on Wednesday by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, will discuss cyber security and how to safeguard privacy and freedom of expression on the Internet, as well as the shape of a future international body to oversee the decentralized digital network.\nOfficials from dozens of countries - from China and Cuba to the United States and European nations - will attend, but organizers say they will have no more voice at the event than Internet companies, academics, technical experts and groups representing Internet users.\n\"All of them should have equal participation in this multi stakeholder process,\" said Virgilio Almeida, Brazil's secretary for IT policy, who will chair the conference.\nThe event is not expected to result in any binding policy decisions, but Almeida said it will launch a high-profile debate that will \"sow the seeds\" for future reforms of the way the Internet is governed.\nRousseff was infuriated by revelations last year that the U.S. National Security Agency snooped on her personal emails and telephone calls with secret Internet surveillance programs. Other leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel, were also targeted by the NSA surveillance.\nThe revelations by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden brought worldwide calls for the United States to reduce its control of the Internet, created 50 years ago to link the computers of American universities to the U.S. defense industry.\nLast month, the U.S. government surprised many by announcing it would relinquish oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned of Names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit group based in California that assigns the network's domain names or addresses.\nWashington said it will hand off control of ICANN by September 2015 to an international body to be decided upon over the next year, with one important caveat - the new organization cannot be controlled by any other government.",

I should have expected nothing less from Lena Dunham\u2019s series about a bunch of tremendously privileged white women in their late 20s, who seem to wade uncertainly through life utterly convinced that the world owed them something.\nDespite my reservations about the show, revolving around my inability to either relate to the characters or feel empathy towards them, because their lives are marked by dilemmas that are too first world, I have been a loyalist. Last week\u2019s episode amazed me. It was brilliantly written, impeccably enacted, and fabulously shot. Titled \u2018American Bitch\u2019, a play on the intended title of a Philip Roth novel, the episode evolves in the concentr\u00adated space of a lavish New York ap\u00adartment where a supposedly famous white American male novelist lives. Hannah has been invited by him so he can explain his side of the allegations made against him by a swarm of women whose claim is that he sexually manipulated them and took undue advantage of the power dyna\u00admic that marked their interactions with him. The bulk of the episode involves sophistry, where Chuck Pal\u00adm\u00ader, tries to convince Hannah he is the true victim. She doesn\u2019t buy into any of his arguments, but, soon enough, is shocked to realise he had been manipulating her all along.

Of course, then there is also the problem ofprocurement of raw materials increasingly rare and precious, from lithium to nickel, from cobalt to manganese, given the increase in global demand. However, recycling and the use of remanufactured batteries represent an increasingly realistic scenario. The Pnrr, which dedicates over 6 billion euros for infrastructures for sustainable mobility, reserves just one billion for the national battery, solar and wind power industry: a chapter they should fit into gigafactory projects, that is the accumulator factories for the propulsion of electric vehicles.\nSo, as the world runs, Italy risks being left behind. As usual. Yet something is also moving here. On the one hand, there is society Italvolt of the controversial Swedish manager Lars Carlstrom who promised to invest 4 billion on the site of the former Olivetti di Scarmagno, near Turin, for a plant, the first in Italy, which should reach 45Gwh and create 3,500 direct jobs, in addition to 10,000 of related industries. The start of construction of the gigafactory is scheduled for next year e battery production should start in 2024. Everything good? In short, there are some elements that cause perplexity. Italvolt, despite its name, is based both in Milan and in Coventry, in the north of England, but above all Carlstrom has a fairly talked about past behind him, with several entrepreneurial activities that ended badly and some legal proceedings for debts, even modest, not paid.\nOn the other side, everyone looks to Stellantis, our automotive giant that has decided to ride the turning point of the ecological transition. A few days ago, after a meeting at the Mise with the ministers Giancarlo Giorgetti and Andrea Orlando, the company has announced that it will also produce electric cars in Melfi, Basilicata, and that the activity of battery assembly.

She graduated from Santa Barbara High School in 1971. She married Phil Nelson in 1980 and they lived in Santa Barbara until 1996 before they moved to Lake Tahoe. Her time in Santa Barbara was spent enjoying the beach and time with her husband. Laurie had an engaging smile and loved to laugh. In Lake Tahoe she worked for Caesars for many years in hospitality, a job she thoroughly enjoyed. She loved to meet all the famous people who came through. She especially liked Red Skeleton who she escorted every time he did his show. Laurie got along with everyone. After Phil retired from the Forest Service, she and her husband grew tired of dealing with the snow. Phil and Laurie moved to Boise Idaho, where Phil took a job working for Hunot Retardant and where they purchased a quaint country home. With the help of her sister-in-law Dundie, Laurie learned how to create glass yard art and eventually started her own business. She was extremely proud of this new venture. Boise offered her and Phil wonderful night life experiences, bike riding along the green belt and taking walks with their pugs. Especially Laurie's pug Cricket, who hung in there along with Laurie to the end.

        "ROCHESTER HILLS, Mich. (AP) \u2014 On Monday, Dec. 13, a judge declined the request to move Ethan Crumbley, the 15-year-old charged with killing four students and injuring others in a shooting at Oxford High School, out of an adult jail.\nDuring his probable cause conference, Crumbley\u2019s attorney, Paulette Loftin, argued that he should be moved back to a juvenile facility, saying \u201che should not be considered a menace to other juveniles.\u201d\n\u201cThis is someone who has never been in trouble before,\u201d Loftin said. \u201cThis is not someone who has a history of assaulting kids his age or any other negative contact with his peers. This one isolated incident is all that we\u2019re looking at here today.\u201d\nBut District Judge Nancy Carniak sided with Assistant Oakland County Prosecutor Marc Keast, who countered that the nature of the charges and security risks mandate that Crumbley be held in an adult facility. Crumbley is charged as an adult with killing four classmates and injuring seven other people in the Nov. 30 shooting at Oxford High School, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit.\n\u201cThis cannot be compared to any other case that this court or any other court in this county has seen before, and calling this an isolated incident quite frankly does not do it justice,\u201d Keast said. \u201cThis was a mass murder at a school, judge. This was planned. It was pre-meditated. The defendant didn\u2019t just attack other individuals; he targeted juveniles.\u201d\nKeast said he would contact the jail after Monday\u2019s hearing and \u201cmake sure that the defendant is neither within sight nor sound of any adult at the jail.\u201d\nCarniak adjourned the probable cause hearing to Jan. 7 to review witness statements and other evidence from prosecutors and investigators. At that time, she could decide whether to order a competency exam if his attorneys request such an exam.\nMonday\u2019s conference was a procedural hearing to prepare for a Dec. 20 preliminary hearing, which also will be moved to a later date.\nCrumbley\u2019s parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, also being held at the jail, are accused of failing to intervene on the day of the tragedy and are charged with involuntary manslaughter.",

        "Some 30 years ago, a scientist at the University of Colorado Denver suggested that heat from a mantle plume under Marie Byrd Land might explain regional volcanic activity and a topographic dome feature. Very recent seismic imaging has supported this concept. When H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Seroussi of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, first heard the idea, however, \"I thought it was crazy,\" she said. \"I didn't see how we could have that amount of heat and still have ice on top of it.\"\nA new NASA study adds evidence that a geothermal heat source called a mantle plume lies deep below Antarctica's Marie Byrd Land, explaining some of the melting that creates lakes and rivers under the ice sheet. Although the heat source isn't a new or increasing threat to the West Antarctic ice sheet, it may help explain why the ice sheet collapsed rapidly in an earlier era of rapid climate change, and why it is so unstable today.\nThe stability of an ice sheet is closely related to how much water lubricates it from below, allowing glaciers to slide more easily. Understanding the sources and future of the meltwater under West Antarctica is important for estimating the rate at which ice may be lost to the ocean in the future.\nAntarctica's bedrock is laced with rivers and lakes, the largest of which is the size of Lake Erie. Many lakes fill and drain rapidly, forcing the ice surface thousands of feet above them to rise and fall by as much as 20 feet (6 meters). The motion allows scientists to estimate where and how much water must exist at the base.\nWith few direct measurements existing from under the ice, Seroussi and Erik Ivins of JPL concluded the best way to study the mantle plume idea was by numerical modeling. They used the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), a numerical depiction of the physics of ice sheets developed by scientists at JPL and the University of California, Irvine. Seroussi enhanced the ISSM to capture natural sources of heating and heat transport from freezing, melting and liquid water; friction; and other processes.\nTo assure the model was realistic, the scientists drew on observations of changes in the altitude of the ice sheet surface made by NASA's IceSat satellite and airborne Operation IceBridge campaign. \"These place a powerful constraint on allowable melt rates\u2014the very thing we wanted to predict,\" Ivins said. Since the location and size of the possible mantle plume were unknown, they tested a full range of what was physically possible for multiple parameters, producing dozens of different simulations.\nThey found that the flux of energy from the mantle plume must be no more than 150 milliwatts per square meter. For comparison, in U.S. regions with no volcanic activity, the heat flux from Earth's mantle is 40 to 60 milliwatts. Under Yellowstone National Park\u2014a well-known geothermal hot spot\u2014the heat from below is about 200 milliwatts per square meter averaged over the entire park, though individual geothermal features such as geysers are much hotter.",
        "Historically, research on vaccines has been primarily focused on whether or not vaccination could generate neutralizing antibodies to protect against viral infections. This has not been the case with the COVID-19 vaccines. The global roll out of these vaccines has been in an unprecedented and accelerated manner and the short-term and long-term effects to the human pathophysiology of the human immune system has not been fully investigated according to scientists. The many consequences of which have been reported in the adverse events databases such as the UKs Yellow Card Scheme and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from the USA.\nThese sites highlight the thousands of life changing post-vaccination outcomes, including anaphylactic shocks, myocarditis and even death. The concerns over the alarming figures caused by an unnecessary vaccine have too often been dismissed as conspiracy theories. One new study supports many of these so-called theories also revealed consistent alterations in gene expression of many different immune cell types, which supports the first so called \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d that the vaccine does indeed alter our genes.\nCONSPIRACY THEORY 2 \u2013 IT\u2019S THE VACCINE THAT MAKES PEOPLE SICK\nThe study also supports the \u201cconspiracists\u201d in the theory that it is the vaccine that is making people ill. Although, according to the CDC, COVID-19 Vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Yet we are also advised that those who have been double vaccinated can still \u201ccatch\u201d COVID-19 and can also spread it. But is it a virus that they are catching? Scientists that have recently conducted this new study may have provided the answer to that question after finding similar changes in the vaccinated as has been observed in the symptoms of those deemed COVID-19 symptoms Source.\nThe scientists vaccinated healthy volunteers with a double dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero Cell) to enable their participation in antibody and neutralizing antibody testing, as well as detailed clinical laboratory measurements before and at different times after vaccination. They were surprised to observe that consistent Pathophysiological changes, as if these people had experienced symptoms said to be present in an infection with SARS-CoV-2. For example:\nAs a result of these same symptoms being found in healthy volunteers post vaccination, it would suggest that the vaccination is mimicking infection.

        "A controversial facial recognition system to help the police catch criminals risks damaging public trust and could even be unlawful, a watchdog has warned.\nElizabeth Denham, the independent Information Commissioner, said the software, which scans crowds for a \u2018match\u2019 on a database of possible offenders, could be \u2018particularly intrusive\u2019.\nShe spoke out as a damning report into automated facial recognition technology (FRT), used in conjunction with CCTV cameras, found it was \u2018almost entirely inaccurate\u2019.\nMiss Denham said there was a \u2018real risk\u2019 that the public safety benefits of the state-of-the-art technology would be lost. She also announced a separate investigation into the \u2018proportionality\u2019 of police forces holding more than 19million mugshots.\nKnown as custody images, they are taken at police stations of people who are arrested or questioned \u2013 but the database includes hundreds of thousands of innocent people.\nFacial recognition software used by the police has captured the faces of innocent people and held them on file, according to a watchdog\nFacial recognition technology (FRT) has been used to compare faces with people on police wanted lists\nFrontline officers use the software to scan crowds at major events such as the Notting Hill Carnival, sporting fixtures, music concerts, festivals or at shopping centres.\nPhotographs and video footage can then be checked in real time against specially created watch-lists or a database of custody images to see if there is a match.\nBut a study by civil liberties campaigners found that a staggering 98 per cent of \u2018matches\u2019 by one of three police forces who have used the technology were wrong.\nIt means thousands of innocent people are stopped by police, arrested or asked to prove their identities.\nIt is leading to concerns that Britain is sleepwalking into a surveillance state, says Big Brother Watch. In a blog posted yesterday, Miss Denham said: \u2018There may be significant public safety benefits from using FRT \u2013 to enable the police to apprehend offenders and prevent crimes from occurring.\n\u2018But how facial recognition technology is used in public spaces can be particularly intrusive.

        "LONDON: The United Kingdom has announced to impose its strictest travel curbs on India after an explosion of coronavirus cases in the country. The announcement was made on Monday, shortly after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called off a scheduled trip to New Delhi.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said that it will be effective from 0300 GMT on Friday, India will be added to Britain's \"red list\" of countries, banning all arrivals from India except for the UK or Irish nationals.\n\"We\u2019ve made the difficult but vital decision to add India to the Red List. This means anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident, or a British citizen cannot enter the UK if they`ve been in India in the previous 10 days,\" Matt Hancock told Parliament.\n\"UK and Irish residents and British citizens who`ve been in India in the past 10 days before their arrival will need to complete hotel quarantine for 10 days from the time of arrival.\"\nThe move was taken as a precaution while the COVID-19 variant first identified in India was assessed. Asked whether vaccines being rolled out in Britain worked against the variant, Hancock said he could not give that assurance but was looking to establish an answer as soon as possible.\n\"The core of my concern about the variant first found in India is that the vaccines may be less effective in terms of transmission and/or in terms of reducing hospitalisation and death,\" he said. \"It is the same concern that we have with the variant first found in South Africa, and is the core reason why we took the decision today.\"\nEarlier, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cancelled his planned visit to India next week due to the coronavirus situation there.\nJohnson, who admitted it was 'frustrating' but 'only sensible' to call off the visit, will instead speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this month to launch their plans for the future UK-India partnership, with their physical meeting expected later in the year.\n\"Narendra Modi and I have basically come to the conclusion that, very sadly, I won't be able to go ahead with the trip,\" Johnson told reporters, during a visit to Gloucestershire soon after the Downing Street announcement.\n\"I do think it's only sensible to postpone, given what's happened in India, the shape of the pandemic there.",

        "ROUND ROCK \u2014 Barring a complete meltdown in the final days of the season, the Round Rock Express are playoff bound next week.\nBy winning the first two games of their showdown series against San Antonio, the Express (81-53) have the Missions (78-56) on the ropes. Round Rock's magic number for winning its division was four entering Wednesday night.\n\"I'm confident in my team, but not comfortable,\" manager Mickey Storey said. \"Sure, I like our position. A lot of things can still happen, though. Until you've slammed the door shut, it's still open a crack.\"\nThe Express, with the best record in the Pacific Coast League, are confident enough to be printing \u2014 and selling \u2014 playoff tickets. A best-of-five semifinal series against the Iowa Cubs (71-63) would begin with games 1 and 2 at Dell Diamond next Wednesday and Thursday (Sept. 5) nights. The series would move to Des Moines for the weekend.\nRound Rock won't have its marquee player for the postseason as the Houston Astros revealed they will promote left fielder Kyle Tucker once major league rosters are expanded next week.\nTucker was voted to the All-PCL Team just days after becoming the fifth player in the 116-year history of the league to record a 30-home run/30-stolen base season. Houston's No. 1 prospect leads the Express in home runs (32), RBIs (94), runs (89) and steals (30), among other categories.\nFirst, Tucker and his team have a bit more business to handle. If Round Rock doesn't clinch in its home finale Thursday, it will have ample opportunity in a season-ending series this Labor Day weekend at Omaha (57-76), which owns the worst record in the PCL.\nThe Express' 6-0 and 4-3 wins Monday and Tuesday, fueled by shutout pitching from Jose Urquidy and Kent Emanuel and big hits from Chas McCormick, put the Missons in an almost untenable position. Round Rock clinched the season series 9-5, taking home the first-ever I-35 Traffic Cone trophy. The first division tiebreaker is head-to-head, giving the Express an important cushion should the teams finish with the same record.\n\"So essentially we're up by one more game, four with six left,\" said Emanuel, who was immaculate Tuesday night.\nThe former North Carolina Tar Heels left-hander, who pitched against Texas in the 2011 College World Series, stifled the Missions with a one-hit shutout over eight innings with no walks and six strikeouts. After allowing a single to Travis Shaw to open the second inning, Emanuel retired 21 batters in a row.\n\"I'm not a guy who throws 100 mph, so staying in the zone and getting ahead in counts are very important to my success,\" he said.\nEmanuel is a major reason why the Express, who trailed the Missions for most of the season, caught and passed them this month.",

        "You probably know Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler, the de facto leader of the band of kids battling Demogorgons and Demodogs on Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things.

Most of the four young musicians have been playing together for years, since before Wolfhard became a semi-household name. And he\u2019s at least as passionate about music as he is about acting, citing contemporary acts like Grizzly Bear, Mac DeMarco, Ariel Pink, Foxygen, and Twin Peaks as influences alongside classics like the Beatles, the Cars, the Velvet Underground, and the Modern Lovers.\nWhat Wolfhard\u2019s big break acting on Stranger Things has afforded him is a chance to actually meet some of his musical idols. After learning he was a fan, Wolfhard\u2019s older Stranger Things castmate Joe Keery, aka Steve Harrington, offered to introduce him to Twin Peaks frontman Cadien Lake James. And as a result of that introduction, James ended up producing Calpurnia\u2019s entire six-track debut EP, Scout, at Twin Peaks\u2019 studio in Chicago.\nCalpurnia have already shared three tracks, City Boy,\u201d \u201cLouie,\u201d and \u201cGreyhound,\u201d from the upcoming EP. The full collection comes out this Friday, 6/15, on Royal Mountain Records, the same label that releases music by PUP and Mac DeMarco. But before that happens, Stereogum gave Wolfhard a chance to talk about the EP with another one of his longtime musical idols: Grizzly Bear frontman Ed Droste.\nWolfhard took some time out of his busy day of attending school and being on set to chat with Droste on the phone, discussing their respective bands\u2019 creative processes, what he\u2019s listening to, and his experience as both an actor and a working musician.

        "Photo : KBS News\nChina has made clear of its willingness to participate in the signing of a declaration that would formally end the Korean War, according to a senior government official in Seoul.The unnamed official told Yonhap News Agency on Monday that Beijing believes that it should participate in the declaration as a signatory of the 1953 Armistice Agreement.The official said the concerned parties - the two Koreas, the U.S. and China - would need to consult on the details of the declaration.Beijing reportedly considers the war-end declaration as a step towards signing a peace agreement with North Korea, in contrast to Seoul and Washington viewing it more as a political and symbolic gesture for trust-building with Pyongyang.The future of related discussions will likely depend on how much Beijing will see eye-to-eye with Seoul and Washington's positions.",

        "Columbia reaches historical high for nuclear generation\nRICHLAND, Wash., Jan. 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Columbia Generating Station produced more clean, nuclear energy for the Northwest power grid during 2018 than any other year in its 34-year history. Columbia sent more than 9.7 million megawatt-hours of electricity to the grid, surpassing the previous generation record set in 2016 (9.6 million MWhrs). Columbia has set new generation records five out of the last seven years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about mitigating climate change one clean megawatt at a time, while providing 24/7, low-cost electricity throughout the Northwest,\u201d said Energy Northwest CEO Brad Sawatzke. \u201cOur team\u2019s doing an outstanding job increasing nuclear performance, which continues to lower the cost of our electric bills.\u201d\nAt a five-year average of 7.25 cents per kilowatt-hour, Washington state has the lowest cost of retail electricity in the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nEnergy Northwest estimates Columbia\u2019s cost of power will average 4.2 cents per kilowatt-hour during its 2018-2019 fuel cycle, down from 6.3 cents, adjusted for inflation, during its 2010-2011 cycle. Columbia refuels every two years, resulting in higher cost of power during refueling years and lower cost during non-refueling, full-run years.

Columbia now has an output of 1,207 megawatts (gross), or enough clean energy to power Seattle and part of its metro area.\nSince 2012 Columbia performed at an average capacity factor of 92 percent.

        "Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe is suing the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), alleging they refused to provide him with documents related to his firing. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March, just two days before he was set to retire.\nThe complaint says the DOJ has publicly defended the firing yet failed to identify for McCabe the policies and procedures it followed before dismissing him. The department has withheld the information, McCabe's lawyers allege, for fear that the materials could be used against them in any additional lawsuits.\n\"We don't create or adjudicate under secret law or procedure,\" David Snyder, one of McCabe's lawyers, said in an email to The Associated Press.\nThe case pits the career law enforcement official against a Justice Department that employed him for more than two decades. It refocuses attention on a firing last March that divided current and former DOJ officials. And it signals that McCabe, repeatedly targeted for criticism and attacks by President Trump in the last year, is determined to try to clear his name in court even as he faces a possible criminal probe into whether he intentionally misled internal investigators.\nThe lawsuit in federal court in Washington also comes just days ahead of a Justice Department inspector general report expected to criticize senior FBI officials, including McCabe, for their actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\nMcCabe's lawyers say in the complaint that they want the records as they \"seek to vindicate Mr. McCabe's rights and restore his good name,\" and as they weigh whether to take more legal action over a firing they contend was improper. The case names as defendants the Justice Department, the FBI and the inspector general's office.\nA spokeswoman for DOJ declined to comment Tuesday evening, and a spokesman for the watchdog office did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe on March 16, less than two days before his scheduled retirement, on the recommendation of FBI and DOJ officials. McCabe, who joined the FBI in 1996 and was named to the No. 2 position 20 years later, became the bureau's acting leader following the firing in May 2017 of James Comey as director.\nThe termination followed allegations that McCabe had misled disciplinary officials and Comey, his then-boss, about his role in authorizing FBI officials to speak with a Wall Street Journal reporter for an October 2016 story about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\nThe inspector general's office concluded in a report earlier this year that McCabe had repeatedly deceived investigators and referred the matter for potential criminal prosecution to the U.S. attorney's office in Washington. McCabe has denied the allegations, and has said that when he thought his answers were being misunderstood during interviews with investigators, he tried to correct the record.\nIn the lawsuit, McCabe's lawyers say the department has repeatedly insisted that it followed appropriate policies and procedures before firing McCabe but has either denied or refused to respond to multiple requests about that process.\n\"Defendants fear that disclosure to Plaintiff of the documents at issue will place Defendants and others at risk in any proceedings brought against them by Mr. McCabe,\" the complaint states. \"Based on these fears, Defendants appear to have preemptively decided not to disclose the documents to Plaintiff.\"\nAmong the records being sought are an inspector general manual that lays out the guidelines governing the office and FBI policy guides on how disciplinary matters should be handled.\nThe lawsuit says the inspector general's office refused to make the manual available for public review and denied multiple requests to provide it, and also denied the lawyers access to a library or reading room where the materials could have been reviewed.",
        "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Seven Hong Kong pro-democracy activists pleaded guilty Thursday to organizing and inciting others to take part in an unauthorized assembly held in 2019, local media reported.\nThe seven activists appearing in court included Raphael Wong, the former chairman of the League of Social Democrats political party, and Figo Chan, who led the Civil Human Rights Front, a now disbanded group that organized protests.\n\u201cI was protesting based on the principle of civil disobedience. One of the key elements of civil disobedience is to accept the charges. So that is what we are going to do later, to plead guilty,\u201d Wong said Thursday ahead of the proceedings.\n\u201cAnother key element is that the people carrying out civil disobedience actions know being jailed is just part of the process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not worried about being jailed. Instead, we hope we can achieve democracy after this process.\u201d\nLocal news outlets Ming Pao and Stand News later reported all seven pleaded guilty. Lawyers for the defendants could not be reached for comment and calls to the court went unanswered.\nThe activists are the latest to appear in court for charges related to 2019 antigovernment protests that roiled the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The protests were sparked by concerns that Beijing was infringing on the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it was handed to Chinese control in 1997.\nBeijing responded to the protests by imposing a strict new national security law last year that has effectively criminalized much of the opposition to the government and silenced dissent.\nMost of the city\u2019s most prominent activists, including Joshua Wong and Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai, are currently behind bars. Many of them were prosecuted for taking part in unauthorized protests in 2019.\nOf the seven defendants on Thursday, only Wong was not held in custody prior to appearing in court.",

        "If you spend hours working at your desk or playing games, you need a supportive chair to prevent back and neck pain.\nIncorrect posture can lead to poor circulation and unnecessary fatigue. It can even affect your mood and contribute to stress. The right gaming chair can help alleviate these issues.\nThere are a few things to look out for when selecting a gaming chair for back pain. Everyone\u2019s needs are different, so it\u2019s important to choose a chair with features that best suit you. Chairs that feature an adjustable back with lumbar and neck support are especially desirable due to their high level of adjustability. Some gaming chairs have ergonomic shapes that encourage you to sit up straight instead of slouching. A gaming chair that eases back pain should also have firm but ample padding. A tall backrest can also reduce slouching because they provide extra neck support that\u2019s not found on shorter office chairs.\nOther features to look out for if you want to prevent back pain are a reclining function and removable pillows. Being able to recline allows your body to stretch and find the perfect position to get you the support you need. Included pillows can provide additional neck and lumbar support.\nMoving from a conventional office chair to a gaming chair might be a bit difficult at first because your body has to get used to the new seating position. It shouldn\u2019t take long to adjust to the new position, and you\u2019ll likely know if the chair is right for your back within a week.\nHere are some of the best gaming chairs for back pain.\nVertagear SL5000\nImage by Vertagear via Amazon\nThe Vertagear SL5000 is a racing-style seat favored by gamers for its immense comfort. The high backrest provides excellent support, and it also has a dual-vent system to keep you cool. Both the seat and backrest also have side supports to keep you snug in your seat. This Vertagear chair is upholstered with polyurethane (PU) leather that\u2019s easy to clean.\nThe SL5000 gives users easily adjustable comfort features. These features include removable memory foam pillows that provide neck and lumbar support. Another feature that can help to ease back pain is the adjustable backrest. It can recline between 80 and 140 degrees so that you can find the most comfortable position.\nThis chair also has the usual features associated with gaming chairs, like adjustable height, four-direction armrests, and a tilt and locking mechanism.",

        "Brittney Lofthouse \u2013 Contributing Writer\nIt has been nearly a year since counties across WNC received nearly $10 million in state grant funding to boost rural broadband connectivity. With public education in North Carolina shifting to at-home distance learning amid the COVID-19 outbreak and businesses across the state being ordered to allow employees to work from home wherever possible, the need for broadband is greater than ever.\nIn May 2019, North Carolina issued the Growing Rural Economies with Access to Technology (GREAT) grant. The matching grants went to \u201cInternet service providers and electric membership cooperatives that compete for funding to lower financial barriers that prevent high speed internet service expansion in Tier 1 \u2013 which is identified as economically distressed counties,\u201d according to Gov. Roy Cooper and the NC Department of Information Technology.\nLaunched by the N.C. General Assembly in 2018, the program subsidizes Internet providers and electric cooperatives who are working with unserved and underserved rural communities across the state.\n\u201cAccess to reliable, high-speed internet service is critical for businesses to grow, students to learn, and communities to thrive,\u201d Cooper said in announcing the funding. \u201cThese grants will help connect thousands of homes and businesses with opportunities across the state and around the world.\u201d\nThe grants went to assist 14 companies \u2013 including Morris Broadband which serves Macon County \u2013 improve broadband for some 10,000 households plus almost 600 businesses and community institutions.\n\u201cThe construction process began the last quarter of 2019,\u201d said Morris Broadband General Manager Tony Carter. \u201cThat involved engineering design, pole permits and pole replacements and other make-ready preparations. Those have all been filed and are just awaiting a few more responses and replacements until we can begin construction.\u201d\nCarter said the company is now switching its focus to the physical construction of the expansion project, which will begin within the next few weeks.\n\u201cWe anticipate the physical, visible construction to begin sometime in April,\u201d said Carter. \u201cAll expansions we have on our plate have always been considered an urgency as all of them involve under-served areas and will continue to be a top priority for us.\u201d\nThe Morris expansion will ideally provide internet access to 226 homes within Macon County. The project was estimated to cost $667,000 which included $433,550 in state grant money along with a $233,450 investment from Morris.\nMorris Broadband currently provides just under 3,500 residences in Macon County with internet services.

(Photo by Jeremy Daniel)\nOnly three months after late activist Edith Windsor\u2019s 2013 victory for gay rights at the Supreme Court, which led to the national legalization of same-sex marriage, The New York Times ran an article questioning the resolve of queer theatres to evolve with the times.\n\u201cAt a time of rapid change in the gay-rights movement, from marriage to the military, the purpose of a strictly gay theatre company isn\u2019t the same as it was 10 years ago,\u201d remarked Times contributor Erik Piepenburg. The writer observed a general decline in interest for LGBTQ topics and a subsequent drop at gay-specific companies in both revenues and taste. The logical result? Queer theatre companies were opting for lighter, campier fare, Piepenburg wrote, to keep their audiences happy.\nUnderlying this high-profile conclusion is the anxiety that queer theatre cannot survive the shifting tides of public opinion. Without antipathy, is there just apathy? Without something to fight against, does the once edgy avant-garde of queer theatre disappear?\nElsewhere, critics have eviscerated a handful of once-classic gay works as shallow, dated excursions.

        "If you're struggling on what to have for dinner Tuesday night, why not make it a pizza and help with the eradication of polio?\nThe Rotary Club of LaSalle Centennial is teaming up with local pizza shops for the annual Pizza for Polio fundraiser.\nAll day Tuesday, more than a dozen pizzerias across Windsor-Essex will be donating a portion of their proceeds to Rotary International's Global Polio Eradication Initiative.\nCoordinator Mary Lou Amlin says it's as easy as ordering a pizza.\n\"That money will go to help eradicate polio worldwide which is something that Rotary has been working on since 1988. At this time, we only have two countries left in the world that have any polio in them. Those are Afghanistan and Pakistan.\"\nShe says the world is nearly polio free.\n\"As Rotarians we say we're 99% there trying to eradicate polio.

        "Sports News of Thursday, 14 September 2017\nSource: Kwes\u00e9ESPN\n2017-09-14\nThe likes of Weah, Eto\u2019o, Drogba, Kuffour, Keita, Toure put Africa on the World map\nThe group stages of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League start this week, and Africa will again be well represented in both competitions.\nIt is a good time, therefore, for Kwes\u00e9ESPN to reflect on who have been Africa\u2019s top achievers in the European competitions, from most appearances and most goals, to other weird and wonderful records.\nMOST APPEARANCES IN UEFA CLUB FOOTBALL\n113 \u2013 SAMUEL ETO\u2019O (CAMEROON)\nPlayed for: Real Madrid, Mallorca, Barcelona, Internazionale, Anji, Chelsea, Everton\nNo African player has appeared in more UEFA club competition games than Eto\u2019o, who could conceivably still add to his tally as he is still playing in Turkey with Antalyaspor. Ironically, for a player so closely tied to Barcelona, he made his debut for Real Madrid and later featured in the Champions League with unfancied Mallorca. He lifted the elite competition title with Barca (twice) and Inter Milan, among a host of other honours in his stellar career.\n111 \u2013 SEYDOU KEITA (MALI)\nPlayed for: Marseille, Lens, Sevilla, Barcelona, Valencia, Roma\nKeita has most recently been playing in the Asian Champions League with Qatar side El-Jaish, but is best remembered for winning the European version twice with Barcelona. He also lifted the UEFA Super Cup with Sevilla and Barca, and in all represented six teams in UEFA club competitions. The dynamic midfielder pitched in with his fair share of goals overs the years as well, some of them crucial in bringing success to his teams.\n102 \u2013 DIDIER DROGBA (IVORY COAST)\nPlayed for: Marseille, Chelsea, Galatasaray\nDrogba is still playing in the USA for Phoenix Rising at the age of 39, but the chances of him ever adding to his tally of UEFA club competition appearances are virtually nil. Drogba enjoyed most of his trophy success at English giants Chelsea, where he spent nine seasons in two spells, including helping the London club to the Champions League trophy in the 2011/12 campaign. He also played for French side Marseille and Turkish outfit Galatasaray in European club competition.\n90 \u2013 SAMMY KUFFOUR (GHANA)\nPlayed for: Bayern Munich, Roma, Livorno\nDefender Kuffour is best known for his 12-year stay with German side Bayern Munich, where he won the Champions League in the 2000/01 season, having as finished runner-up two years before in THAT dramatic defeat to Manchester United. He also won six Bundesliga titles and was a hugely popular player at Bayern, before leaving for Italian side Roma in 2005. He later had a loan spell at Serie A side Livorno, who he represented in the now defunct UEFA Cup in the 2006/07 season.\n90 \u2013 KOLO TOURE (IVORY COAST)\nPlayed for: Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Celtic\nToure made the last of his 90 appearances just last season when he turned out for Glasgow Celtic against in a 2-0 loss to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, and has subsequently retired. Months before he had turned out for Liverpool in the UEFA Europa League final as they lost 3-1 to Spanish side Sevilla, meaning he would finish his career without a European club trophy. He also played for Arsenal in the Champions League decider in 2005/06, but they were beaten by Barcelona. Kolo\u2019s brother Yaya, who plays for Manchester City, is just four appearances behind him on the all-time African list.\nMOST GOALS IN UEFA CLUB FOOTBALL\n50 \u2013 DIDIER DROGBA (IVORY COAST)\nPlayed for: Marseille, Chelsea, Galatasaray\nDrogba is the only African player to score 50 goals in UEFA club competition, having averaged almost a goal every other game through his career. The vast majority came for Chelsea, but he netted five for Marseille and three for Galatasaray. His goal against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in 2012 is perhaps his most treasured as it secured a 1-1 draw, with The Blues winning on post-match penalties.\n48 \u2013 SAMUEL ETO\u2019O (CAMEROON)\nPlayed for: Real Madrid, Mallorca, Barcelona, Internazionale, Anji, Chelsea, Everton\nEto\u2019o will be hoping for one last season to be able to overhaul Drogba at the top of the list, but he needs to help current club Antalyaspor qualify for the UEFA club competitions first. His maiden goal in Europe came for Mallorca against Hajduk Split in 2001, and his last for Everton against FK Krasnodar in the Europa League in 2014.\n35 \u2013 GEORGE WEAH (LIBERIA)\nPlayed for: Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan\nWeah is regarded as arguably the greatest African footballer \u2014 certainly of the last three decades \u2014 and he was a prolific scorer for just about every side he played for. He failed to lift a European club trophy, but found plenty of domestic success with French Ligue 1 sides Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain, and Italian giants AC Milan. He was also a regular scorer for all three on the continent, later also playing for Chelsea, Manchester City and Marseille.\n32 \u2013 BENNI MCCARTHY (SOUTH AFRICA)\nPlayed for: Ajax Amsterdam, Celta Vigo, FC Porto, Blackburn Rovers\nMcCarthy memorably helped unfashionable FC Porto to the UEFA Champions League title under Jose Mourinho in 2004. His most famous goals came in the second round when he bagged a brace against Manchester United that set up a 3-2 aggregate win. McCarthy also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup with Spanish side Celta Vigo, and featured in European club competition with Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam and English side Blackburn Rovers.",
        "Our view of the soft sciences grows dimmer by the day, but it\u2019s good to know there are at least a few people involved with the discipline who haven\u2019t completely lost their minds. While most sociologists were quick to jump on the woke bandwagon (to the extent they weren\u2019t responsible for building that wagon in the first place), one professor at the University of Illinois is warning that today\u2019s tendency to smear everything and everyone as \u201cracist\u201d is having the opposite of its intended effect.\nIn an article for Persuasion, Professor Ilana Redstone said that using that term to describe everything that violates your political philosophy has robbed it of any meaning whatsoever.\n\u201cThe charge of racism can be reputation-destroying and have long-term psychological effects,\u201d Redstone wrote. \u201cYet its excessive application dilutes that power\u2014for example, applying the word \u2018racist\u2019 to both Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who murdered nine black worshippers at a South Carolina church in 2015, and a local-business promotion in Seattle involving decorative monkeys. The antiracist strategy is not only weakening its own best weapon, it\u2019s backfiring.\u201d\nRedstone went on to explain that one can support racial equality without buying into the woke, \u201cantiracist\u201d propaganda.\n\u201cThe argument of antiracist activists is that, if you stand against their methods, you oppose their ends, no matter how much you insist otherwise. Unsurprisingly, this has narrowed the spectrum of acceptable views on sensitive topics,\u201d she wrote. For example, opposition to affirmative action and support for increased border restrictions are two positions labeled racist under the expanded definition. Racial hostility is a possible motivation for those positions. After all, affirmative action was intended to benefit members of under-represented minorities; and much of the immigration to the West in the 21st century involves non-white migrants.\n\u201cBut one might have non-racist motives for such views, including concerns over whether affirmative action is the best way to help the targeted groups,\u201d she continued.",

        "NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bright Horizons Family Solutions\u00ae Inc. (NYSE: BFAM), a leading provider of high-quality education and care solutions designed to help employers support employees across life and career stages, today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2021.\nSecond Quarter 2021 Highlights (compared to second quarter 2020):\nRevenue of $441 million (increase of 50%)\nIncome from operations of $34 million (increase of 319%)\nNet income of $19 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.31 (increases of $18 million and $0.30, respectively)\nNon-GAAP measures\nAdjusted income from operations* of $34 million (increase of 25%)\nAdjusted EBITDA* of $68 million (increase of 13%)\nAdjusted net income* of $30 million and diluted adjusted earnings per common share* of $0.49 (increases of 13% and 11%, respectively)\n\u201c I am pleased to report another solid quarter across all of our services, as we continue to make good progress in returning our business to pre-COVID-19 levels,\u201d said Stephen Kramer, Chief Executive Officer. \u201c With full-time enrollment and back-up usage returning, and most centers re-opening by this fall, our recovery from the pandemic is on track. I continue to be inspired by our dedicated teachers and center operations leadership, who have been supporting children and families through these very challenging times, and likewise am proud of the strong client partnerships that have enabled the delivery of impactful solutions to families and learners over the past 18 months.\u201d\nSecond Quarter 2021 Results\nRevenue increased $147.7 million, or 50%, in the second quarter of 2021 from the second quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to enrollment increases in our open child care centers and the re-opening of our temporarily closed child care centers. While enrollment in our child care centers continued to improve during the quarter, our centers are still operating below pre-COVID-19 enrollment levels during this re-ramping phase. The increase in revenue in the full service center-based child care segment was partially offset by decreases in our back-up care services compared to the same period in the prior year. While we had gains from expanded back-up care client sales and increased utilization in traditional in-center and in-home care during the quarter, back-up care revenue decreased compared to the prior year as the second quarter in 2020 benefited from significant demand (primarily for self-sourced reimbursed care) during the early stages of the pandemic when other care alternatives were not available.\nIncome from operations was $34.0 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $8.1 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in income from operations reflects improved gross profit contributions in the full service center-based child care segment arising from higher enrollment as centers re-ramp and the re-opening of our temporarily closed centers, partially offset by reduced contributions from our back-up care services, which benefited in the second quarter of 2020 from increased demand during the early stages of the pandemic. Net income was $18.8 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $0.4 million in the same 2020 period, an increase of $18.4 million due to the increase in income from operations, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Diluted earnings per common share was $0.31 for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.01 for the second quarter of 2020.",
        "Daniel Houghton became the CEO of the popular travel publishing company, Lonely Planet, at just 24. The company wasn\u2019t adapting to modern times and its future looked bleak. They needed someone young, someone who knew how to transition Loney Planet into the digital age, and someone who understood both media and technology. That\u2019s when Houghton was tapped to lead the company. Under his leadership, the company modernized and developed a new generation of readers, and now has over 16.2 million followers on social media. Recently, Houghton stepped down as CEO and wrote the book Wherever You Go, which has just been released. I had the chance to sit down with him and ask about his time at Lonely Planet, his new book, and his future.\nYou became the CEO of Lonely Planet, one of the largest travel companies in the world, at just 24 years old. What was that like?\nWell\u2026 the company didn\u2019t exactly come with its own guidebook (laughs). It was really rough in the beginning. I come from a media background, but I had never had such responsibility before. It\u2019s a huge company, but luckily, they have such a great team and it really became a group effort. But yeah.. there was a very steep learning curve for sure.\nDid you enjoy your time there?\nOh, of course! I mean, it\u2019s such an amazing company, it has a huge dedicated fanbase around the world, and travel is something I\u2019m so passionate about. We hired people who loved the brand and loved travel, not people who were chasing money, and that made the entire company glow with such incredible energy.\nYou ended up stepping down from Lonely Planet, moved out to a farm in Tennessee and wrote a book. Explain how that happened.\nRunning a major company like Lonely Planet takes a lot out of you. It was an intense amount of travel and an intense amount of responsibility. We have a huge team that\u2019s spread out all over the world. I spent about 200-250 days per year on the road, which I absolutely loved and it was amazing, but it also has a way of wearing you out. By the end, after the company had made such growth, I felt that I had left my mark. I had made some really good things happen and it just felt like it was the right time to start a new journey.\nAnd unfortunately, then my dad got really sick, which I talk about in the forward of my book. So, I really wanted to be able to be close to my family. The farm thing came from me always wanting to live on a farm. I love woodworking, I love dogs, I love being outside, really, I just like a lot of old man things I guess! But yeah, with my dad being sick, I wanted some time off. I wanted to be with my family as much as I could. So now we all live in the same area and I can see them as much I want.\nHow about the book?",

Thailand, which has a knack for nabbing early wickets, was gifted one when Dane van Niekerk (2) patted Ratanporn Padunglerd\u2019s full toss to mid-on.\nLee, 10th in the ICC T20I batting rankings, dominated the scoring and slog swept Onnicha Kamchomphu for a 75-metre six. Thailand was forced to use seven different bowlers inside nine overs but none could withstand Lee's assault. She reached her 50 from 35 balls with a straight six.\nMATCH HIGHLIGHTS | Women's World T20, As it Happened: South Africa beats Thailand by 113 runs\n24-year-old Luus, featuring in her fourth women\u2019s T20 World Cup, then swung Chanida Sutthiruang\u2019s full toss for six over fine leg. Lee came in without a half-century in nine international innings but glided towards a century in 59 balls, showing her touch with a late cut for four before bringing up a ton fittingly with a four.\nImmediately after raising her bat to salute a jubilant South Africa dugout, she chipped a catch back to Suleeporn Laomi to end the partnership at 131.",

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\nMUMBAI England's humiliating series defeat in India painfully exposed an alarming paucity in the side's slow bowling options and drove home the fact they will continue to struggle in South Asia until they unearth some world class spinners.\nRetired off-spinner Graeme Swann had bemoaned England's indifferent approach towards slow bowling before the five-match series started and his fears were confirmed after the touring side were handed a 4-0 drubbing.\nThe alarm bells would have been ringing when England's spinners were out-bowled in Bangladesh in October, where the side lost their first ever test against the hosts in a series regarded by many as an appetiser for the Indian leg of the trip.\nThat 1-1 drawn series did little to prepare England's batsmen for the main course as India's spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin, the world's top-ranked test bowler, and Ravindra Jadeja helped themselves to 54 wickets.",

        "Caleres, Inc. (NYSE:CAL) is a stock to watch today. At current price of $5.53, the shares have already lost -1.46 points (-20.82% lower) from its previous close of $6.99. The stock sets an active trading volume day with a reported 145936 contracts so far this session. CAL shares had a relatively better volume day versus average trading capacity of 521.46 thousand shares, but with a 38.86 million float and a -26.42% run over a week, it\u2019s definitely worth keeping an eye on. The one year price forecast for CAL stock indicates that the average analyst price target is $20.67 per share. This means the stock has a potential increase of 273.78% from where the CAL share price has been trading recently.\nLooking at the current readings for Caleres, Inc., the two-week RSI stands at 10.09. This figure suggests that CAL stock, for now, is overbought, meaning that the shares are not stable in terms of price movement. The stochastic readings, on the other hand, based on the current CAL readings is similarly very revealing as it has a stochastic reading of 4.15% at this stage. This figure means that CAL share price today is being overbought.\nTechnical chart claims that Caleres, Inc. (CAL) would settle between $8.19/share to $9.39/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $6.34 mark, then the market for Caleres, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $5.7 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -1.7. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum.",
        "Fans of Dave Chappelle's Comedy Central series Chappelle's Show will be surprised if they go to watch the stand-up comedian's sketch show on Netflix tonight. Why? Because Chappelle's Show has been removed from the streaming platform. The comedy series was released on both Netflix (and HBO Max) on November 1 \u2014 a huge move for the comedian who has had a multi-special deal with the streamer for years. Chappelle even mentioned this big release event during his opening monologue while hosting the most recent episode of Saturday Night Live.\nBut things have taken a turn in the weeks since Chappelle's Show hit Netflix and HBO Max. On Tuesday, Chappelle uploaded a video to his Instagram titled \"Unforgiven.\" The 18-minute video appears to have been shot during a recent set of Chappelle's. Over the course of 18 minutes, Chappelle confirms he is the one who initiated the move to have Chappelle's Show removed from Netflix. He tied the show's removal from Netflix to ongoing issues with ViacomCBS and Comedy Central, who he claims did not pay him as part of the show's licensing contract.\nIn the video, Chappelle outlines his history of clashes with Viacom and why he left Chappelle's Show in 2005, saying, \"If you are streaming that show, you are fencing stolen goods. They stole that (show) from me, they just took it,\" later going on to say, \"I found out these people were streaming my work and never had to ask me or they never had to tell me. Perfectly legal because I signed the contract, but is that right? I didn\u2019t think so.\"\nImage via Netflix\nChappelle then offered thanks to Netflix for honoring his request to have the show removed, sharing with the audience, \"(Netflix) agreed that they would take it off their platform just so I could feel better. That\u2019s why I [work] with Netflix because they pay me my money, they do what they say they are going to do and they went above and beyond what you could expect from a businessman.\"\nThe veteran stand-up made an appeal to his audience in an effort to drive home his pain and disappointment with his treatment at the hands of Viacom: \"So I\u2019m not going to the agents, I\u2019m coming to my real boss \u2014 I\u2019m coming to you.

        "Forecast part of new Juniper and CLX Communications white paper - mapping the enterprise opportunity for CPaaS\n20th February 2018, London and Stockholm: CLX Communications AB (publ) - (XSTO: CLX) has today launched a new white paper in partnership with Juniper Research (https://www.juniperresearch.com/home) that forecasts that enterprise spend on Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) (http://www.clxcommunications.com) is set to quadruple by 2022 to $6.7bn.\nAccording to Juniper, the value of the CPaaS market grew by 50% to more than $1.6 billion in 2017. While early CPaaS adopters have primarily been agile, disruptive, digital-first players, this is beginning to change. More established businesses are now beginning to recognize the vital role that differentiation and personalization will play in attracting and retaining consumers, with customer engagement seen as a key future battleground.\nCPaaS is a cloud-based platform that enables businesses to quickly and easily integrate communications capabilities like voice, video, and messaging into their own applications, without needing to build backend infrastructure and interfaces. This enables them to add new capabilities such as chatbots, service agents and contact centers into their customer-facing applications with minimal effort.\nThe white paper, entitled 'Communications Platforms - Transforming Enterprises into Digital Innovators', provides an overview of the CPaaS market and its growth potential. In addition, the paper plots the journey from SaaS to PaaS and evidencing the effectiveness of CPaaS through various use cases.\nRobert Gerstmann, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer at CLX, commented, 'We live in a hyper-connected world where we routinely engage with our friends and family using a range of voice, video and messaging technologies. Therefore, as consumers we expect to be able to engage with our chosen brands and businesses whenever, and however we like.\n'CPaaS enables enterprises to rapidly innovate to meet consumer demand - making it easy to integrate a range of communications functions within their existing customer-facing apps and online systems.\n'As our white paper with Juniper illustrates - it's no longer just the native tech businesses that are innovating through CPaaS, many established multinationals are now waking-up to the importance of omnichannel communication for attracting and engaging the customer of tomorrow.'\nDr Windsor Holden, Head of Forecasting & Consultancy, Juniper Research, added: 'The rapid pace of technological change can be a problem for the most agile of enterprises. New technologies and devices in turn spawn new patterns of demand, meaning that keeping pace, let alone future-proofing, can be a challenge.\n'CPaaS offers a highly flexible solution which allows greater scalability, while reducing time-to implementation. Therefore, enterprises using CPaaS can continually evolve their customer engagement channels in line with consumer demand. This is why enterprise spend on CPaaS is set to surge in the next four years.'\nDownload the 'Communications Platforms - Transforming Enterprises into Digital Innovators' white paper from the CLX Communications website (https://www.clxcommunications.com/help/downloads-reports/) today.\nENDS\nFor CLX press enquiries, please contact:\nSteve Green - Giant PR\nMobile +44 (0) 7775677101\nEmail steve@giantpr.co.uk (mailto:steve@giantpr.co.uk)\nAbout CLX Communications\nCLX Communications (CLX) is a leading CPaaS provider to enterprises and mobile operators.

        "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is the best known of the cryptocurrencies, and it's seen a rapid increase in price since the virtual coin was introduced. Many prominent financial experts have endorsed investing some money in Bitcoin, including Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman.\nBut even if putting some money into Bitcoin could potentially be a valid investment approach, you definitely shouldn't make it the centerpiece of your retirement saving efforts. Here's why.\nYou need to diversify, even with Bitcoin\nBitcoin has seen explosive gains since the virtual coin was created, and there's definitely an argument to be made that you could make a lot of money by investing in it.\nBut the problem is that its real-world utility is still currently limited, and it has a relatively short track record compared to many other assets you could invest in. It's impossible to know what the future holds for Bitcoin. And with the coins only having value because people believe they do, there's a very real chance that an investment in Bitcoin could end up being a loser over the long term.\nWhile Bitcoin may be riskier than many other investments, such as index funds or stocks in established companies, that's not the only reason you shouldn't count on it to make you a retired millionaire. You shouldn't base your entire retirement portfolio around any single investment, whether Bitcoin or shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or even an S&P 500 index fund.\nThat's because putting all of your eggs in one basket is simply too risky when it comes to retirement. Retirees cannot live on Social Security alone as it is meant to replace just 40% of your pre-retirement earnings. You need to have a sizable nest egg to cover the necessities without a lot of financial struggle, so you need a retirement portfolio that doesn't expose you to too much risk.\nThe best way to build such a portfolio is to invest in a wide mix of assets, including stocks, bonds, index funds -- and cryptocurrencies, if you're interested in buying them.",
        "Anusha Ganapathi By\nExpress News Service\nCHENNAI: Inscryption is really a nerdy puzzle-based deck-building game. It is based off a simple boardgame mechanic, which works surprisingly well as a videogame. What reeled me in, is its lore and the very peculiar, nightmare-esque aesthetic. I am in a cabin, the door is locked. The room is cloaked in darkness, and I only see a table, dimly lit by cursed candles that indicate my fate. On the other end of the table is a bearded stranger, with skeletal fingers and bright eyes. He immerses me into the illusion he has woven.\nI am told that I am in a forest, in a caravan. The cards are my guardian creatures that help me struggle ahead. There are helpful witches, greedy hunters, and the occasional packrats. I must use the boons they give me to my advantage. I believe everything the stranger tells me. He challenges me to an insane card game. I must play, and I must win. Or I lose, and start from the beginning all over again.\nTo a person with no context, the cards would appear as though speaking a whole other language. But Inscryption does an excellent job of visually explaining the game mechanics.The game begins with a starter deck of woodland creatures. There are squirrels, and then other creatures. Squirrels could be sacrificed to give powers to the other creatures. The creatures would then attack the enemy, enough to tip over his damage scales \u2014 and make him lose.\nAs I progress ahead and defeat mini-bosses, I build my card decks. The deck building strategy can be as easy or as difficult as we want it to be. A seasoned card-game enthusiast might actually have a strategy. I went the aggressive newb route, accumulating high powered creatures, and levelling up their damage and health every chance I got. If I played it right, I could defeat the enemy in a single move.",

        "The digital landscape has transformed drastically since the era of mainframes. Your company, like many others, has ridden each wave of technological advancement, from minis and microcomputers to the PC revolution, the dot-com boom with Sparcs, and the rise of databases like DB2, Oracle, and SQL Server. You embraced MPP, explored data cubes, and transitioned data to the intranet and internet.  VMware promised to control server sprawl, yet VM sprawl emerged. SharePoint became a fixture, and the allure of SaaS led you from Siebel to Salesforce.\n\nNow, you're drowning in data. Your mainframe is a fragile relic, your SAN a costly black box offering little insight due to rampant VM and application sprawl.  Millennials advocate for \"webscale\" solutions like MongoDB, while Hadoop vendors promise magical insights from data lakes, introducing yet another storage technology to manage.\n\nEnough is enough. This year, regain control of your data.  Here are 12 resolutions to guide your data strategy:\n\n1. **Catalog Your Data:**  Knowing what data you possess is the first step. A comprehensive data mapping system is helpful, but the crucial element is a dedicated effort to locate and document all your data assets.\n\n2. **Map Data Use:** Understand how your data is used by applications and its flow within the organization. Tracking data lineage and dependency, whether through software or manual effort, is vital.  Identify why data is kept, who uses it, and for what purpose. Define the data, its source system, and its usage.\n\n3. **Understand Data Creation:**  Just as NASA\u2019s reliance on incomplete data led to critical errors, understanding your data's origins is crucial. How are numbers derived?  This is an ongoing process, as new data sources constantly emerge, but it's essential for preventing avoidable disasters.\n\n4. **Understand Data Flow:**  Mapping your organization\u2019s data circulatory system\u2014a comprehensive data flow diagram\u2014is essential. This reveals inefficiencies (\"black holes\" and \"miracles\"), redundancies, and opportunities for optimization.  It also highlights where similar processes differ solely by technology stack, allowing for standardization.\n\n5. **Automate Manual Processes:** Manual data manipulation in spreadsheets introduces latency and errors. By mapping your data flow, you can identify these manual processes and automate them, improving efficiency and accuracy.\n\n6. **Embrace Machine Learning:**  Machine learning isn't magic, but it can automate pattern recognition and analysis. Identify at least one business process where machine learning can provide a demonstrable advantage. This is a practical step towards leveraging the power of data.\n\n7. **Prioritize Natural Language and Voice Search:**  The future of data interaction is natural language and voice.  Making your data accessible through these modalities is no longer a luxury but a necessity to cater to evolving user expectations.\n\n8. **Embrace Web Accessibility:**  Shift away from cumbersome desktop software.  Web-based applications offer greater flexibility, easier maintenance, and accessibility from anywhere.\n\n9. **Prioritize Mobile Accessibility:**  Desktop computing is declining.  Ensure your data and applications are accessible on mobile devices to support the increasingly mobile workforce.\n\n10. **Ensure High Availability and Distributability:**  Resilience is key.  Modern distributed databases designed for the cloud offer better uptime, scalability, and more affordable disaster recovery than traditional solutions.\n\n11. **Consolidate Systems:** Simplify your IT infrastructure by consolidating redundant systems. This reduces complexity, maintenance costs, and improves overall efficiency.  While the business case may be challenging, the long-term benefits are significant.\n\n12. **Visualize Data:**  Charts and visualizations make data more accessible and understandable.

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# Justice Department Announces New Policy Protecting Journalists' Records\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Monday that federal prosecutors will no longer seize journalists' phone and email records during leak investigations, marking a significant shift in Justice Department policy.\n\nThis announcement follows the Biden administration's decision to end the controversial practice of using subpoenas and secret court orders to obtain reporters' communications data in pursuit of government leakers.\n\n\"The Department of Justice will no longer use compulsory legal process for the purpose of obtaining information from or records of members of the news media acting within the scope of newsgathering activities,\" Garland stated in a highly anticipated memo to department leadership and federal prosecutors.\n\nUnder this new policy, the Justice Department will cease issuing subpoenas, warrants, and court orders to journalists, their publishers, and third-party service providers to obtain reporters' records. However, certain exceptions remain. The ban excludes cases where a journalist is under criminal investigation or has employed criminal methods to acquire information. Garland clarified that the prohibition still applies when journalists merely possess or publish government information, including classified material, as part of their newsgathering activities.\n\nThe policy change comes in response to recent revelations that the Trump administration's Justice Department secretly obtained phone and email records from reporters at the Washington Post, New York Times, and CNN. The department had also subpoenaed Apple for records belonging to two Democratic congressmen, their staff members, and families as part of a leak investigation.\n\nThese disclosures sparked outrage among journalists and press freedom advocates, prompting an internal review by the Justice Department's inspector general. Garland, who had previously met with executives from the affected news organizations, has expressed support for legislation to make these protections permanent.\n\nIn his memo, Garland directed Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco to review existing departmental regulations and codify these new protections.",

        "Oregon Food Bank CEO Susannah Morgan emphasizes the critical need for food as daily life faces disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With schools closed and many people facing job loss, the demand for food assistance is on the rise.\n\nDespite the challenges, food remains available through various channels, including the Oregon Food Bank's warehouse in Northeast Portland, which currently holds 4 million pounds of food. The organization also works with over 1,400 partner pantries and food assistance sites across Oregon and southwest Washington.\n\nThe demand for food assistance has surged by 20 to 30 percent in recent weeks, a trend expected to continue as unemployment rates climb.

The JNU Students Union (JNUSU) also called for the resignation of Vice-Chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar, claiming he had lost the trust of students and faculty.  These protests escalated, leading to the confinement of three JNU professors, one for over 24 hours, allegedly by their own students, according to news agency IANS.\n\nThis incident prompted 113 JNU teachers to disassociate themselves from the JNU Teachers\u2019 Association (JNUTA) on November 20, accusing the association of indifference to the attack on their colleagues.

The occasion was the launch dinner for her new Nudes shoe collection, held in the Wine Room at Gemma, a quaint Italian restaurant at The Bowery Hotel.\n\nIn collaboration with Moda Operandi, James sought to \"recontextualize what nude means as a woman of color.\" As a designer who is attentive to the nuances of melanin and skin tones, she explained, \u201ca light pink can\u2019t be the only reference for nude.\" The dimly lit room was filled with a table displaying a m\u00e9lange of sandy, chocolate, and hazelnut-hued flats and feathery sandals.

        "Movie enthusiasts know that Hollywood releases its most prestigious films every December, just before the Oscar nomination deadline. Similarly, Broadway sees its most notable openings in the spring, right before the Tony nominations. This year's season is exceptionally crowded, with 18 shows\u2014half of them musicals\u2014debuting in March and April.\n\nLast season was dominated by \"Hamilton,\" which everyone anticipated would win the Tony for Best Musical. However, Barry Weissler, the producer of \"Waitress,\" remained unfazed. \n\n\"They were a massive hit, and some of our investors even begged us to delay for a season,\" Weissler says. \"'Go to Chicago,' one of them suggested, 'and then come back.'\"\n\nYet Weissler already had a theater and a cast in place, and despite not winning a single Tony Award, \"Waitress\" proved to be a profitable success. While Weissler took a gamble, other shows opted to sit out last season and are now opening before this spring's Tony deadline.\n\nScott Mallalieu, owner of GreatWhiteWay.com, a company that sells Broadway tickets to groups, believes that timing can dictate a show's success on Broadway. \n\n\"The general rule of thumb is you don't want to open a show in the fall, because even with good reviews, it can be overshadowed by all the fresh new productions in the spring,\" he explains.\n\nHowever, Mallalieu thinks this year might be an exception, as three hit musicals already opened in the fall: \"Dear Evan Hansen,\" \"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812,\" and \"A Bronx Tale.\"\n\nAccording to Jeremy Gerard, a theater critic for Deadline with four decades of experience covering Broadway, this leaves limited room for new shows to make an impact. He notes that many of these new productions are opening one day after another, vying for a portion of a relatively small audience.\n\n\"The producers know there's going to be a bloodbath,\" Gerard says. \"The total size of the Broadway audience isn't highly flexible, and in fact, the numbers are decreasing. The grosses are going up due to insane ticket prices, led by 'Hamilton' with its $849 top ticket. So, the grosses are skewed, but the actual audience numbers are declining.\"\n\nNevertheless, in an industry where one in four Broadway shows fails, hope is ever-present, and producers employ various strategies to make their shows stand out. Sometimes, they hire a star, like Bette Midler in \"Hello Dolly!\" or adapt a popular movie, like \"Groundhog Day\" or \"Am\u00e9lie.\"\n\nYet some musicals, like last fall's \"Dear Evan Hansen,\" manage to succeed without such strategies. This could also be true for this spring's \"Come From Away,\" an original Canadian musical set in Newfoundland after September 11, 2001, when American airports were closed, and locals hosted 7,000 stranded passengers. Sue Frost, the lead producer of \"Come From Away,\" acknowledges the risk.\n\n\"It was a title that no one understood; it was an ensemble piece with no stars, and people might label it 'the 9/11 musical'\u2014so it was like three strikes!\" Frost remarks.",
        "Hoosier Racing Tire SCCA Super Tour competition got rolling Saturday on a weekend hosted by Cal Club at Buttonwillow Raceway Park in California. The day opened with a second round of qualifying followed by 25-minute timed races on the 2.95-mile circuit being run counterclockwise this year.\n\n2020 GT-3 Challenge Begins: This year\u2019s GT-3 Challenge presented by MPI opened this weekend as part of the Buttonwillow Super Tour event, and the series\u2019 first race took place Saturday in dry conditions. Michael Lewis, in the No. 32 Goodyear Mazda RX-7, started on pole and led every lap on his way to victory. Behind him, however, things got interesting: Taz Harvey\u2019s Mazda RX-7 held down second for most of the race. But Jose Rodriguez, also in a Mazda RX-7, hounded Harvey almost the entire time, grabbing second with only a couple of laps to go. Harvey brought his car home in third to round out the podium.\n\nThe GT-3 Challenge is a series aimed at boosting participation in the GT-3 class and supported by Mazda, Max Papis Innovations, Penske Racing Shocks, AiM Sports, and Hoosier Racing Tire, with new partners Goodyear Tire, Carbotech Performance Brakes, and Bell Racing Helmets jumping aboard this year. There are five scheduled GT-3 Challenge rounds in 2020, the others taking place at Super Tour events at Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta and Watkins Glen International, as well as Road America in July, and finally SCCA\u2019s National Championship Runoffs in October.\n\nThen Came the Rain: Saturday\u2019s second race group consisted of fast, open-cockpit formula and prototype cars. And just as they pulled off grid for their pace lap, a light rain began to fall on the circuit. On slick tires, these cars don\u2019t take kindly to wet surfaces. And on the opening lap in Turn 1, they showed it as a bunch of cars got squirrely, sliding sideways and collecting other cars. Those who emerged victorious after 25 minutes had one heck of a story to tell.\n\n\u201cThere was a big melee at the exit of Turn 1. I\u2019m not sure who was even involved in it, but cars were going everywhere,\u201d said Bill Weaver, who drove his No. 67 James G. Parker Insurance Associates Star Formula Mazda to victory in the Formula X class. \u201cI hit somebody. The front of my car launched up into the air, probably about three feet into the air. But it came down and the wheels were still on, so I just kept driving it. No front wing and a wet track is exciting to say the least. But we got it done, finished the race and had a great time.\u201d\n\nSweep Ceased: Over the last two years, Mike Miserendino has claimed all four Hoosier Super Tour Spec Racer Ford Gen3 races at Buttonwillow Raceway Park. On Saturday, Miserendino looked set to do it again as he came to the white flag with the lead over TJ Acker. But, on the back half of the last lap, the top-two drivers encountered traffic and Acker, driving the No. 62 MBI Racing / Cindescency racecar, ended up crossing the finish line first.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple of lapped cars to deal with, and I thought that would give Mike the tow to keep out in front of me,\u201d said Acker, who also took a win Saturday in Formula Enterprises 2 driving the No. 62 Bulldog Motorsports Formula Enterprises/Mazda car. \u201cBut I got a good run and I think we were three-wide coming off the back straight. I had the inside and had the position getting up the hill \u2026 and got the lead.\u201d\n\nDoubles on the Day: Winning one Hoosier Super Tour event is pretty special. Winning two Super Tour races on the same day, that\u2019s even more special. Besides Acker, two other drivers accomplished that feat on Saturday. One was Christopher Qualls, who drove his Ford Mustang to victory in both Touring 2 and American Sedan. Michael Lewis achieved the same by driving his No. 12 Goodyear Jaguar XKR to victory in GT-1 after claiming the GT-3 win earlier in the day.\n\nPowers On: Leading Spec Miata to the start line Saturday was Dakota Dickerson, a former F4 U.S. and the reigning F3 Americas champion. But early on up front it was Steven Powers, Justin Casey, Tristan Littlehale and Nick Leverone. Several of those drivers took a turn at the front or applied copious amounts of pressure to whomever was leading. On the last lap, Leverone made an amazing run down the backstretch and tried to challenge Powers, who was leading.",

        "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# Body Cameras for Police: A Complex Balance of Oversight and Local Control\n\n*A Reuters Special Report*\n\nAt the NYPD police academy in Queens, New York, a police officer demonstrates a body camera during a news conference on the \"Big Brother\" pilot program involving 60 officers. The December 2014 initiative would later influence nationwide discussions on police accountability.\n\nCivil rights advocates and law enforcement leaders are raising concerns about President Obama's $75 million proposal to equip local police departments with 50,000 body cameras. They emphasize that without robust oversight mechanisms, the technology's deployment could potentially undermine, rather than strengthen, public trust in law enforcement.\n\nThe proposal, which emerged following the Ferguson grand jury decision not to indict a white officer in the shooting death of an unarmed Black teenager, requires congressional approval. While it mandates department training and Justice Department guidance, questions remain about enforcement mechanisms.\n\n## The Oversight Challenge\n\nBarbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee on Civil Rights, emphasizes the critical nature of accountability: \"Without proper enforcement of disciplinary measures, body cameras become meaningless tools, especially in departments with poor track records.\"\n\nDaytona Beach Police Chief Michael Chitwood's experience illustrates this concern. Having implemented body cameras since 2010, he recently dismissed an officer for deactivating their camera during a violent incident. Chitwood advocates for strong federal guidelines that can withstand local political pressures and union influence.\n\nHowever, not all law enforcement leaders share this perspective. Greenville Police Chief Ken Miller argues for local autonomy: \"Every community has unique challenges and dynamics that require tailored approaches.\"\n\n## Implementation Hurdles\n\nThe Police Executive Research Forum's recent study revealed that among 63 agencies using body cameras, one-third lack written policies governing their use. Critical questions remain unresolved:\n\n- Privacy concerns in private residences\n- Data storage duration\n- Public access to footage\n- Mandatory activation protocols\n\nResearch from Arizona State University demonstrates the impact of clear policies: officers are 20% more likely to activate their cameras when required by departmental policy.\n\n## The Federal Role Debate\n\nThe discussion reflects America's traditional tension between federal oversight and local control. While some lawmakers support body cameras in principle, they question federal involvement in local law enforcement.\n\nState-level oversight may offer a middle ground. Several states, including Utah, Kansas, and Mississippi, are developing legislation to regulate body camera use. New Jersey's pending bill would require all state and local officers to wear cameras under attorney general guidelines.\n\nEvesham Police Chief Christopher Chew advocates for consistent national standards: \"Federal implementation should establish clear country-wide expectations while respecting local needs.\"\n\nAs body camera technology continues to proliferate among law enforcement agencies, finding the right balance between federal oversight and local autonomy remains crucial for ensuring both accountability and effectiveness.",
        "In response to a widely circulated video capturing an incident in a sex toy shop in Abuja, Nollywood actress Kate Henshaw has rejected Senator Elisha Abbo's apology for assaulting a nursing mother.

While the weekend brought lows of 12\u00b0C, dark clouds, and drizzle, Tuesday will see a return of sunshine and highs of 19\u00b0C.  Clouds will persist throughout the week, but the forecast remains largely dry into the weekend.\n\nThursday is expected to see the highest temperatures, reaching 20\u00b0C, with sunny intervals predicted for the weekend.

Beyond the impressive statistics, Shepard\u2019s maximum effort on every single play was particularly noteworthy. He deserves full credit for his outstanding Week 10 performance.\n\nStock down: Janoris Jenkins.  In stark contrast to Shepard's performance, Janoris Jenkins deserves the wave of criticism coming his way.  Typically a dominant cornerback, Jenkins allowed four receptions on four targets for 111 yards and a touchdown.  He also missed three tackles and appeared to give minimal effort throughout the game, culminating in his decision to walk out on reporters after the loss.",
        "A New and United Guyana (ANUG) asserts that it's time for smaller parties with shared ideologies to unite and target an estimated 35,000 independent voters seeking an end to racially driven politics.  These parties aim to leverage potential National Assembly seats to push for crucial policy and legal reforms.\n\nANUG Chairman, Timothy Jonas, confirmed securing the support of the Federal United Party (FED-UP) for the March 2, 2020, general elections.  However, other parties, including Lenox Shuman\u2019s Liberty and Justice Party (LJP), remain unconvinced.\n\nJonas stated that ANUG and FED-UP would jointly contest the elections, though their combined name and ballot symbol will be announced later this week following a joint press conference.  He acknowledged that ANUG\u2019s individual identity might not be fully retained but downplayed concerns, drawing a parallel with the Alliance For Change (AFC).  \"As subsumed as the AFC has become, they are still identifiable.  Similarly, these two standalone, self-sufficient parties will work together without fear of losing their identities.\"\n\nANUG Assistant Secretary, Kian Jabour, highlighted FED-UP's interest in developing a constituency system where parliamentarians are directly accountable to their constituents.  \"We firmly believe our current parliamentary system doesn't represent all Guyanese.  The majority of seats are allocated by political parties, creating 'yes-men' who must adhere to party lines, as evidenced by recent events surrounding the no-confidence motion.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the shared good intentions of smaller parties, Jabour noted that many haven't embraced the strategic advantage of a unified campaign. Jonas praised The New Movement, a group of young professionals he described as \"good-hearted, sincere people who want the best for Guyana,\" urging public support despite some of their ideas being arguably unrealistic.\n\nHe confirmed ongoing discussions with the Citizenship Initiative, stating, \"Members of our executives have spoken; the outcome remains uncertain.\"  He also mentioned that ANUG has not yet engaged with Robert Badal\u2019s Change Guyana party.\n\nJonas realistically acknowledged the difficulty of small parties winning outright in Guyana but emphasized their potential to hold the balance of power in the 65-seat National Assembly.  He pointed to the over 30,000 independent voters, previously AFC supporters, now seeking a genuine third-party alternative. \"Mathematically, if these parties compete amongst themselves for these independent voters, each will likely receive less than 5,000 votes.\" He criticized the tendency of small parties to make unrealistic campaign promises despite the prevailing reality of race-based voting.\n\nANUG's primary focus, according to Jonas, is to act as a broker for effective legislation, sound policies, and constitutional reform. \"With approximately 80% of the population voting along ethnic lines, we must be realistic.  Making promises about governing would be deceptive.",

        "Sebastian Vettel has led calls for an investigation into the apparent tyre failures suffered by Lance Stroll and Max Verstappen during the Formula 1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Both drivers suffered heavy high-speed crashes after their left-rear tyres seemed to give way, prompting concern for driver safety on the track.\n\nOn Lap 30, Stroll was pitched into the wall on the drivers\u2019 left as he rounded Turn 19\u2014a kink in the long front straight. The Canadian was still running the hard compound Pirelli tyres on which he\u2019d started the race at the time of the incident. Later, Verstappen crashed out only metres up the road with a seemingly identical problem, having pitted on Lap 12 to swap his soft tyres for a set of the hard compound rubber and crashing out 32 laps later.\n\nIndeed, it prompted Red Bull\u2019s sporting director Jonathan Wheatley to radio FIA race director Michael Masi, advising that there was no warning prior to Verstappen\u2019s failure. He effectively recommended the race be red-flagged on safety grounds. Speeds down the more than two-kilometre front straight in Baku easily exceed 300kmh, making it one of the fastest sections of track all season. As a street circuit, it is hemmed in by walls, offering little opportunity for the driver to react and save the car before careering into a concrete barrier.\n\n\u201cI saw that he lost the car very late in the straight,\u201d Vettel said of his Aston Martin team-mate Stroll\u2019s crash. \u201cI thought maybe first he clipped the wall outside of 19. But then I looked the next lap, and there was not a scratch. That would have been very unusual, but I couldn\u2019t explain why he would crash so late in the straight.",

The National Weather Service issued high wind warnings for Oregon and the Pacific Coast of Washington, with wind advisories for inland areas.\n\nBy Friday evening, more than 109,000 customers in Western Washington were without power. The impact of the storm was felt on various modes of transportation, with high-speed passenger ferry sailings being canceled due to the dangerous conditions. Dramatic footage shared by Washington State Ferries showed waves crashing over the bow of a ferry traveling from Bainbridge Island to Seattle.\n\nIn Seattle, winds gusted to at least 40 mph on Friday evening, prompting the NWS to issue a wind advisory for the area. Near downtown Seattle, trees blocked on-ramps to Interstate 90 from Rainier Avenue South, while power outages affected the Mercer Island tunnel farther east along I-90.\n\nAs of 7:30 p.m., approximately 43,000 Seattle City Light customers were without power.

        "In Ankara, Turkey, on May 5, 2016, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu announced his decision to step down during a news conference at his ruling AK Party headquarters. This decision has raised concerns among German politicians about the future of Turkish governance, primarily due to the potential increase in President Tayipp Erdogan\u2019s power.\n\nDavutoglu is perceived in Europe as the more liberal face of the Turkish government. In contrast, Erdogan is heavily focused on establishing a powerful executive presidency, which critics argue could lead Turkey, an EU candidate, toward authoritarianism. Davutoglu had played a crucial role in negotiating a deal with Brussels to stem the flow of illegal migrants to Europe, a key factor that German Chancellor Angela Merkel hopes will bolster support for her conservatives ahead of a federal election next year.\n\nPoliticians from Germany's ruling coalition expressed their concerns on Thursday about the implications of Davutoglu's departure. Niels Annen, the Social Democrats' spokesman on foreign affairs, part of Merkel's coalition, told Reuters, \"Erdogan will be able to push ahead with his plans to change the constitution now without opposition from his own ranks.\" He added, \"In view of the prevailing climate of repression and the current debate about lifting the immunity of opposition lawmakers, this is bad news.\"\n\nErdogan's ruling AK Party has faced criticism for backtracking on media freedoms. It also aims to remove lawmakers' immunity from prosecution, a move seen as targeting a pro-Kurdish party in the Turkish parliament. Juergen Hardt, the foreign affairs spokesman for Merkel's conservatives, also expressed concern about Davutoglu's departure, stating, \"Turkey will decide itself whether its future path leads to Europe or towards greater isolation.\"\n\nGerman politicians have long followed Turkish affairs closely due to the significant Turkish community in Germany and the countries' trade relations. Germany, home to around three million people of ethnic Turkish background, is a vital trade partner for Turkey. The EU migrant deal with Turkey has been Davutoglu's project, yet Erdogan, frequently critical of the 28-nation bloc, has sometimes appeared to belittle his progress.\n\nThe migration issue remains a pressing concern for Germany.",

        "Congress: Act Now To Repeal SALT Deduction Cap\nAs part of their 2017 overhaul of the tax code, the previous administration set a $10,000 cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes. Whether it was truly a petty act of revenge aimed at political adversaries matters little at this point; the result was a backdoor tax hike for Nassau residents that was folded into a so-called \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act.\u201d U.S. Rep. Thomas Suozzi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York recently revealed that they filed legislation to repeal the federal State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap. This proposal deserves swift consideration and approval by the House of Representatives and U.S. Senate.\nThen, it was painful. Now, amidst the sharp economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is simply devastating. Thankfully, President Biden has indicated his support for eliminating the cap and the concept enjoys bipartisan support amongst Long Island\u2019s Congressional delegation. Momentum is building\u2014and not a moment too soon. As a result of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, Nassau County and the region are still reeling from an alarming spike in unemployment and food insecurity. Repealing the SALT deduction cap would provide an essential boost to our long-term recovery and deliver meaningful relief to many Nassau families.\nDrucker, of Plainview, is Nassau County Legislator for the 16th Legislative District.\nThe Truth About The SALT Deduction\nThis is a response to the letter to the editor by Legislator Arnold Drucker on eliminating the limit on state and local taxes. The SALT cap of $10,000 was initially described as a disastrously provision for New York citizens. It did not turn out that way. For very many middle income families it actually resulted in a tax saving. While our SALT is over $15,000 the greatly increased standard deduction more than covered that and resulted in lower taxes. Studies indicate that many more lower and middle income families are using the standard deduction now (and saving money). One report stated that these families\u2019 deductions grew from $900 million to $2.3 billion from the higher standard deduction. The SALT cap mainly affects high earners. So what do they do to compensate for it? They purchase tax-free government bonds and that helps New York State by lowering the borrowing interest\u2014a significant saving to the state.",
        "A former police detective is behind bars after stealing thousands of pounds in cash seized from passengers at Heathrow Airport. Michael Harrington, 46, from Staines, worked at the airport as a Detective Sergeant with the Metropolitan Police, tasked with carrying out financial investigations and seizing unauthorised cash from those travelling in and out of the country. During his five years in the role, between July 2009 and July 2015, it is estimated that he stole between \u00a375,000 and \u00a383,000 from 16 victims, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\n\nIn some instances, Harrington seized cash from victims and then falsely recorded that it had been given back after it was found to be lawful money. In others, he recorded the amounts seized to be less than they actually were, pocketing whole sums in the process. The disgraced former financial investigator was jailed for four-and-a-half years for 16 counts of theft at Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday (February 28).\n\nRiaz Jakhura, from the CPS London\u2019s Complex Casework unit, said: \"Harrington took advantage of a number of passengers, including foreign nationals making their way through Heathrow Airport. He abused his position as a financial investigator for the police, contributing to significant stress and financial hardship for some of his victims. The overwhelming evidence against Harrington meant that he had no choice but to admit his crimes.\"\n\nTwo victims suffered financial loss when attending weddings abroad without the legitimate money they had planned to take with them. On one occasion, Harrington denied a victim the opportunity to have an interpreter present when confiscating legitimate money. He was caught when victims started to contact police about getting back the money seized, leading the police to Harrington. Harrington, who had been suspended from the Met Police pending the completion of the court case, admitted the thefts in October last year.\n\nHe had previously failed to turn up to an earlier sentence hearing, prompting a warrant for his arrest.",

        "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- While hawksbill turtles are not the only marine turtles endangered by the destabilizing effects of climate change, a recent study by researchers at Florida State University indicates that this critically endangered species is particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, was conducted by FSU's Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science. It suggests that projected increases in air temperatures, rainfall, and intense solar radiation could significantly reduce hatching success for hawksbills at several major nesting beaches.\n\nHistorically, Earth has experienced numerous climate shifts. However, researchers point out that today's rapid climate changes, combined with unrestrained human development, pose unprecedented threats to hawksbills and other marine turtles.\n\n\"Marine turtles have existed for millions of years and have adapted to significant climatic changes during that time,\" said Mariana Fuentes, Assistant Professor of Oceanography and co-author of the study. \"In the past, they adapted by shifting their nesting grounds and seasons to align with more favorable conditions. However, increasing threats to nesting habitats from coastal construction, storms, and rising sea levels are jeopardizing their ability to adapt.\"\n\nTo assess the impact of climate change on hawksbill hatching success, FSU researchers analyzed over 5,000 nests from five Brazilian beaches, where most regional hawksbill nesting occurs. The team focused on five climatic variables\u2014air temperature, rainfall, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed\u2014to develop a comprehensive model of the subtle effects of a changing climate on the sensitive incubation process.\n\n\"There is a lack of research on how climate change might affect hawksbills, especially this population,\" said Natalie Montero, a former FSU graduate student who led the study. \"We chose to investigate the impact on hatchling production because significant changes in the number of baby marine turtles born can dramatically affect population stability.\"\n\nAs reptiles, marine turtles rely on external heat sources for body temperature regulation, making hawksbills and their relatives particularly sensitive to air temperature. This sensitivity is most evident in marine turtle nests, where extreme temperature fluctuations can influence egg incubation, dictate sex ratios, and determine hatching success.\n\nFor some marine turtle species, rising temperatures might not necessarily result in less successful incubation. For instance, a study by Montero and Fuentes published earlier this year showed that for loggerhead turtles on the temperate nesting beaches of North Florida, changing conditions might lead to potential short-term increases in hatching success by 1 to 7.6 percent.\n\nHowever, the outlook for hawksbills is less promising. Montero and Fuentes found that rising air temperatures, coupled with increased rainfall and solar radiation, are projected to reduce overall hatching success at Brazilian nesting sites by up to 11 percent by 2100. Elevated temperatures may warm nests beyond the threshold for healthy incubation, while increased rainfall could saturate the soil and suffocate the embryos.\n\nEven if the turtles manage to incubate successfully and hatch, they face the challenge of heightened solar radiation, which could heat the sand to the point of causing the nests to collapse\u2014a major hazard for hatchlings as they make their way to the sea.\n\nAlthough the future might seem bleak for this already dwindling species, Montero believes there is still time for humans to mitigate the impact.\n\n\"Humans can support marine turtles in numerous ways,\" she said. \"Reducing coastal construction and protecting more coastal habitat will help ensure that both current and future nesting sites are available. It's also crucial to minimize human impact on dune structures and beach vegetation. Additionally, reducing trash and microplastics on the beach can create a higher quality nesting and incubation environment.\"\n\nMaria A.G. dei Marcovaldi, Milagros Lopez-Mendilaharsu, Alexsandro S. Santos, and Armando J. B. Santos from the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Pr\u00f3-Tamar in Brazil contributed to this research.

        "Flying with an unhappy child is no fun for anyone; everyone knows that. But it wasn\u2019t until I asked for your tips, tricks, and traumatic tales of babies on planes that I realized just how many different groups were affected. Whether you\u2019re a parent, a baby, or someone trapped in the same flying metal tube with them, help is at hand.\n\nThe misery is widespread: the kids are distressed, the parents are dying a thousand deaths from shame and frustration, and the flight attendants suffer stress. Meanwhile, everyone else on the plane is either irritated or graciously pretending that they\u2019re not. The stories you shared could fill a book, to be shelved under either humor or horror.\n\nFor instance, Wren West wrote, \u201cI have a four-year-old, which is akin to having a monkey-cat hybrid.\u201d During a departure delay, her son became a thrashing wild man. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t cost $600, I would have just asked to be taken off the plane right then and there,\u201d Ms. West noted. \u201cI bet all 100 passengers would have pitched in.\u201d\n\nMatt Hubbard had a memorable moment at baggage claim. His son was on his shoulders as he approached his parents, who had come to greet the flight. \u201cJust as I was able to catch their eye,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy son threw up all over the top of my head, covering my glasses.\u201d\n\nSome incidents are simply baffling.

        "Japan\u2019s consumption of green tea has been steadily declining, but a new breed of casual cafes specializing in the traditional brew is aiming to reverse this trend.  These cafes introduce customers to a wide variety of brands and unconventional serving methods, hoping to reignite interest in the beverage.  Pioneering this movement was Iemon Salon Kyoto, opened about a decade ago by the Suntory Group.  Designed to evoke the atmosphere of traditional Kyoto machiya townhouses, Iemon Salon offers a modern take on tea culture, pairing green tea varieties like sencha, h\u014djicha, matcha, and gyokuro with meals, sweets, and even tea-based cocktails and beer. Prices range from \u00a5518 for sencha and h\u014djicha to \u00a5928 for a cup of gyokuro.  The cafe's manager emphasizes their mission: \u201cWe hope to deliver the culture and spirit of Japan to the world through tea.\u201d\n\nFollowing in this innovative spirit is Tokyo Saryo, which opened in January in Tokyo's Sangenjaya district.  The location is fitting, as \u201cSangenjaya\u201d translates to \u201cthree tea houses,\u201d a name derived from the area\u2019s history of tea establishments hundreds of years ago.  With its minimalist design featuring plaster walls and only nine seats surrounding the service counter, Tokyo Saryo encourages a focused tea-tasting experience.  The cafe offers rotating monthly menus featuring a selection of 25 tea brands.  Customers can sample two different brews of each tea: one at 70 degrees Celsius to highlight the tea's richness, and a second at 80 degrees Celsius to bring out its bitter and astringent notes.  Menus include detailed explanations of each brand's characteristics, catering to those less familiar with the nuances of green tea.  Sets are priced at \u00a51,300 for two teas and sweets, or \u00a5800 for one tea and sweets.\n\nA key element of Tokyo Saryo\u2019s approach is the interactive experience.  Staff are available to discuss the teas, offering insights into production areas and flavor profiles.  This educational aspect draws in both young Japanese and international visitors, providing an opportunity to discover new favorite varieties. One overheard conversation illustrates this engagement: a customer remarked, \u201cThis tea tastes deep,\u201d to which a staff member responded, \u201cWhen you make tea at a low temperature you get the (taste of) amino acids.  Some people have told me that the color makes it look like broth.\u201d  This emphasis on education and discussion, coupled with the unique brewing method\u2014hand-pouring hot water over the leaves, similar to hand-drip coffee\u2014sets Tokyo Saryo apart.  As one staff member explains, \u201cWe are happy to answer any questions about tea\u2026 so you can enjoy the depth of the (world of) tea.\u201d",
        "Here's the polished version of the article:\n\n# Pilot Training Industry at Risk as Major School Faces Closure\n\nThe potential shutdown of Hamilton's prestigious L3 Airline Academy could herald a broader crisis in New Zealand's pilot training industry, which contributes $226 million annually to the economy.\n\nL3 Airline Academy, renowned globally for pilot training excellence, faces likely closure in February 2021 due to border restrictions preventing international student entry. The academy has already implemented its own isolation facilities and received $836,000 in wage subsidies earlier this year.\n\nAviation NZ Chief Executive John Nicholson emphasized that his organization has been alerting the Government to the industry's challenges since May. \"While L3 Academy isn't lost to New Zealand today, we need urgent government intervention to preserve both it and the broader international pilot training sector,\" he stated.\n\n## Economic Impact\n\nThe international pilot training industry in New Zealand:\n- Generates $51m in foreign exchange earnings\n- Creates economic activity exceeding $226m, primarily in regional areas\n- Employs over 380 staff, including 225 flight instructors\n- Maintains assets valued at approximately $100m\n\n## Current Situation\n\nDespite 394 international students having signed up for training in September, none can enter the country, even those with visas. Nicholson suggests that allocating 440 visas over six months\u2014matching the number granted to Russian fishermen\u2014would be sufficient to sustain the industry.\n\nInternational student pilots typically:\n- Pay $80,000 in annual tuition fees\n- Stay up to 18 months in New Zealand\n- Secure airline employment upon completing training\n\n## Strategic Opportunity\n\nNew Zealand's successful COVID-19 management and high-quality training programs have attracted increased interest from international airlines seeking alternatives to traditional training partners. \"We have an unprecedented strategic advantage,\" Nicholson noted. \"Never before have we had so many airlines interested in training their future leaders here.\"\n\nHowever, domestic student training alone isn't economically viable, as international students typically comprise 70% of enrollment.\n\n## Government Response\n\nCOVID Recovery Minister Chris Hipkins maintained that public health remains the top priority. While acknowledging the aviation sector's difficulties, he cited limited capacity in managed isolation facilities as a key constraint, particularly regarding essential workforce availability.\n\nThe Government has provided support through:\n- $51m funding for sector recovery\n- Levy removals\n- Hibernation options for private tertiary establishments\n- Entry allowance for 250 international PhD and postgraduate students\n\n## Industry Perspective\n\nAndrew Ridling, NZ Air Line Pilots Association president and Dreamliner captain, highlighted New Zealand's unique training environment: \"Our challenging topography and dynamic weather patterns provide some of the world's most demanding and high-level pilot training, particularly valuable for Northern Hemisphere airlines.\"\n\nThe industry warns that L3's closure could trigger a domino effect among other training providers, potentially compromising New Zealand's position in the global aviation training market just as the sector prepares for post-pandemic recovery.",

Trailing the No. 77 Mazda is Felipe Nasr in the No. 31 Action Express Cadillac. Nasr, starting fourth, climbed to second, overtaking both Jonathan Bomarito in the No. 55 Mazda at the start and later, Juan Pablo Montoya in the No. 6 Acura at the Bus Stop.\n\nMontoya currently holds third in the No. 6 Penske Acura, followed by Bomarito and Ricky Taylor, who has impressively recovered from his 20th-place qualifying position due to an off-track excursion, now running fifth in the sister Acura.\n\nThe LMP2 class has been dominated by Ben Keating in the No. 52 PR1 ORECA/Riley Motorsports Mercedes. Keating built a commanding 40-second lead, even lapping the last-in-class No. 18 Era Motorsports ORECA.  His pace significantly outmatched the other gentlemen drivers who started the race, often running within a second or two of the DPis.  Ben Hanley, in the No. 81 DragonSpeed ORECA, took over from Henrik Hedman during the first pit stops, aiming to close the substantial gap to Keating.  The No. 38 Performance Tech ORECA, repaired overnight after Don Yount's practice session incident, runs third with Cameron Cassels at the wheel.\n\nThe GT class witnessed considerable shuffling after the initial pit stops. Nick Tandy leads in the No. 911 Porsche, reclaiming the top spot after the No.",
        "Photo: Victoria Song/Gizmodo\n\nIn 2019, Apple integrated period-tracking into the iOS Health app and launched a clinical study on women's health. The Apple Women's Health Study team has now analyzed preliminary data showing a wide range of period symptoms experienced by menstruating individuals globally.\n\nThe initial findings were based on the participation of 10,000 individuals who enrolled in the study via the iPhone Research app and provided demographic details. Out of these, 6,141 participants reported period symptoms, with the most common being abdominal cramps (83%), bloating (63%), and fatigue (61%). Other frequently noted symptoms included acne, headaches, mood swings, changes in appetite, lower back pain, and breast tenderness. Less common symptoms recorded were diarrhea, sleep disturbances, constipation, nausea, hot flashes, and ovulation pain.\n\nA significant observation was that irrespective of race, ethnicity, age, or location, the frequency of symptoms was nearly uniform. Cramps, bloating, and fatigue were consistently reported as the most prevalent symptoms across the board, highlighting the impact these symptoms can have on any individual experiencing menstruation.\n\nWhile these findings might seem apparent to those familiar with menstrual cycles, they underscore the inadequacies in current medical research concerning women's health.\n\nDr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, a principal investigator on the study and an assistant professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, emphasized the limited research in menstrual health despite advancements in cycle-tracking tools. Historically, menstrual health research has been marginalized, with women underrepresented in crucial large-scale studies.\n\nA search for \"menstruation\" in PubMed between 2001 and 2018 yielded around 8,400 studies, significantly fewer than searches for other health issues like cardiovascular diseases or gender-specific conditions like prostate cancer or erectile dysfunction. The underrepresentation of women in clinical research, which persisted until Congress mandated their inclusion in trials in 1993, has led to a dearth of fundamental data and substandard healthcare for women.\n\nNotably, wearables manufacturers have also contributed to this issue. While fitness trackers have been available since 2011, they were slow to incorporate features like cycle tracking. Apple and Ava are among the few companies engaging in clinical research specifically focusing on women's health.\n\nThe Apple Women's Health Study's initial results may not be groundbreaking, but the study's existence marks a positive step forward. Wearables offer a potential avenue to collect long-term data non-invasively, potentially opening doors for new discoveries and increased research in women's health. By involving a broad range of participants, this study has the potential to address the lack of foundational data in women's health.\n\nDr. Mahalingaiah stressed the need for further research on menstrual cycles, their implications for long-term health, and the impact of environmental factors on cycle characteristics. By establishing a comprehensive data set, studies like these can pave the way for advancements in women's health research and care.",

        "The Federal Reserve on Saturday announced that it was reviewing the procedures for the annual stress tests that banks must undergo to demonstrate their resilience, following a correction in the test results. The U.S. central bank considers these stress tests crucial for safeguarding the financial industry's health post-crisis and is exploring potential adjustments to the procedures in response to the incident, according to a spokesperson.\n\nA spokeswoman stated, \"We are examining the cause of the error and taking steps to prevent such occurrences in the future.\" On March 21, the Fed revised the results for several of the 30 banks that participated in the stress tests, a day after the initial results were released. This adjustment did not impact which banks passed the examination, as most saw minimal changes in their capital ratios under stress.\n\nIn a significant development, the Fed rejected Citigroup's plans for increased shareholder payouts due to the test results, marking the second time in three years that the bank failed to obtain approval from the Fed for its capital distribution plans. This outcome had a negative impact on the bank's stock, causing a decline of more than 5%.\n\nCEO Michael Corbat, who has been focused on repairing Citi's relationship with regulators since assuming office in late 2012, faced a setback with this news. The Fed mentioned that discrepancies in handling capital actions and assumptions related to compensation contributed to the adjustments in the capital ratios of the banks.\n\nThe Fed reiterated that an annual review of the stress test process was standard practice and emphasized the importance of identifying and rectifying any errors to maintain the integrity of the examination.

Fearing the implications of having a dead body, Kadam placed Santosh in a tempo.  He attempted to locate Santosh's residence in Malwadi but was unsuccessful, ultimately disposing of the body near Lohiya Garden.\n\nA post-mortem conducted at Sassoon General Hospital revealed that Santosh had been strangled. Consequently, a murder case (Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code) was registered at Hadapsar police station and subsequently transferred to Loni Kalbhor police station.",
        "The Pittsburgh Steelers held their final practice before Monday\u2019s game against Washington, and three key players were missing.  Starting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger (knee) was held out and listed as questionable, as was starting cornerback Steven Nelson (knee), who is doubtful for Monday.  Placekicker Chris Boswell (hip) was also sidelined and is questionable for the game.\n\nNelson\u2019s absence is expected, as he suffered a knee injury against Baltimore on Wednesday and underwent an MRI on Thursday.  Boswell\u2019s hip issue, however, is new, as he wasn't on the injury report before Saturday. If Boswell can't play, the Steelers will likely elevate Matthew Wright from the practice squad.  The Steelers signed Wright just five days ago, choosing him over Brandon Wright, a 23-year-old rookie from Georgia State, after a tryout.\n\nAt the time, it appeared Wright's signing was a precaution against a COVID-19 emergency, as the Steelers also added a backup long-snapper to the practice squad. But the move may also have been  preemptive, given Boswell\u2019s hip.\n\nWright, a Central Florida alum, isn't entirely new to the Steelers, although he hasn't kicked in a regular-season NFL game.  He signed with Pittsburgh as an undrafted free agent in 2019 and competed with Boswell for the placekicking job during the preseason, converting five of six field goal attempts.  The Steelers ultimately stuck with Boswell, who rewarded them with a resurgent 2019 season and a stellar 2020 performance (16 of 17 field goals made).",

        "IRON MOUNTAIN, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The rhythmic *thwack* of pickleball paddles is disrupting the summer nights for some residents of this northern Michigan community.  While some might suspect rowdy teenagers, the source of the noise complaints in Iron Mountain comes from adults enjoying the popular sport.  The city considered restricting pickleball hours at its four courts, with City Manager Jordan Stanchina suggesting a 6 p.m. curfew. However, after 20 pickleball players attended a recent city council meeting to voice their objections, the city decided against the restriction.  Roxanne Hudson, whose property abuts the courts, expressed her frustration, saying she and her husband are so disturbed by the noise they are considering moving.",

        "George passed away peacefully on Christmas Day (25Dec16) after reportedly suffering heart failure at the age of 53. Now editors at The Sun, a newspaper the openly-gay star regularly called out during his lifetime for labeling him a \"p**f\" and a \"pervert\", are proposing that his 1984 single Careless Whisper be reissued, with all proceeds benefiting George's favorite charities.\n\nHowever, George's Wham! bandmate Andrew is unimpressed with the idea and has taken issue with the song choice because it is so closely associated with their band. Although Careless Whisper was George's first solo record, Andrew co-wrote the smash hit and it was released while Wham! was still performing. The track also made it onto Wham! album Make It Big.

        "A recent study suggests that red wine, particularly a plant compound called resveratrol found in it, may have beneficial effects on depression and anxiety for those who enjoy a glass in the evening. Resveratrol is known for its potential heart health benefits, and the study published in Neuropharmacology now indicates that it could also aid in alleviating depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\nThe study, which focused on the impact of resveratrol in mice and built upon previous in vitro research, concluded that resveratrol may help protect against corticosterone, a stress hormone associated with depression and anxiety. While resveratrol is just one of the compounds in red wine, it is important to note that alcohol, as a whole, acts as a depressant on the body\u2019s central nervous system (CNS). Although CNS depressants may not induce immediate feelings of sadness, prolonged use can lead to lethargy, muscle weakness, agitation, and impaired judgment.\n\nMoreover, alcohol consumption can disrupt the sleep-wake cycle and cause attention deficits, potentially leading to issues such as blackouts. While temporary feelings of euphoria and altered judgment may accompany alcohol consumption, sustained and heavy use can have lasting effects on memory and immune functions. These effects are commonly associated with depression, such as disrupted sleep, altered judgment, lethargy, agitation, and muscle weakness.\n\nThe relationship between red wine, depression, and anxiety is multifaceted. While resveratrol has shown promise in lowering stress hormone levels linked to these conditions, it is essential to consider the broader impact of alcohol consumption. Scientific knowledge has long suggested that red wine can benefit heart health due to its polyphenol antioxidants, including resveratrol. However, recent research indicates that individuals with diets naturally high in resveratrol do not necessarily have reduced risks of heart disease or cancer.\n\nDr. Kenneth Mukamal from Harvard Health advises putting claims of resveratrol's heart health benefits into context alongside other lifestyle factors and alcohol consumption. Understanding the effects of different drinking patterns and types of alcoholic beverages is crucial. While acknowledging the potential anti-depression and anti-anxiety effects of resveratrol in red wine, it is essential to consider the broader impact of alcohol on the CNS.\n\nIf you or someone you know requires assistance for mental health concerns, resources are available from the National Alliance on Mental Health (NAMI) website or by calling 1-800-950-NAMI (6264).

        "A married businessman's mistress has been arrested for allegedly orchestrating the contract killing of his other lover. Psychologist Elena Sosnovskaya, along with four men believed to be involved in the murder of dancer Natalia Pronina on December 23, appeared in a Moscow court last week.\n\nPronina, aged 30, was fatally shot at close range by a hooded man wearing a mask in Moscow as she returned home from a choreography session. The businessman, who is said to be romantically involved with both women but has not been named, is reported to be married with children.\n\nSosnovskaya is accused of soliciting her boyfriend to find an assassin to eliminate her romantic rival, Pronina. The tragic incident occurred as Pronina, a prize-winning dancer, was returning home near the Akademicheskaya metro station in Moscow.\n\nDuring a custody hearing at the Cheryomushinsky court in Moscow, footage showed Sosnovskaya being escorted into a glass case. The 40-year-old psychologist allegedly used her partner to locate the hitman for carrying out the murder.\n\nPreviously, suspicions had arisen about the businessman's wife being involved in the murder plot, while a politician rumored to be dating Pronina was also briefly linked to the case. The assailant shot Pronina twice in the chest before fleeing the scene, deploying a stun grenade to divert attention.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Pronina was rushed to the hospital but succumbed to her injuries two hours later. Reports suggest that Pronina had been acquainted with the businessman for nearly a decade and had recently ended their relationship upon meeting a new boyfriend.\n\nSosnovskaya, who was reportedly dating the businessman concurrently with Pronina, allegedly instructed her live-in boyfriend to hire an assassin to carry out the murder. The boyfriend, along with three other men named as Artak Aivazyan, Khasan Tagirov, and Ruslan Tagirov, was also taken into custody in connection with the crime.\n\nThe businessman, who owns a chain of car parts stores, had cautioned Pronina to exercise caution and refrain from posting on Instagram. Investigative Committee official Yulia Ivanova confirmed that the suspects are being detained under Russian laws pertaining to contract killings and illegal possession of firearms.",

        "PARIS - US Open champion Sloane Stephens stated on Tuesday that her friendship with Madison Keys remains unaffected, despite their upcoming French Open semi-final match at Roland Garros, a rematch of last year's final at Flushing Meadows. The 10th seed delivered a commanding performance to defeat Russian Daria Kasatkina, who had previously eliminated world number two Caroline Wozniacki, with a score of 6-3, 6-1 on Court Philippe Chatrier in the quarter-finals. Earlier in the day, the 13th seed Keys secured a spot in the semi-finals for the first time by defeating Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva 7-6 (7/5), 6-4.\n\nStephens, who clinched her first Grand Slam title in New York last September with a 6-3, 6-0 victory over Keys, emphasized that their off-court relationship will not be affected by their upcoming on-court clash. She shared, \"When we step onto the court, it's time to compete. But until then, there will be no awkwardness or tension between us.\" Stephens narrowly avoided an early exit in the third round against Camila Giorgi before securing an 8-6 victory in the deciding set.\n\nThis year marks the first time since 2002 that two American women have reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros, with Serena Williams prevailing over sister Venus in that year's final after a semi-final victory against Jennifer Capriati. Stephens, who was ranked 957th just six weeks before her maiden Grand Slam triumph last year due to injury setbacks, has now made it to a major semi-final for the third time. Reflecting on the achievement, the 25-year-old remarked, \"Having two Americans in the semi-finals of the French Open is pretty remarkable. It guarantees that at least one American will be in the final, which is truly special. Overall, it's a situation where no one has anything to complain about.\"\n\nDuring her match against Kasatkina, Stephens and her opponent exchanged breaks early in the match. Stephens' powerful shots in the eighth game earned her the opportunity to serve for the set, which she successfully did, including a stunning backhand drop shot. In the second set, despite Kasatkina starting strong with a service hold, Stephens broke in the third game with a sharp cross-court forehand and sailed to victory after just an hour and 10 minutes of play.\n\nKeys, on the other hand, demonstrated her prowess by hitting 30 winners against Putintseva to secure her semi-final spot. Although Keys struggled under pressure at the US Open last year, she is confident that this experience will not impact her upcoming match at Roland Garros. In her match against Putintseva, Keys displayed mental resilience, bouncing back from a break in the seventh game to claim the set in a tie-break.\n\nLooking ahead, two-time champion Maria Sharapova is set to face 2016 winner Garbine Muguruza in the other half of the draw, while world number one Simona Halep will take on double Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber on Wednesday.",

Approximately 150 people have donated their time at the Clark County Combined Health District\u2019s clinic located at the Upper Valley Mall, according to Sandy Miller, the district\u2019s Medical Reserve Corps coordinator and nursing supervisor.\n\n\"I felt I had the time, the knowledge, and the ability to make a difference,\" said Dr. John Dobson, one of the volunteers.  Dr. Dobson, a recently retired orthopedic surgeon with over 30 years of experience, traded his scalpel for a needle a year ago to vaccinate his fellow community members.\n\n\"It's been rewarding,\" Dr. Dobson remarked. \"The people coming in to be vaccinated are incredibly positive and grateful to be here.\"\n\nVolunteers comprise up to two-thirds of the staff at the clinic, Miller explained.  They come from both medical and non-medical backgrounds and undergo comprehensive training before volunteering.\n\n\"We simply couldn't do it without them,\" Miller emphasized. \"It would be impossible. We wouldn't have the necessary manpower or resources.\"\n\nDue to a recent decline in demand for the vaccine, the clinic has been scaled down, Miller noted.  Volunteers like Dr. Dobson hope to see an increase in vaccinations soon.\n\n\"I feel for the people who aren't getting vaccinated,\" he expressed. \"I'm glad for those who are, as they're protected. But the unvaccinated population remains at risk.\"\n\nThe Clark County Combined Health District is still welcoming new volunteer applications. For more information, click here.",

He particularly praised the Pakistani American community, noting their special importance to Prime Minister Imran Khan, and credited the diaspora for achieving record foreign remittances this year.\n\n\"We envision a system where dual nationals can actively participate in elections,\" Qureshi stated.\n\nThe Foreign Minister briefed the audience on the government's economic achievements, emphasizing their success in managing the COVID-19 pandemic through strategic initiatives. He also outlined the administration's shift in foreign policy focus from geo-political to geo-economic considerations.\n\nQureshi called upon elected Pakistani Americans to strengthen bilateral relations between Pakistan and the United States through their influential positions.\n\nThis announcement follows the National Assembly's recent passage of the Election Act Amendment Bill, 2020.

In today's world, most vehicle interiors are crafted from plastic, with meticulous attention to detail eliciting admiration and making one think, \"Wow, I would pay $150,000 for that.\" Luxury sedans often lose value rapidly, much like stones, with the 2003 760i now nearly worthless in light of BMW's recent release of the impressive M760Li model. Weighing over two tons, this vehicle is a marvel, managing to be one of the world's fastest four-door cars.\n\nFor enthusiasts of large sedans, feast your eyes on this photo gallery showcasing six of the most opulent luxury sedans favored by top players in the automotive realm. Each image captures a front 3/4 view above and an interior shot below, presenting a simple yet delightful viewing experience, akin to savoring a hamburger.\n\nThe collection includes the relatively affordable Lexus LS, humorously dubbed by Doug DeMuro as \"the ultimate $120,000 sedan.\" Though the Lexus may have flaws, its design exudes a unique charm inside and out, highlighted by luxurious burgundy leather door panels that almost make you overlook its subpar infotainment system.\n\nMoving on to the 2018 Audi A8, which debuted last year with a subtle design, even by Audi's standards. Despite its reserved appearance compared to the Lexus, the dashboard's innovative twin-screen layout stands out as a remarkable technological feature. The BMW M760Li, known for its striking matte black exterior option, presents an interior reminiscent of the 5 Series.\n\nMaybach's luxurious take on the S-Class boasts a facelift model with exquisite two-tone paint, though many fail to appreciate the special allure of its interior. Similarly, the Bentley Mulsanne and the Rolls-Royce Phantom, with their intricate craftsmanship requiring countless hours to perfect, often go unnoticed.",
        "CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) \u2014 Guinea's opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they will not participate in the legislative elections scheduled for February. They intend to push for a delay unless the president withdraws his bid to seek another term. \n\nThe opposition's statement follows last year's massive demonstrations where tens of thousands urged President Alpha Cond\u00e9 not to amend the constitution to allow him a third term. At least nine people were killed during one of the protests in October. \n\nAt least five parties have declared their intent not to take part in the February 16 vote. They have also called for new demonstrations on January 13 to protest both the legislative elections and Cond\u00e9's proposed constitutional changes. \n\n\"Not only will we not participate in this election, but we will also oppose its occurrence by all legal means, as it is merely a charade,\" stated Ousmane Gaoual Diallo, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, one of the leading opposition parties. \n\n\"We cannot engage in an election that is rigged, with an electoral commission president whose actions are dictated by President Alpha Cond\u00e9,\" added Sidya Tour\u00e9 of the Union of Republican Forces, another opposition leader. \n\nDespite the opposition's declarations, Presidential adviser Souleymane Keita asserted that the vote will proceed. \n\n\"If the opposition chooses not to participate, they will face the consequences,\" he said. \"We will move forward with the elections on February 16, with or without the opposition.\" \n\nCond\u00e9's mandate concludes in December 2020, yet he seeks a referendum to enable a third term in the West African nation, which has a population of approximately 12 million. The 81-year-old Cond\u00e9 was first elected to a five-year term in 2010, marking Guinea's initial democratic transition of power since gaining independence from France in 1958. He was re-elected in 2015.",

This free, three-day event, sponsored by Aldi and run in partnership with the Yorkshire Evening Post and Leeds City Council, with support from Heart Yorkshire, promises a diverse array of global street food.\n\nHere\u2019s a taste of what to expect:\n\n**International Flavors:**\n\nNamaste India, run by Megha Mehta, Komal Patel, and Pallavi Rane, will be serving authentic Indian street food, including the popular Aamchi Mumbai Vadapav \u2013 a bread bun filled with a fried potato filling, topped with onions and a trio of sauces.  Originally from Mumbai and now a Leeds resident for eight years, Megha and her partners are excited to participate in their first major event after a successful debut at the Indian Food Festival at Kirkgate Market last September.  \"People really loved our food,\" she said. \"We are excited and looking forward to it.\"\n\nBringing Caribbean cuisine with a twist is Kirk Hewitt of Treasure Taste, travelling from Birmingham.

        "Football  \nH\u00c0 N\u1ed8I - Of the 14 teams in the V.League 1, S\u00f4ng Lam Ngh\u1ec7 An (SLNA) are the only team never to have played below the top tier. However, that unblemished record is in danger as they sit at the bottom of the table with only 10 points from 12 matches. After their 1-0 loss to Thanh H\u00f3a on Sunday, acting skipper Phan V\u0103n \u0110\u1ee9c emotionally posted on his Facebook page, calling for unity and perseverance among his teammates. The loss has placed SLNA in a precarious position, facing the risk of relegation.\n\nSLNA\u2019s recent struggles have prompted significant changes within the club. The result led to the resignation of president Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1ed3ng Thanh and coach Ng\u00f4 Quang Tr\u01b0\u1eddng last week, marking a seismic shift for the team. Despite these challenges, SLNA has a storied history, having never played below the top tier and producing many of Vi\u1ec7t Nam\u2019s biggest football talents. They have won three V.League 1 titles, three National Cup trophies, and four National Super Cups, alongside success at lower age levels.\n\nIn the past, SLNA has overcome tough situations. Their previous nightmare was in 2018 when they languished in last place but managed to bounce back with eight consecutive wins, finishing fourth. The team\u2019s worst-ever finish was last year when they placed 10th. However, the club has been struggling with financial issues, affecting their ability to retain key players and make strategic signings. Many homegrown talents like Qu\u1ebf Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ea3i, Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u1ecdng Ho\u00e0ng, Ng\u00f4 Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecbnh, and Ph\u1ea1m Kh\u1eafc Ng\u1ecdc have left the team in recent years due to financial constraints.\n\nThis year, SLNA's reliance on Vietnamese international Phan V\u0103n \u0110\u1ee9c has been evident, as he has scored five goals this season, accounting for 71 percent of the team\u2019s total goals. The team's three foreign players have contributed only two goals, leaving \u0110\u1ee9c to shoulder much of the offensive burden. Former coach Tr\u01b0\u1eddng admitted that SLNA is overly dependent on the 25-year-old, and other teams have managed to neutralize their threat by focusing on him.\n\nIn addition to financial woes, SLNA is suffering from an injury crisis. Key players like midfielder \u0110\u1eb7ng V\u0103n L\u1eafm, captain Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Kh\u00e1nh, defender Nguy\u1ec5n S\u1ef9 Nam, and striker H\u1ed3 Ph\u00fac T\u1ecbnh have been sidelined for several weeks. Despite these challenges, the team remains hopeful for a great escape as they are only three points away from S\u00e0i G\u00f2n FC in the relegation playoff spot. SLNA's first task will be to secure three points against H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i FC on Friday at home.\n\nH\u00e0 N\u1ed9i FC, currently seventh with 17 points, is also facing challenges this season, struggling defensively with 14 goals conceded. In their 25 meetings, SLNA has secured only five wins against H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i FC, alongside 10 draws and 10 defeats. Coach Nguy\u1ec5n Huy Ho\u00e0ng of SLNA expressed determination, stating, \"We must accept challenges. We are working hard and united to get through difficulties.\u201d Meanwhile, captain Kh\u00e1nh aimed to inspire his teammates on social media, asserting that \"S\u00f4ng Lam Ngh\u1ec7 An will never give up!\u201d VNS",

        "Here's a restructured version of the article with improved logical flow, organized into clear sections:\n\n# Neeraj Chopra's Journey to Tokyo Olympics: A Story of Comeback and Resilience\n\n## The Triumphant Return\nIn a remarkable comeback, Neeraj Chopra threw 87.86m at the ACNW League Meet in Potchefstroom, South Africa, qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics by clearing the 85m mark. This achievement, coming after a 1.5-year hiatus, was particularly significant - the distance exceeded the 86.89m throw that won gold at the 2019 World Championships.\n\n\"I feel proud of making a strong comeback. Participating in a competition after 1.5 years and clearing the Olympic mark gives me immense satisfaction,\" Chopra says.\n\n## The Injury Setback\nThe road to this comeback wasn't smooth. Following a stellar 2018, where he claimed gold at both Commonwealth Games and Asian Games and set a national record of 88.06 metres, Chopra began experiencing elbow pain in November 2018.\n\n\"I started feeling my injury back in November 2018. I continued to train, but was not having too many issues despite the pain. But it aggravated by April,\" he recalled. The condition worsened until he couldn't even lift a javelin, leading to surgery in May 2019.\n\n## The Rehabilitation Journey\nPost-surgery, Chopra underwent an intensive rehabilitation period, first in Mumbai and then at JSW's Inspire Institute of Sport in Bellary. He began with basic activities like cycling, gradually progressing to hand exercises and strength training.\n\n\"After surgery, I immediately started cycling, because I was unable to move my hand. Later, I started hand and strengthening exercises and slowly started gaining my strength. I kept myself motivated by setting a target for myself each day to do better than the previous day.\"\n\n## World Championships Disappointment\nDespite qualifying for the World Athletics Championships with an 83.90m throw in September 2018, Chopra had to withdraw due to his recovery. \"I had trained really hard for the World Championships. It was constantly on my mind, whenever I was at the training. But injury ki wajah se sab gadbad ho gaya,\" he explained.\n\n## The Path Forward\nWith the Olympic qualification secured, Chopra isn't resting on his laurels. He's already back in training, preparing for the Federation Cup and IAAF Diamond League in Doha in April, leading up to the Tokyo Olympics where he could become India's first track-and-field Olympic medalist since 1900.\n\n\"My target of qualifying for Tokyo is accomplished. From the next day onwards, I restarted my original training schedule. The preparations have begun for the Tokyo Olympics and for all the competitions that are on the road,\" he says.\n\n## Mental Resilience\nThroughout his recovery, Chopra maintained a positive attitude. \"Everyone told me that injuries are a part of an athlete's life'. They told me not to worry too much about time off the track and just focus on my recovery.\"\n\n\"I believed I could qualify for Tokyo because I was having a good time at the training. Everything was working out and bhaari haath chal raha tha. So, I was expecting a good comeback. But the fact that I qualified on my first attempt, it makes me really happy,\" he concluded.",
        "Usain Bolt's arrival on the Central Coast has already made a significant impact, so much so that Mariners coach Mike Mulvey would be thrilled to have the Olympic champion on board for a year if that's what it takes. Bolt's \"indefinite\" trial period with the Mariners began on Tuesday morning, amidst more hype than any A-League club has previously experienced, arguably excepting Alessandro Del Piero\u2019s arrival at Sydney FC. Yet, this story is quite different: a 32-year-old Olympic sprinter aiming to become a successful professional footballer.\n\nHe is a work in progress, as was evident from his first training session in front of the cameras in Gosford. However, Mulvey is more than willing to keep Bolt around for the next 12 months if that's necessary to develop him into a footballer. \"We\u2019re absolutely delighted that Usain has chosen our club, this great community on the Central Coast, to pursue his ambition,\" Mulvey said. \"If it takes 12 months, I'm happy for him to be here. He\u2019s already attracted the largest media presence to this area. The spotlight is on the Central Coast and the people here, and I think that's fantastic. It's all fine with me.\"\n\nAny notions of this being merely a gimmick or PR stunt are swiftly dismissed. At his age and with his achievements, Bolt could easily be relaxing on a Caribbean beach. Instead, the likable and humble Bolt is determined to succeed in a sport he has loved since childhood. It\u2019s this character strength that makes having Bolt on board a pleasure for Mulvey. \"You don't lower your standards when Usain Bolt walks in the door. This guy is a winner,\" Mulvey stated. \"Eight gold medals in the Olympics. That achievement requires not just great ability but also immense mental strength. If he can pass some of that onto my players, who are working hard to climb up from the bottom, it will be invaluable for our young lads. They\u2019re thinking, 'how far can he take me on my journey?'\"\n\nBolt's presence at training was palpable, and it would be understandable for anyone to feel nervous under such scrutiny. \"He\u2019s a fantastic athlete, and we\u2019re absolutely delighted to have him here with us,\" Mulvey added.",

Sipping a pink fruit smoothie, clad in wool socks, Cardiff sat on the floor of the small stage in the Commons corner lounge, guitar in hand. \"Everybody here has something to share,\" he announced to the dozen participants gathered before him.\n\nCardiff, a seasoned performer at the college, often incorporates workshops before his concerts.  \"Why not get the chance to connect with people?\" he explained, highlighting his belief in the power of community involvement.  He routinely conducts these sessions in schools.\n\nThe students, eager to learn from the experienced musician, embraced the opportunity. \"I really wanted to do something new,\" shared Anastasia Young, a first-year travel and tourism student, in an interview with the Times. Although not a musician herself, Young recognized the value of refining one's craft. \"We\u2019re always trying to make ourselves better in every area of our lives,\" she observed. \"So why not in writing, or in our craft?\"  She emphasized the benefit of feedback, believing that the perspectives of others can lead to \"opportunities for growth\" and collaborative projects. For Young, the presence of others in the creative process is a necessity, not a luxury.\n\nThe workshop involved small groups writing songs within a time limit set by Cardiff, culminating in performances for their peers. Among the participants were Jake Devine and Felix Ducharme, both first-year introduction to music industry arts students.  Devine, self-described as \"pretty stubborn,\" admitted he had never co-written a song before but was open to the experience.  His motivation was clear: \"I wanted to see someone else\u2019s perspective on how they write songs.\u201d  Similarly, Ducharme acknowledged his solitary writing habits but reconsidered after the workshop.  \"I don\u2019t write with people, but I think maybe I should start,\" he reflected. \"Different perspectives aren\u2019t so bad.\"\n\nCardiff expressed his hope that the workshop would foster connections beyond the session. \"We spend all our time alone then wonder why we get stuck,\" he pointed out, underscoring the advantages of collaborative songwriting.\n\nFollowing the workshop, Cardiff treated the intimate audience to a performance, his smooth voice and rhythmic fingerpicking echoing through the candlelit room.  He shared the story behind his song \"Boy Inside the Boat,\" explaining that it was inspired by the negativity he witnessed in the world\u2014deaths, terror attacks, and more.  \"There\u2019s always a surplus of bad things if we look for them,\" he remarked.",

On October 1, Netflix released the first episode of the original show 'Paik's Spirit,' featuring Jay Park and fellow hip-hop artist Loco as guests. During a meal, Loco brought up the time when Jay Park faced heavy criticism for his past remarks.\n\nIn 2009, comments Jay Park made about Korea in 2005, shortly after he began training at JYP Entertainment, were discovered on his personal social media. Written in English to a friend, they read, \"Korea is gay. I hate Koreans. I want to go back.\" These comments quickly spread online. Just three days later, Jay Park left his group, 2PM, and returned to his hometown of Seattle in the United States.\n\nReflecting on this period, Jay Park explained, \"It wasn't entirely my decision to come to Korea at first. When I was asked to join JYP Entertainment, my mom suggested I should go for our future. My family was struggling financially in Seattle, and she thought I could earn good money there.\"\n\nHe continued, \"There were many popular artists at JYP Entertainment, but I didn't know much about JYP or Korea. I went for my family. Life in Korea was very different from what I expected. It was my first time living away from my family and friends, and I had given up everything in Seattle for that. It wasn't easy for me; the cultural differences were challenging. I may have complained to my friends back in the States, and that's where those comments came from.\"\n\nJay Park added, \"After I started gaining attention as the leader of 2PM, someone dug up those comments from the social media account I no longer used, and it became an issue. People kept saying, 'Jay Park hates Korea and Koreans,' but that can't be true because my parents are Korean, and I'm Korean myself.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"Anyway, I was ignorant and thoughtless back then. I was too young, and my words came out wrong. I think I expected everyone to live like I did. I was too selfish.",

        "A woman revealed her impressive carpet transformation, taking it from cream to a stylish grey in just over an hour using \u00a31 worth of dye.  She shared her savvy technique in the Facebook group Mrs Hinch Cleaning Tips, explaining how she achieved the chic update with minimal effort.\n\n\"So, just want to say the Dylon in a spray bottle really does work,\" she wrote.  \"Brought my carpet up like new as well with all the rubbing in.... this took 1.5 hours to do and cost me a total of \u00a31 for the dye I used.\"\n\nHer method involved mixing four tablespoons of Smoke Grey Dylon fabric dye with 700ml of warm water.  She used three bottles of this mixture on her carpet.  Applying the dye with a spray bottle while wearing gloves, she left it to dry overnight and reported no color transfer the next day.\n\nHer post generated significant interest, racking up over 2,200 comments and impressing many.  \"I had no idea you can dye a carpet,\" one person admitted. Another added, \"Would never have thought of doing that, looks fab.\"\n\nThe Dylon Dye Pod fabric dye in Smoke Grey, which she used for the project, is currently available for around \u00a35.  This clever hack echoes a previous story where a woman similarly transformed her brown stairs to grey using a \u00a35 Wilko product.

During a visit to the Accra College of Education, which was hosting the Ghana Teacher Licensure Examination, he expressed concerns about the implications of reversing the progress made in aligning Ghanaian teachers with international standards.\n\nThe examination, originally scheduled for September 24 and 25, 2020, had to be rescheduled to October 1 and 2, 2020, due to changes in the academic calendar caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "Southampton's comeback from two goals down against Burnley on Sunday might have looked fortunate, but underlying data reveals they deserved the win.  Their Fantasy Premier League Threat score, which measures the quality of goalscoring chances, reached a gameweek 30 high of 352.  Danny Ings' individual Threat of 122 was second only to Harry Kane (126) and nearly matched Burnley's entire team total (125).  A deeper dive into the week's statistics can inform your fantasy strategy.\n\n**Threatening Heights:**\n\n* Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) GW1 - 161\n* Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton) GW2 - 144\n* Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa) GW15 - 140\n* Harry Kane (Tottenham) GW3 - 138\n* Harry Kane (Tottenham) GW30 - 126\n\n\nKane and Ings' triple-digit Threat totals represent only the 22nd and 23rd instances of a player reaching 100 in a single match this season. Ings shattered his previous best of 82, while Kane, who also boasts a 138 from gameweek three, now holds two of the season\u2019s top five Threat scores. Ings' performance ranks seventh.  With Tottenham's double gameweek in 32 approaching, overlooking the England captain seems incredibly risky.\n\n**Spurs' Defensive Deficiencies:**\n\nDespite Kane's attacking prowess, Southampton, along with Newcastle, dominated the Threat metric in gameweek 30.  Newcastle, surprisingly, generated the second-highest Threat total of the week (338), comfortably their best this season and only the third time they've surpassed 200. While Dwight Gayle led Newcastle with 78, their challenging upcoming fixtures suggest avoiding Tottenham defenders might be wise.\n\n**James's Creative Spark:**\n\nChelsea's heavy defeat to West Brom offered little solace, but Reece James shone with a league-leading Creativity score of 66.  Creativity, which measures the potential of passes to become assists, mirrors Threat for goals.  A defender topping this metric is significant.  Chelsea, despite playing with 10 men, were one of two teams to generate more Threat than their opponents but still lose.\n\n**Wolves' Emerging Opportunity:**\n\nWolves, the other team to out-Threat their opponents in a losing effort, appeared to have West Ham's number despite a slow start.",

        "Chris Paul, known more famously as \"CP3\", has always been regarded as one of the top point guards in the league. Even though he had a brilliant season with OKC Thunder, it is widely reported that Chris Paul is expected to move this offseason to one of the multiple teams desperately looking for an elite point guard. NBA Trade Rumors: Chris Paul wants to play in a big market franchise, preferably New York or Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Macri of the Knicks Film School, Chris Paul wants to play in a big market again next season, with Los Angeles and New York on the top of his list. With Chris Paul's heart set on playing in either Los Angeles or New York, fans of the four franchises in those cities have reason to be optimistic about landing an elite player this offseason. Paul has proved his worth time and again, with his basketball IQ and superior playmaking skills valued around the league by GMs and Head Coaches.\n\nAfter the 2018-19 season, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded Russell Westbrook for Chris Paul, and analysts gave them a 0.2% chance of making the playoffs. However, Chris Paul's inspiring leadership led the young group of talented players to a Game 7 in the first round of the NBA playoffs, beating all odds.\n\nLooking at the possibilities, let's evaluate each team on the top of Paul's list. Starting with the LA Lakers, despite trade rumors linking Chris Paul to the franchise, it seems like an unlikely destination due to his massive contract. The LA Clippers, on the other hand, would love to have Paul on board, but they would also struggle to make room for his contract after their previous moves.\n\nOn the east coast, NBA Trade Rumors have linked the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets to various stars. The Brooklyn Nets already have a premier point guard in Kyrie Irving, making it unlikely for them to trade for Paul. This leaves the New York Knicks as a potential destination, with ample cap space and a desperate need for a point guard, making them a viable option for Chris Paul.\n\nIn conclusion, with next season fast approaching, teams around the NBA are looking to add quality to their rosters. Chris Paul has dominated the NBA Trade Rumors recently, and his desire to play in a big market franchise like New York or Los Angeles adds intrigue to the offseason negotiations.",

        "Car-buying consumers are at great risk after weather events like Hurricane Harvey and the threat posed by Hurricane Irma. They're at risk that flooded vehicles will eventually flood the market. The late Tom Zimmer, a former National Insurance Crime Bureau investigator and long-time source of mine, demonstrated for me three years ago how states will print salvage titles in the insurance companies' names -- and in a different color. \"A regular Tennessee title is going to be green,\" he demonstrated. \"Notice how the (Tennessee salvage title) is blue.\"\n\nBy law, when a flood drowns cars on a retail or auction lot, the lot must total out those vehicles in coordination with its insurance company and brand those cars' titles as salvage titles in the name of the insurance company. It also takes days, even weeks to secure a salvage title on a flooded vehicle. There's the flood itself, then the waiting to get a claims adjuster out to conduct an inspection, then the determination of loss and liability, then the generation of the title. \"There's a gap of time between the actual incident and the branding of the title, so basically, you are unprotected at that point until those titles are branded,\" said Stan Norton, managing partner of City Auto and dealer member of the Tennessee Motor Vehicle Commission.\n\nBottom line, you should never buy a car without proof of a clean title. Period. If you insist on taking the risk of considering a car that has either a salvage title or no title at all, Zimmer said use your eyes -- and your nose -- to determine if it may be a flooded vehicle. \"Are there artificial air fresheners in there that are probably covering up the odor of mold?\" he said. He also said look for sand, dirt or silt traces in the upholstery, on the floorboard and around the interior. Chris Basso, public relations director for Carfax vehicle history reports, recommended before purchasing the car, have a reliable mechanic inspect the trunk, engine, and spare tire well for water or debris. Look for condensation in the dashboard, headlights, and taillights -- and look for excess rust on interior metal parts.\n\nAndy Wise walks you through the steps of filing a flooded vehicle claim, as long as you have comprehensive coverage. \"You should rely on vehicle history reports, and you should absolutely get those,\" Norton said.",
        "As part of the 20th-anniversary celebrations of his ascension to the Golden Stool, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II was honored with a state banquet in Kumasi, hosted by President Akufo-Addo. Held last Friday at the Ashanti Regional Coordinating Council (RCC), the event attracted numerous dignitaries, all adhering to a strict dress code.\n\nThe banquet was punctuated by memorable moments, including a dance between Otumfuo and First Lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo, which drew enthusiastic applause.  Nearby, President Akufo-Addo danced with Lady Julia Osei Tutu, the wife of the Asantehene. Former First Lady Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings also graced the dance floor, showcasing her impressive footwork.  Highlife legend Abrante Amakye Dede captivated the audience with a stellar performance.\n\nIn a brief speech, President Akufo-Addo eulogized Otumfuo, highlighting his contributions to Ghana's political and socio-economic growth.  Describing the Asantehene as a good friend of 40 years, the President lauded Otumfuo's instrumental role in resolving the Dagbon chieftaincy dispute. He praised his work as chairperson of the Committee of Eminent Chiefs, alongside Nayiri, the Overlord of Mamprugu, and Yogbonwura, the Overlord of the Gonja state, in achieving a lasting peace.  The President further commended Otumfuo's achievements in education through the Otumfuo Education Fund, his efforts in combating HIV/AIDS, and his revitalization of the institution of chieftaincy.

He expressed his appreciation for the state banquet and affirmed Asanteman's continued commitment to national transformation.  Pledging his collaboration with the President for the development of the country, particularly within his kingdom, Otumfuo painted a poignant picture of the challenges facing the Ashanti Region: \"You walk alone on this path and you are struck by the picture of an old lady in the twilight of her years in decline of seeming neglect and a picture of despair. Sadly this picture is not exclusive but a reflection of the challenges confronting the people in the Ashanti Region.\u201d He then challenged the President and the nation: \u201cMr. President this is a challenge we must face together.

They've transformed an ordinary parking garage into an extraordinary 700-square-foot home for a family of four, proving that innovative design can triumph over spatial constraints.\n\n## Preserving Heritage While Embracing Modernity\n\nThe designers made the bold choice to retain key architectural elements of the original structure\u2014exposed concrete beams, ramps, and vaults\u2014lending authenticity and character to the space. Their primary challenge lay in maximizing natural light, as the structure originally featured just a single wall of windows.\n\n## Ingenious Storage Solutions\n\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of this transformation is the integration of nearly 70 cleverly concealed storage spaces within the walls, ceilings, and floors. Storage corridors line the entrance and hallway between living areas and bedrooms, ensuring every square inch serves a purpose.\n\nAs Pelc\u00e9 explains, \"With a single contribution of natural light from the windowed facade facing street, the apartment is designed to be 'turned' toward this light with its glass rooms. Elements holding the old garage function were kept as witnesses and graphic structures of the apartment.\"\n\n## Custom-Crafted Interiors\n\nLocal artisans collaborated with Atelier Pelpell to create 80% of the apartment's furniture. Highlights include:\n- A kitchen island featuring a built-in extendable dining table\n- A space-saving curved sliding door for the master bedroom\n- Bedrooms oriented toward the window wall to maximize natural light\n- A multi-functional children's alcove that doubles as toy storage\n- A mezzanine loft accessible by ladder, featuring both double and single beds\n\n## Thoughtful Details\n\nThe bathroom showcases a sophisticated blend of colored glass and black tiles, accommodating both a generous bathtub and shower. Select pieces from prestigious brands complement the custom furnishings:\n- Press Citron shelving in the living room\n- TOGO sofas from Ligne Roset\n- A statement yellow chair by Desormeaux-Carrette\n- BALLROOM lamps from NORDKRAFT\n- Elegant wallpaper by Belgian brand Tenue de Ville\n\nThis transformation stands as a testament to the power of innovative design, proving that with vision and creativity, even the most utilitarian spaces can become extraordinary homes.",

Leigh [Whannell]'s decision to tell an origin story and go back in time is brilliant, rather than simply continuing forward with another family encountering demons.

Since this takes place six years before the first 'Insidious,' there's potential for Chapter 4.\"\n\n**Scott:** \"I would absolutely return! Though I'm not sure how much more Quinn can endure, I'd break both arms again\u2014I'm that eager to do it!\"\n\n**Q: Were you horror fans before joining 'Insidious'?**\n\n**Scott:** \"Absolutely! I love horror movies, haunted attractions, 'The Shining,' and especially the first two 'Insidious' films. Like many teenagers, I'd go see them with friends on Friday nights.\"\n\n**Mulroney:** \"As a father of a teenager, I often find myself driving groups of kids to midnight showings of horror films.

        "Here's the restructured text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n(JTA) \u2014 A medical group that caters to Orthodox women in Brooklyn has finally won the right to operate their own ambulance after years of advocacy. On Thursday, New York State's Regional Emergency Medical Services Council granted an ambulance permit to Ezras Nashim, whose name carries dual meaning - literally translating to \"women's aid\" while also referring to the women's section in Orthodox synagogues.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Orthodox women in Brooklyn, Ezras Nashim serves as a counterpart to Hatzoloh, a long-established emergency services organization staffed predominantly by men. The women's group was created to better serve religious women who, for modesty reasons, might prefer treatment from female medical staff.\n\nAmong the organization's founders is Judge Ruchie Freier, who holds the distinction of being the first Orthodox Hasidic woman elected to public office in America. Her daughter, Leah Freier Levine, serves as the group's director of outreach and development.\n\n\"We hope this is the end of the long journey,\" Freier Levine told the Forward, which first reported news of the permit.",

The initiative will mobilize volunteers from more than 500 organizations across the province to help identify invasive species in Ontario's lakes.\n\n\"Volunteers will be collecting and analyzing water samples on lakes and shorelines,\" explained Rebecca Schroeder, Aquatic Invasive Species liaison. \"They will then be sending them back to us where we analyze them for presence or absence of invasive mussel veligers.\" This proactive approach will help the Centre protect watersheds throughout the province.\n\nThe Federation of Ontario Cottagers' Association will coordinate the volunteer efforts. Terry Rees, the organization's executive director, emphasized the unique role of volunteers: \"Each of them has got a unique opportunity to be eyes and ears on the water and look out for our environment.\"\n\nWhile invasive mussels remain a concern across Ontario, the program will initially focus on 25 lakes from three watersheds. A key component of the initiative is raising public awareness, particularly among boaters who use multiple lakes.\n\n\"It means everyone who moves a boat from one waterbody to another has an opportunity to do their part to ensure they're not moving any water from one waterbody to another,\" Rees noted.",
        "Gerald B\u00e4ck, founder of the personal search engine Archify, announced an investment from Balderton Capital at the re:publica conference in Berlin. The venture capital firm acquired a 20 percent stake in the young company, joining a portfolio that includes game supplier Wooga, location service SCVNGR, online game Habbo, and Airbnb competitor Housetrip.  This investment followed Archify's decision to relocate its operations from Vienna to the German capital.\n\nB\u00e4ck explained to futurezone that the move was driven by several factors.  \"In Vienna there are few people with the necessary skills, in Berlin there are more people who potentially fit the job,\" he stated.  Additionally, he cited Berlin's growing influence in the internet sector, particularly its focus on the US market, which is Archify's target audience.  The exorbitant real estate prices in London, another potential relocation option, further solidified the decision in favor of Berlin.  B\u00e4ck also revealed that attending a start-up boot camp in Copenhagen cemented the realization that remaining in Vienna was not a viable option for the company's growth. While the five-person team plans to transition to Berlin, B\u00e4ck intends to initially commute between the Austrian and German capitals.\n\nArchify is developing a personal search engine designed to complement Google.  B\u00e4ck explained, \"Google is great for searching for information you don't yet know.\" Archify, however, focuses on searching an individual's own digital history, including social networks and browsing activity.  The platform currently boasts 5,000 registered users, with 3,000 active users, 80 percent of whom engage with Archify daily.\n\nThe platform offers a browser plug-in that saves all visited websites to a separate account.  It also integrates with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, archiving posted content for future searches.  Gmail integration is planned for the next development phase. Unlike tools like Evernote and Delicious, Archify automates the recording of internet usage, eliminating the need for manual saving. B\u00e4ck identifies CloudMagic and Greplin as direct competitors but believes Archify's automated browsing history feature gives it a competitive edge.",
        "Will WhatsApp Start Charging? Strong Rumors Surface | Instagram\n\nWhatsApp, the renowned messaging app, has been a hot topic of discussion in recent months due to its controversial new policies. While the Internet offers endless possibilities, it is important to be cautious of misinformation designed to incite panic for personal gain.\n\nToday, we address the persistent rumor surrounding WhatsApp potentially transitioning to a paid model, with speculations about charging for each message or introducing a premium version with a blue interface. Rest assured, these claims are mere hoaxes.\n\nThe recent uproar stemmed from WhatsApp's announcement of changes to its privacy policy, sparking widespread media coverage and user skepticism. Consequently, various unfounded rumors have gained traction, circulating across online platforms and within WhatsApp conversations.\n\nSome misleading messages urge users to forward a particular text to ten people or click on a link to avoid impending charges for WhatsApp services. Unfortunately, individuals falling for these scams risk exposing their personal information to potential fraudsters.\n\nIn reality, WhatsApp has no plans to impose fees for messaging or change its current payment structure. The company is unlikely to revert to its previous subscription-based model anytime soon.\n\nFurthermore, beware of another prevalent hoax promoting \"WhatsApp Plus\" or a premium blue version promising enhanced features. These deceptive messages often lead users to click on malicious links, putting their devices and data security at risk.\n\nTo safeguard yourself, exercise caution with forwarded messages promising unrealistic benefits or alterations not officially communicated by WhatsApp. Remember, paid WhatsApp and a blue-themed premium version are far from becoming a reality.\n\nStay vigilant, and don't fall for these deceptive schemes circulating on the platform.

Lloyd's believes there is a serious possibility that several key firms, tired of the uncertainty, may decide to relocate. Lloyd\u2019s chairman John Nelson expressed these fears strongly before the referendum, and nothing has occurred since to change his perspective.\n\nThis serves as a timely reminder, amid the hype surrounding recent positive reports on the UK\u2019s current economic performance, that Brexit is a long-term issue.

Two decades ago, Lloyd\u2019s pulled off the greatest recovery act in the history of the City when its members voted in favor of a recovery plan that saved it from extinction.\n\nThe problem that brought Lloyd\u2019s to its knees was the underwriting of open-ended commitments to insure pollution and asbestosis liabilities in the US without a full understanding of the risks.

The construction was necessitated by an enrollment spike of more than 200 kids over just a couple of years.\n\nAccording to Wilson, this put the district in an awkward position. They weren't big enough to support two full elementary schools, but their existing facilities were overcrowded. As a result, the previous elementary school (now the intermediate school) could only accommodate students up to the fourth grade, forcing fifth graders to attend classes with middle-school teenagers.\n\n\"We never really like having the fifth graders at the middle school, but we did it out of necessity,\" Wilson said. \"Building the new school gave us an opportunity to bring them back into a more appropriate age group.\"\n\n## Innovative Design\n\nThe district chose a pod floor plan that separates each grade level into different hallways. This layout limits traffic from other grades and fosters collaboration between teachers and students. Each pod includes collaboration spaces, allowing teachers to utilize an open classroom setup, employ technology, or coordinate small group projects.",

        "Traffic safety experts have tried various strategies to combat speeding, as speeding-related crashes claim around 12,000 American lives annually. Initially, they attempted flashing signs to alert drivers of their speed, believing that drivers would slow down if they were aware of their speed. When this method proved ineffective, they deployed law enforcement officers to deter speeding, emphasizing the deterrent effect of severe penalties for speeding violations. Subsequently, hidden speeding cameras were installed on major roads to encourage cautious driving by creating uncertainty about when drivers were being monitored.\n\nThe latest approach in the ongoing battle against speeding involves placing a GPS device inside cars to incentivize drivers to maintain safe speeds. Researchers have discovered that a GPS device that monitors a vehicle's speed relative to the posted speed limit, coupled with a financial incentive, effectively reduces speeding behavior. In a study supported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers were offered a $25 reward each week for safe driving, with penalties deducted for exceeding speed limits.\n\nThe experiment demonstrated significant reductions in speeding violations, particularly for drivers exceeding speed limits by nine or more miles per hour. The combination of rewards for safe driving and penalties for speeding violations proved highly effective in modifying driver behavior. The study revealed that some drivers even turned the incentive system into a personal challenge, further motivating them to comply with speed limits.\n\nThe success of this incentive-based approach suggests potential applications beyond research studies. Ian Reagan, a traffic safety researcher, envisions insurance companies offering similar tracking devices to policyholders interested in reducing their premiums. Unlike current rebate programs, these devices would provide real-time feedback to drivers, informing them of the financial implications of their driving behavior after each trip.\n\nIn conclusion, this innovative method of using incentives to promote safe driving behavior represents a promising advancement in traffic safety initiatives. By combining rewards and penalties, authorities aim to encourage drivers to adhere to speed limits and reduce the risk of speeding-related accidents. The evolving landscape of traffic safety strategies may soon see widespread adoption of such incentive-based programs by insurance companies and other stakeholders.",

A detailed order is forthcoming.\n\nThe NGT's clarification came after it had declared the shrine a \"silence zone\" on Wednesday, prohibiting religious offerings beyond the entry point.  The tribunal had previously suggested that establishing a \"silence zone\" around the shrine could help prevent avalanches and preserve the area's pristine environment.\n\nThe Amarnath cave shrine is a major Hindu pilgrimage site.  Covered in snow for most of the year, the cave is accessible to pilgrims only for a brief period during the summer.\n\nThe Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a Hindu right-wing organization, protested the NGT's initial order, calling it a \"Tughlaki fatwa\" (whimsical decree) and arguing that Hindus were not responsible for all ecological problems.\n\nConversely, environmental activist Gauri Maulekhi, whose petition led to the NGT's directions, welcomed the original order as \"good and progressive.\"  She told PTI on Wednesday, \"The Amarnath cave is situated in a fragile ecosystem.

Ultimately, the county chose not to press charges against Leipert despite a 21-year-old Caseville man accusing him of molestation.\n\nThe Diocese informed the Tribune this week that this complaint prompted Leipert's removal from the ministry in 2001.

        "The media's portrayal of Chris Watts, the man accused of murdering his pregnant wife and two young daughters, is deeply disturbing.  Articles often feature smiling family photos and headlines painting him as a devoted family man, a stark contrast to the horrific crimes he is charged with. This portrayal is problematic, to say the least.\n\nWatts, 33, allegedly murdered his 15-weeks-pregnant wife, Shanann, and their daughters, 4-year-old Bella and 3-year-old Celeste, while reportedly having an affair with a co-worker. Yet, his mugshot is rarely the featured image. Instead, media outlets often use photos from Shanann's Facebook account, seemingly capitalizing on the relatable image of a happy family to attract clicks.  Is this an attempt to draw readers in by playing on the dissonance between the image and the horrific reality?\n\nThis preferential treatment is even more unsettling when compared to media portrayals of other cases, as Shaun King highlighted.  He pointed out the lack of humanizing coverage given to a father who sought vigilante justice for his daughter, a rape victim, compared to the sympathetic portrayal sometimes afforded to Watts.  This disparity raises serious questions about the influence of \"white privilege\" in media narratives.\n\nWe are not alone in our concern.  A quick search online reveals widespread criticism of this biased portrayal.  We must call for change and hold the media accountable. When we see this type of inequitable representation, we need to point it out and demand better.  Using a smiling family photo and quotes from acquaintances describing Watts as a devoted father, like those featured in a recent People Magazine article,  only serves to obscure the horrific nature of his alleged crimes.  Quotes like, \u201cIt\u2019s beyond belief, really\u2026 I never saw this coming,\u201d from Kris Landon, further perpetuate this misleading image.",

        "Iran announced the successful launch of its military satellite, dubbed Nour (Light), into orbit. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed the launch from the Markazi desert, a vast expanse in Iran's central plateau, using the Qassed two-stage launcher.  The satellite achieved an orbit of 425 kilometers (264 miles) and represents, according to Iranian sources, \"a great success and a new development in the field of space for Islamic Iran.\"\n\nThis successful launch comes after a failed attempt to put the Zafar (Victory) satellite into orbit on February 9, just days before the 41st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.  Iran maintains that neither satellite has a military purpose.  However, the United States has previously expressed concerns about Iran's satellite program, arguing that carrier rocket launches, like the one in January 2019, violate limitations on ballistic missile development. Iran insists its aerospace activities are peaceful and adhere to UN Security Council resolutions, reiterating it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons.\n\nThis latest launch occurs against a backdrop of escalating tensions between Tehran and Washington.  The long-standing animosity worsened in 2018 when President Trump withdrew the US from the nuclear deal and imposed new demands regarding Iran's ballistic missile program.  Tensions further intensified after the US drone strike in January that killed Major General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force.\n\nAdding to the existing friction, Iran accuses the US of \"economic terrorism\" through sanctions, claiming these measures hinder access to vital medicines and equipment needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.  Officially, Iran reports nearly 5,300 deaths and almost 85,000 infections since the outbreak began on February 19, though these figures are widely believed to underrepresent the true impact of the virus.",

This is the rationale behind today's decisions by the government.\"\n\nThe prime minister acknowledged that these restrictions would impact the economy but emphasized, \"There is no economy without health, nor good customers without healthy citizens.\"\n\nThis announcement follows a report from Greek authorities of 1,526 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, more than double the previous day's count, with over half originating from the Attica region.

        "Opioid use during pregnancy has risen dramatically, prompting new guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) aimed at improving care for affected women and newborns.  According to the CDC, 7% of U.S. women reported using prescription opioids during pregnancy in 2019, with one in five of those women misusing the drugs. By some estimates, nearly 80 infants born with opioid withdrawal are diagnosed daily in the U.S., a number that has tripled in recent years.\n\nThese infants can experience symptoms such as tremors, fussiness, and diarrhea, and may be at risk for developmental delays, though other factors like alcohol use, poor prenatal care, or stress could also contribute, according to Dr. Stephen Patrick, lead author of the AAP report.\n\nThe new guidelines, released Monday, address the critical need for consistent and effective care.  \u201cWhile we have been talking about the opioid crisis for years, pregnant women and their newborns seldom make it to the top of the heap,\u201d said Patrick, a Vanderbilt University pediatrician. \u201cInfants are receiving variable care and not getting connected to services.\u201d\n\nThe AAP recommends that pregnant women with opioid addiction have access to medication-assisted treatment.  Two opioids, buprenorphine and methadone, are effective, but pregnant women often face stigma when using them, and prescribing doctors are scarce.  Furthermore, hospitals should have written protocols for assessing and treating opioid-affected newborns, a practice currently lacking in many facilities.\n\nThe AAP also emphasizes the importance of breastfeeding and other bonding practices, along with parent education and referrals to support services for affected newborns. These recommendations echo guidance from other medical groups and the U.S. government.\n\nThe pandemic may be exacerbating the problem, making access to treatment even more difficult.  \"Getting into treatment may be getting even harder,\" Patrick said.",

They all claim that the public accepts violations of human rights as supposedly necessary to secure jobs, avoid cultural change, or prevent terrorist attacks,\" he added.\n\nThe report highlights how President-elect Trump's campaign embodied this politics of intolerance, addressing Americans' economic frustrations and security fears by proposing controversial policies, including:\n- Mass deportation of undocumented immigrants\n- Creation of a Muslim registry\n- Use of torture\n\nIf enacted, these proposals risk not only violating human rights but also undermining the entire human rights protection system.\n\nEuropean leaders have exhibited similar populist tendencies. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted that the UK's Brexit campaign employed \"divisive, anti-immigrant and xenophobic rhetoric,\" prompting calls for officials to reject such discourse.\n\nDespite some progress in relocating asylum seekers, British Prime Minister Theresa May maintained an anti-rights stance, criticizing \"activist left-wing human rights lawyers\" and seeking to exempt UK forces abroad from human rights law.\n\nHuman Rights Watch emphasized that undermining rights for some threatens rights for all. \"You may not like your neighbors, but if you sacrifice their rights today, you jeopardize your own tomorrow,\" Roth cautioned. \"In fact, disregard for human rights offers the likeliest route to tyranny.\"\n\nThe rise of Western populism and muted response to violations has emboldened leaders worldwide:\n\n- China's Xi Jinping has led an unprecedented crackdown on dissent\n- Turkey's Erdo\u011fan has crushed political and media opposition\n- Burundi's Nkurunziza announced withdrawal from the International Criminal Court\n- Syria's Assad and Saudi Arabia's Mohammad Bin Salman continue civilian attacks with apparent impunity\n\nAkshaya Kumar, Human Rights Watch's Deputy UN Director, noted that populist leaders now embrace rather than shy away from anti-rights rhetoric. Examples include:\n\n- Hungary's Viktor Orb\u00e1n's open Islamophobia and anti-refugee policies\n- Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte's explicit endorsement of extrajudicial killings\n\nTo combat these trends, Kumar advocates targeting enablers of rights abuses, including financial backers and arms suppliers. Recent successes include Canada's 2006 prohibition of LTTE fundraising and the U.S.'s 2016 suspension of arms sales to Philippine police.\n\nThe report emphasizes the crucial role of civil society organizations, media, and governments in defending human rights, particularly as some leaders \"buried their heads in the sand, hoping the winds of populism will blow over.\"\n\nUltimately, the public bears responsibility for addressing populism and promoting human rights. As Roth concluded, \"Values are fragile... A society's culture of respect for human rights needs regular tending, lest the fears of the moment sweep away the wisdom that built democratic rule.\"",

        "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The latest on Canada's parliamentary elections (all times local):\n\n9 a.m.\nCanadians are electing a new Parliament on Monday following a tight election campaign that has raised the threat of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau being knocked from power after one term. The 47-year-old Trudeau channeled the star power of his father, the liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, when he won in 2015. However, a combination of scandal and high expectations have damaged his prospects. Polls indicate Trudeau's Liberal Party could lose to the rival Conservatives, or perhaps win but still fail to secure a majority of seats in Parliament, forcing them to rely on an opposition party to remain in power. It has been 84 years since a first-term Canadian prime minister with a parliamentary majority lost a bid for re-election.\n\n7:05 p.m.\nPolls have closed in Canada's Atlantic Coast province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the results of Canada's federal election will now start to trickle in. Canadians are electing a new Parliament after a contentious election campaign that has put Trudeau's leadership at risk after just one term. The 47-year-old Trudeau, who rode the wave of his father's legacy to victory in 2015, now faces a challenging political landscape.\n\n7:40 p.m.\nPolls in Atlantic Canada are closing in a federal election that could potentially unseat Justin Trudeau and his Liberal party from power. Trudeau had previously won every seat in Atlantic Canada in 2015, marking the beginning of a wave that helped him secure a majority of seats in Parliament. With polling stations in Newfoundland having already closed, the polls are now closing in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. Trudeau's initial success, driven by the star power of his father's legacy, has been overshadowed by scandals and unmet expectations.",
        "Rainy Roth, a children\u2019s ministry leader in her Montana church, volunteers as a crisis counselor with Crisis Text Line.  From her computer in a small town (population 943), she connects with people, primarily under 25, who are struggling with a variety of issues. This work, she finds, intertwines with her role at church, as both involve supporting and nurturing young people.\n\nAs a crisis counselor, Rainy completed a rigorous 34-hour training program, covering topics from active listening techniques to dealing with self-harm, suicide, depression, bullying, and gender/sexual identity.  This prepared her for the challenging but rewarding work ahead.\n\nRainy\u2019s motivation stems partly from her own childhood experience with undiagnosed anxiety.  In the 1960s, mental health awareness was limited, and her struggles were misunderstood.  Now, she finds solace in being able to tell someone, \u201cI get it,\u201d offering understanding and validation she lacked as a child.\n\nWhile she helps texters with various challenges, Rainy finds the \u201cactive rescues\u201d \u2013 intervening when someone expresses imminent plans to harm themselves or others \u2013 particularly impactful.  Knowing she played a role in getting someone immediate help is profoundly rewarding. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about saving lives,\u201d she explains, \u201cit\u2019s also about letting these individuals know that people care.\u201d\n\nA simple phrase, \u201cYou matter,\u201d carries surprising weight for many texters.  Rainy frequently hears, \u201cWow, I have never heard that before!\u201d  These two words offer reassurance and a sense of belonging, countering negative thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe connection she forms with texters is deeply fulfilling.  Hearing them acknowledge her words brings a sense of comfort and, in a way, heals a part of herself that struggled for so long with unnamed fear and anxiety.  Being able to identify with their experiences allows her to help them understand that their feelings are valid and that there is hope for change.\n\nRainy believes she has become a better and healthier person through her work as a crisis counselor.  Her compassion, combined with the skills she gained through training, allows her to offer support and reassurance, letting those in crisis know that things will ultimately be okay.\n\n* * *\n\n_This essay is part of an occasional series provided by our partner organization Encore.org, which created the Generation to Generation (Gen2Gen) campaign \u2013 inviting those in midlife and beyond to connect with kids who need champions._\n\nFor more, visit crisistextline.org.",
        "The Union Minister of State for Education, Subhas Sarkar, informed the Rajya Sabha on November 22 that there are currently 3,900 vacant teaching posts and over 3,000 ad-hoc teachers working in colleges affiliated with the University of Delhi. The issue of ad-hoc teachers has been a prominent one in nearly every movement led by the DU Teachers' Association in recent years but has yet to be resolved.\n\nIn response to a question raised in the Lok Sabha in August, the government stated that there were only 58 ad-hoc teachers at DU. So, how did the number suddenly escalate to 3,000? Well, the data provided in August was specific to the university departments and did not include the affiliated colleges. However, Dr. Shabana Azmi, an ad-hoc teacher of Political Science at Zakir Husain College, contested this figure during the recent DUTA elections, claiming that, according to electoral rolls, there are more than 4,000 ad-hoc teachers. She emphasized the need to scrutinize how the government arrived at their count.\n\nAd-hoc teachers have long been advocating for absorption, with support from the left-led DUTA, though Dr. Azmi believes more action is required. She expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of significant support from teachers' groups and criticized the way the issue was sidelined during a recent Executive Council meeting. Dr. Azmi, a member of the Adhoc Teachers Front (ATF), highlighted the disparity in treatment compared to permanent faculty members who receive promotions while ad-hoc teachers face uncertainty.\n\nAd-hoc teachers now hesitate to participate in interviews due to reported instances of displacement for newer recruits. They also raised concerns about the requirement of a PhD for appointments, stressing that many ad-hoc teachers have been unable to complete their doctorate due to job commitments. Dr. Azmi questioned the sudden change in qualification criteria from a Master's degree to a PhD.\n\nTo address these grievances, ad-hoc teachers plan to engage with DUTA, relevant officials, and the Education Ministry before considering a full-fledged protest, similar to that of 2019. Dr. Azmi mentioned that newly elected DUTA President, Dr. AK Bhagi, promised to champion the cause of ad-hoc teachers. If dialogue fails to yield results, ad-hoc teachers are prepared to take to the streets, with the support of permanent faculty members.\n\nDUTA witnessed a significant change with the election of Dr. AK Bhagi from the RSS-affiliated National Democratic Teachers Front as the DUTA President. Dr. Bhagi highlighted some progress in efforts to absorb ad-hoc teachers, citing small victories such as maternity leave entitlements for ad-hoc teachers. He identified this issue alongside the demand for salaries for teachers in 12 DU colleges under the Delhi government as critical agendas for DUTA.",

        "SAFETY concerns are being brushed aside at mine sites as workers strive to reach coal production targets and bonuses. Workers are also failing to learn and follow the extensive regulations as they adopt a \"bull at a gate\" mentality to production. The explosive claims were from Oaky North site safety and health representative Joe Barber at the Queensland Coal Mining Board of Inquiry this week.\n\nMr Barber told the inquiry he believed workers not knowing the regulations was an issue, and suggested more active training was needed. \"They (workers) don't know the regulations. They don't know the Act,\" Mr Barber said. \"I don't know it fully, either. I suppose it's not that they don't really care, but they just - they just - they sometimes go a bit bull at a gate.\"\n\nMr Barber said the regulations could be broken down into \"major ones that certain people need to know about\". As an example, Mr Barber recalled a situation when an electrician turned off a fan without safety oversight in the section in a development panel. \"You can't do that, there's that much gas in there,\" he said. \" \u2026 He got hauled over the coals for it.\n\n\"I witnessed him talking to someone that he didn't really think that he'd done anything wrong. So then I pulled the extraction out of the regs and took it to him and showed him his obligations and said that if I ever found him doing that again, I would personally take him to the SSE. That's where they don't - a young bloke in the industry and just had no regard for it at all and didn't know what was - there was gas build-up in the stubs there.\"\n\nOn being asked \"how big a problem\" it was, Mr Barber replied: \"I think it's a big problem. I don't know whether it's - you can train people. You know, you can give them as much training as you want to, but they've got to - it is a problem. \"We've got such a big workforce, and the push to get the coal out, you know, like, 'she'll be right, mate. Let's just keep going'.\"",

(REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann)\n\nHONG KONG\u2014China Inc. will continue acquiring foreign companies with strategic value, despite efforts to control significant capital outflows. ChemChina's acquisition of Syngenta, listed as SYNN.VX, exemplifies this trend.\n\nState-owned ChemChina agreed on Wednesday to a $43 billion bid for the Swiss seeds and pesticides group. This marks the largest overseas deal by a Chinese firm and is equivalent, by itself, to one-third of all foreign acquisitions by Chinese companies last year. \n\nThe landmark acquisition occurs amid record-high M&A activity and as China grapples with reversing currency outflows that undermine its yuan currency and deplete foreign exchange reserves. However, bankers and industry experts anticipate more deals, as Beijing aims for a strategic long-term shift from low-value manufacturing to high-growth production.\n\nSyngenta represents a prime example, as the acquisition will grant China immediate global leadership in the high-tech GMO segment of the agricultural sector. \"In the medium to long term, we will see more M&A activity as China aims to become more globally relevant,\" said Oliver Barron, senior China analyst at China-focused investment bank NSBO. He noted that yuan policy and concerns over outflows might slow M&A activity in the next few months compared to last year.\n\n\"Some Chinese companies have faced restrictions in purchasing foreign exchange (FX). Against such a backdrop, the Syngenta acquisition is a strategic priority with support from the top,\" Barron added.\n\n**'GOING OUT'**\n\nChina's 'Going Out' strategy has been in place for several years as Beijing seeks to build global champions.

        "Today, the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC) approved the release of the Report on Virginia\u2019s 3% Cap on the Growth in Operating Assistance Payments to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to the Virginia General Assembly, as mandated by law.\n\nIn 2018, the General Assembly established a 3% cap on the growth of Virginia\u2019s annual operating subsidy to WMATA. This measure was part of Virginia's commitment to providing a dedicated source of capital funding. If, in any given year, the approved WMATA operating subsidy increase for Virginia surpasses 3% (excluding legislative exemptions), the legislation requires the Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) to withhold 35% of the state funding allocated to NVTC. This funding serves as capital and operating assistance to help local jurisdictions meet their financial commitments to WMATA. In 2020, the General Assembly directed the formation of NVTC\u2019s 3% Cap Working Group to examine the cap's effectiveness and consider whether additional exemptions should be included.\n\nThe NVTC\u2019s 3% Cap Working Group, consisting of experts and stakeholders from Northern Virginia\u2019s localities, determined that the 3% cap is a useful tool for managing the growth of Virginia\u2019s operating subsidy. With only two years of WMATA budget development since the cap's implementation, the Working Group recommends the following:\n\n- No changes should be made to the existing 3% cap legislation at this time.\n- No additional exclusions should be considered.\n- NVTC should collaborate with the Department of Rail and Public Transportation to clarify existing state policy guidance regarding the current legislative exclusions to the cap.\n- NVTC should continue to explore potential modifications to Virginia\u2019s 3% cap legislation, with the scope and timing of such efforts to be determined by the Commission.",

They were spotted chatting and walking closely together. The Olsen twin wore a tan knit hat, black trench coat, white t-shirt, black pants, and matching boots.

The source also mentioned that Mary-Kate is \"laying low\" following the split and reportedly rented a \"$325,000 Hamptons mansion for the summer\" to stay out of the public eye until her legal proceedings are finalized.  A source told Page Six that she planned to \u201c[decamp] to the multimillion-dollar Hamptons estate with a private dock.\u201d\n\nIn August, insiders told Entertainment Tonight that Mary-Kate was not ready to start dating after filing for divorce.

        "Thinking about personal finances can feel like a heavy burden. Some people effortlessly keep theirs in order, while others struggle. Learning how to manage finances effectively can greatly ease this burden. Discover new approaches to managing your money in this article.\n\nYou can save money by adjusting your air travel schedule on a small scale, such as shifting trips to different days or seasons. Flights in the early morning or late at night are often much cheaper than midday trips. By organizing your other travel needs around off-peak flying times, you can save a significant amount of money.\n\nCreate a separate bank account for emergency funds and refrain from using it for daily expenses. An emergency fund should only be used for unexpected expenses that are out of the ordinary. Keeping this fund separate from your regular account will provide peace of mind, knowing you have funds available when needed most.\n\nTeach your young child about finances by giving them an allowance to use for toys. This will help them understand that spending money on one toy means having less money for another. It instills the value of being selective about purchases.\n\nIt's never too late to start saving for your future. Instead of spending everything you earn, or even more, get serious and start planning for tomorrow. Begin saving, investing, and preparing today for the future you desire.\n\nConsider switching to a credit union if your bank charges high monthly fees for a checking account. Credit unions often offer better deals since they are member-owned and not profit-driven like traditional banks. Eligibility for credit union membership is usually based on residence, employment, or organizational affiliation.\n\nAvoid credit repair offers received via email, as they could be potential fronts for identity theft. Only work with credit repair agencies in person to ensure security.\n\nTo prevent bills from being overlooked and going unpaid, set up a filing system to keep track of due dates. If you pay bills online, use a service that sends reminders as due dates approach.\n\nWhen it comes to personal finance, consider buying a used car instead of new. New cars depreciate rapidly, whereas used cars can be found in good condition with low mileage, having already absorbed the initial depreciation cost.\n\nOpt for buying breakfast cereal in large plastic bags rather than boxed versions for cost savings. Compare unit prices to see the difference in cost, as bagged cereal is typically more affordable with similar ingredients.\n\nRegularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure you are maximizing returns.",

        "City Manager Edward M. Augustus Jr. earlier this year tasked the Human Rights Commission and the Police Department to collaborate on engaging community conversations regarding a body camera program, as part of wider reforms aimed at dismantling structural racism in Worcester. The commission received briefings on police body cameras and is set to host community listening sessions on the topic through the summer and fall.\n\nThe idea of a permanent body camera program in Worcester, building upon a 2019 pilot program, has garnered support from both police and community advocates. However, the city is waiting for recommendations from a statewide task force before implementing a full program. Concerns were raised about privacy protections, consequences for non-compliance with camera policies, and potential delays in accessing public records related to body camera footage.\n\nAt-large City Councilor Khrystian King emphasized the need to move forward with implementing another pilot program without waiting for the task force's recommendations. He stressed the importance of transparency and accountability that body cameras could provide, supporting both officers and citizens.\n\nLt. Sean Murtha provided details on the previous body camera pilot program, highlighting its success and the positive feedback from participating officers. He outlined the policies and procedures governing camera usage, emphasizing the potential benefits in promoting accountability and resolving complaints efficiently.\n\nThe city, according to Isabel Gonzalez-Webster of Worcester Interfaith, must ensure solid policies are in place to make body cameras a tool of trust between the police and the community. She urged the city to go beyond the state task force recommendations and set a high standard for body camera usage, emphasizing the need to balance transparency with privacy considerations.\n\nDaniel Nakamoto from the state Executive Office of Public Safety and Security discussed the state's efforts to assist local departments in developing body camera programs. He highlighted a grant program to support capital purchases for such programs and acknowledged the state's lag in adopting body cameras compared to the national average.\n\nRahsaan Hall of the ACLU stressed the importance of community engagement in shaping body camera policies, emphasizing transparency and privacy considerations. He recommended clear guidelines for camera usage, public availability of key footage, and consequences for policy violations, while also advocating for limits on surveillance technologies.\n\nAs the Human Rights Commission prepares for citywide listening sessions on body cameras, commissioners raised questions about privacy, storage, and oversight. They expressed a need for clarity on the feedback sought from the public, especially in light of pending state task force recommendations. Scheduled listening sessions in various districts will provide an opportunity for community input on the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the discussions at the Human Rights Commission meeting highlighted the complexities and considerations surrounding the implementation of a body camera program in Worcester. While there is broad support for such a program, stakeholders are grappling with issues of privacy, transparency, and community engagement to ensure that body cameras serve as tools for accountability and trust-building between law enforcement and the public.",

Bill Richardson's late Thursday announcement. The release of Gustavo C\u00e1rdenas and Jorge Toledo marks a significant development in the ongoing detention of six Citgo executives.\n\n## Background of the Detention\n\nThe executives were summoned to Caracas in November 2017 for a meeting at PDVSA, Venezuela's state-run oil company and Citgo's parent organization. During this meeting, masked security agents arrested them. Venezuelan authorities accused the men of corruption, alleging they attempted to refinance $4 billion in Citgo bonds by offering 50% of the company as collateral for personal gain.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n\"This is a positive and important first step,\" Richardson stated, expressing gratitude to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for maintaining dialogue following their personal meeting earlier this month. The release comes after Richardson's humanitarian mission to Caracas, though Maduro's government has not officially commented on the development.",
        "When you capture a photo on your Google Nexus 6P, the smaller Nexus 5X or Samsung Galaxy S7 stock camera app, the photos mysteriously disappear after a while. This may ensure that the camera app saves it locally onto your device. The issue seems to affect all users running the HDR+ mode on the stock camera app in their handset. It gets even worse since the bug has no particular pattern, rather, random images disappear with others remaining intact. If you are facing a similar problem, you can try clearing the Camera app\u2019s cache memory as well as wiping the cache partition via recovery.\n\nThere have also been reports of disappeared pictures showing up unexpectedly after a few months. Anyone is encouraged to share photos in groups and then any member can edit or tag them. In addition, Google would lend its computer vision technology and prowess that now powers popular services such as Google Photos, YouTube, and Google\u2019s own image search. Google has confirmed this app without giving any further details.\n\nAnother simple solution is to download another camera application to be used instead of the stock camera on the Nexus. In fact, some users have reported that they were still able to view old photos on their phones using a third-party camera app. Setting the correct date and time should help resolve this issue as per several user reports till now. Others have claimed that an update to your Google Nexus 6P or Nexus 5X\u2019s system date and time might just be the cure to this issue.\n\nNow press the Volume button to open the recovery mode screen and then hit the Power button to choose it. You will see an Android alone lying on its back. Now press and hold the Power and Volume Up buttons to boot into recovery. Using the volume buttons, go to Wipe cache partition and select that with the power button. The news comes from TechCrunch, which notes that the app allows groups to edit photos together and then organize them. But it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try anyway. This, however, can be done via Settings About System update Check for updates. These pictures are compressed by Google to save space on their cloud storage servers.\n\nThere is only one fix to resolve this issue, wherein you are required to open the captured photo once on the camera so that it gets stored locally on your handset. For now, it\u2019s best to keep your device up to date.",

        "The simultaneous arrival of a new Little Women film and a television series about Emily Dickinson has sparked a conversation about how we reimagine the lives of girls and women of the past.  Both projects offer fresh takes on 19th-century New England, specifically the 1860s, and the interior lives of young women constrained by societal expectations.  This shared context makes comparing the two projects particularly compelling.\n\nGreta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's *Little Women*, boasting a star-studded cast, promises a modern sensibility while remaining faithful to the source material.  The trailer showcases a dynamic portrayal of the March sisters, highlighting their ambition, talent, and struggles against societal limitations. Gerwig\u2019s use of Alcott\u2019s own letters, as evidenced by Jo\u2019s impassioned speech about women\u2019s minds and souls, demonstrates a commitment to capturing the spirit of Alcott's vision.  This approach suggests a balance between historical context and contemporary resonance, aiming to make the story feel relevant to a modern audience.\n\nIn contrast, Apple TV's *Dickinson*, starring Hailee Steinfeld, takes a more radical approach to its subject matter.  The trailer presents a rebellious, almost anachronistic Emily Dickinson, challenging the historical image of the reclusive poet.  This Dickinson embraces fame, plays air guitar, and seeks out passionate encounters.  While visually compelling, this portrayal raises questions about historical accuracy and the potential prioritization of \"Girl Power\" aesthetics over the nuances of Dickinson's complex inner life.  The series appears less concerned with faithfully representing the poet and more interested in using her name as a hook for contemporary audiences.\n\nThe different approaches of these two projects raise important questions.  In a media landscape saturated with reboots and adaptations, how much creative license is acceptable?  Is historical accuracy essential, or can these reimagined stories offer valuable new perspectives?  *The Favourite*, for instance, demonstrated that historical accuracy isn't always necessary for a compelling and successful narrative.\n\nBoth *Little Women* and *Dickinson* are derived from rich source material. Alcott\u2019s *Little Women* is semi-autobiographical, reflecting her own experiences growing up.  Dickinson's poetry, though often interpreted through the lens of her secluded life, offers glimpses into a passionate and imaginative mind.  These projects, along with previous adaptations of both stories, highlight the enduring fascination with these figures.\n\nUltimately, the success of these projects will depend on their execution.  Trailers, designed to generate excitement and anticipation, don't always reflect the final product.  Whether these adaptations will resonate with audiences and offer meaningful insights into the lives of these women remains to be seen.  However, their very existence underscores the continued relevance and richness of the female experience, past and present.  The territory of girlhood, as these projects demonstrate, continues to offer fertile ground for exploration, even if faithfulness to historical detail sometimes takes a backseat to creative interpretation.",

Depp was removed from his role as Grindelwald in the film series after losing a legal battle. Despite denying allegations of abuse by his ex-wife Amber Heard, Depp was unable to prove his case against The Sun, which referred to him as a \"wife beater.\" In a recent interview, Mads Mikkelsen shared his thoughts on stepping into Depp's iconic role in the Harry Potter universe.

Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Mikkelsen said, \"We\u2019re still working it out. There has to be a bridge between what Johnny did and what I\u2019m going to do, and at the same time, I also have to make it my own.

        "Selena Gomez and David Henrie are inviting fans to a surprise virtual premiere of their new film, *This Is the Year*.  The duo, who starred as teenage wizards on the Disney Channel show *Wizards of Waverly Place* (2007-2012), announced the premiere of Henrie's directorial debut on Monday.\n\n\"Most premieres are exclusive events for a select few, but not this one,\" Gomez says in the video announcement (see above). \"We want all of you to watch it with us.\"\n\nThe digital premiere will take place on August 28th at 4:30 p.m. PT/7:30 p.m. ET.  Hosted by TikTok stars Charli and Dixie D'Amelio, the event will include a Q&A with Henrie, Gomez, and the cast, as well as a performance by lovelytheband.\n\nWritten by Henrie, Pepe Portillo, and Bug Hall, the film follows a nerdy high school senior and his friends on a road trip to see their favorite band at the year's biggest music festival.

        "Here's the polished version:\n\nWhen asked for his final statement, Gardner, strapped to the death chamber gurney, turned toward the window where his wife's son, daughter, and mother watched just feet away, offering multiple apologies.\n\n\"I would like to say sorry for your grief,\" he said. \"I hope what I'm doing today will give you peace, joy, closure\u2014whatever it takes to forgive. I am sorry. I know you cannot forgive me, but I hope one day you will.\"\n\nAfter expressing love to several friends watching through an adjacent window, he apologized once more. Stating he didn't wish to speak at length, he asked the warden to proceed with the execution, saying, \"I want to see the Lord Jesus so bad.\"\n\nMoments after receiving the lethal dose of pentobarbital, Gardner took three deep breaths before beginning to snore. Within seconds, all movement ceased. He was pronounced dead at 6:36 p.m. CST, 16 minutes later.\n\nGardner became the first execution of the year in both Texas and the United States. Texas, the nation's leading state in capital punishment, has scheduled seven more executions in the coming months. In the previous year, while 22 inmates were executed nationwide, Texas accounted for nine of these executions\u2014the highest number among all states.\n\nHis appellate attorneys had petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, citing ineffective counsel during his trial. They particularly emphasized the failure to present evidence of \"abandonment rage\"\u2014a condition Gardner claimed causes men to use excessive force when killing female companions who have recently left or are about to leave them.\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected the petition on Monday. Seth Kretzer, one of Gardner's attorneys, expressed deep sadness at the decision. No further appeals were filed.\n\n\"For those of us who are foot soldiers in the long war for conviction integrity, the struggle continues, the hope endures and the spirit never dies,\" Kretzer said.\n\nProsecutors characterized the marriage between John and Tammy Gardner\u2014his fifth\u2014as brief but violent after their 1999 wedding.\n\n\"He was a classic abuser,\" said Curtis Howard, a former prosecutor for the Collin County District Attorney's Office.\n\nAccording to testimony from friends and family, Tammy Gardner, 41, lived in constant fear of her husband, who subjected her to physical abuse\u2014hitting, choking, and threatening her with a gun. Though she desired to leave, she confided to her boss at a wholesale horse-equipment company, \"I can't leave, he will kill me.\"\n\nIn December 2004, after borrowing money from her employer, Tammy filed for divorce.",

Ruby, a mother of a six-year-old, was abandoned by her husband due to her physical appearance and faced criticism for being overweight. Despite these challenges, Ruby refused to be demoralized and turned to fitness to transform her life.\n\nRuby shared, \"My husband's rejection based on my weight was a wake-up call for me to prioritize my health. I started walking and shed a significant amount of weight. The journey became even tougher after having my son, but I remained focused on my goal.\" She emphasized the financial strain of using expensive supplements but managed through teaching Zumba classes. Ruby has achieved national recognition in bodybuilding in Assam and also clinched the title of Ms. Chennai, expressing her desire for support from the state government to further her growth in the field.\n\nHer coach, Kartik, praised Ruby's determination and predicted her success in winning the Ms. India title.

        "The article \"LeBron Delivers Cool Tribute to Steph as 3-Point Record Nears\" was originally featured on NBC Sports Bay Area. As Steph Curry inches closer to breaking Ray Allen's record for the most 3-pointers in NBA history, his fellow players are reflecting on the remarkable legacy he has built since entering the NBA in 2009.\n\nDuring a press conference on Friday night, LeBron James took a moment to praise Curry, using his iconic \"we're all witnesses\" phrase to emphasize Steph's brilliance. LeBron commended Steph, saying, \"The fact that the other night we were really tracking to see if he would make 16 threes in a game, it just lets you know how freaking amazing this guy is. If there\u2019s one guy in NBA history that can make 16 threes, it's Steph Curry.\"\n\nLeBron went on to express his awe, stating, \"I'm literally sitting there doing the calculations in my head. I'm like '16. OK, I know he's made 12 a few times. Well, if there's someone that can do it, it'll be him.' That just lets you know how incredible he is. You can't even jinx it, cause it's gonna happen. It may not happen tomorrow ... But it's going to happen. We're all witnesses to what Steph Curry has done in his career and the way that he's changed the game. He's a once-in-a-lifetime basketball player.\"\n\nSteph and LeBron have emerged as two of the most prominent figures in the NBA, particularly following four consecutive years of meeting in the NBA Finals. As of Saturday night, Steph is only 10 3-pointers away from surpassing Allen's record of 2,973, with a game scheduled against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nOnce Curry breaks the record, we can expect an outpouring of sentiments similar to LeBron's heartfelt tribute. Even Allen himself has expressed his support for Steph, refraining from heckling him as he approaches the milestone and offering guidance throughout the process.\n\nAllen shared, \"It's an exciting time for him and I tried to give him what I was dealing with, you know, going into the game and everything that led up to it. And I was fortunate because I broke the record in Boston against the [Los Angeles] Lakers with Reggie in the building, so it's only appropriate that I find my way there. I don't know where it's going to be so I got to kind of watch this thing.\"\n\nShould Curry not break the record on Saturday, his next opportunity will come on Monday against the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis. The Warriors are reportedly contemplating resting Steph for that game, depending on the outcome of the Saturday match in Philadelphia.",

Harris County Sheriff's deputies are trained in tactical first-aid and equipped with tourniquets to address such emergencies.\n\nOne deputy's quick-thinking likely saved someone's life. Deputy Eric Moya's body cam video shows him applying a tourniquet to a gunshot victim last week in Channelview. \"Training kicks in,\" Deputy Moya explained. \"You're training to save someone's life, to render aid, and that's what kicks in at the moment.\"\n\n\"I was just blank,\" Moya recalled. \"I jumped into action trying to stop the bleeding.\" In the body cam footage, Moya can be seen moving quickly to address the situation. \"You put it around either a person's leg or arm above the wound where they're bleeding at,\" Moya said. \"You have to make sure it's tight and secure on someone and then you turn the handle.\"\n\n\"In this video, man, you're moving quick. So when you get there and see the situation, then you immediately pull that thing out?\" asked KHOU 11's Xavier Walton. According to the Harris County Sheriff's Office, the man in Moya's body cam video did survive.",
        "Petaling Jaya: Former Prime Minister Najib Razak has reportedly confirmed that Umno MPs signed statutory declarations supporting the formation of a new political coalition.  The Malaya Post quoted Najib as saying they agreed, conditionally, to Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad's coalition. However, he did not disclose the conditions.  Speculation suggests the new coalition will be called Perikatan Nasional or Pakatan Nasional.\n\nThis confirmation coincided with significant political activity involving leaders from PPBM, PAS, Umno, and a faction of PKR aligned with Deputy President Mohamed Azmin Ali. Separate meetings were held by PPBM and Umno leaders, as well as Azmin's faction.  A large presence of VIP vehicles at Istana Negara fueled speculation about the imminent formation of a new coalition.  Leaders and MPs from PKR, PPBM, Umno, and PAS also gathered for dinner at the Sheraton Hotel in Petaling Jaya, although Mahathir was absent.\n\nMeanwhile, PKR President Anwar Ibrahim's supporters gathered at his Segambut home for prayers.  Anwar confirmed an attempt to undermine Pakatan Harapan.\n\nLater that night, Anwar met with leaders from PKR, DAP, and Amanah, the component parties of Pakatan Harapan, according to his aide. This followed intense speculation about Pakatan Harapan's collapse and the formation of a new coalition by PPBM, Umno, PAS, and some PKR members. Anwar had stated earlier that there had been an attempt to betray Pakatan Harapan, hinting at potential announcements the following day.\n\nHis political secretary, Farhash Wafa Salvador Rizal Mubarak, said the meeting's location was undisclosed.  Farhash cautioned against premature speculation about a \"backdoor government,\" stating that such efforts had not yet succeeded. \"If successful, they would have announced it,\" he told reporters outside Anwar's residence.  He emphasized that forming a new government was the Yang di-Pertuan Agong's prerogative, regardless of the method. He confirmed Anwar and Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Wan Azizah Wan Ismail had a scheduled audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong the next day, characterizing it as a pre-arranged courtesy call to brief the King on political developments.",
        "**MOSCOW (AP)** \u2014 Russia's foreign minister has accused Britain and the United States of spreading \"lies and disinformation\" about the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy in England, asserting that East-West tensions are worse now than during the Cold War. \n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denounced the British accusations on Monday as a \"mad and horrible provocation,\" asserting that Russia had no motive to attack Sergei Skripal, a former double agent, and his daughter Yulia, who were poisoned on March 4 in Salisbury, England. Lavrov argued, \"If there were any gripes against the man, he wouldn't have been swapped,\" referencing Skripal's release in a 2010 spy swap from a Russian prison where he was serving time for spying for Britain.\n\nLavrov criticized Britain's claim that there was no plausible alternative explanation for the poisonings, suggesting that British intelligence agencies could have been involved. He further speculated that the case was a distraction from the British government's troubled Brexit negotiations, stating, \"It could also be advantageous to the British government, who clearly find themselves in a difficult situation having failed to fulfill their promises to voters over Brexit.\"\n\nBritish officials have previously dismissed similar allegations from Russia. Nevertheless, Russia has called a meeting of the international chemical weapons watchdog for Wednesday to discuss the case, seeking details on its cooperation with Britain in the investigation. \n\nAlexander Shulgin, the Russian representative at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), emphasized on Monday the need for an \"open, thorough and unbiased investigation\" with Russian experts' participation. He cautioned that Moscow would not accept the agency's conclusions unless Russian experts were involved.\n\nBritish authorities have invited OPCW experts to take chemical samples from Salisbury and analyze them.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the article that improves the logical flow and narrative coherence:\n\n# Athens Olympics: A Decade Later - Promise, Pride, and Missed Opportunities\n\n## The Dream Begins\nAfter failing in a bid to host the centennial Olympics in 1996, Greece, founder of the ancient and modern Olympics, was awarded the 2004 Games after defeating favorites Rome. The announcement sparked jubilant celebrations, with the Greek delegation, including then-minister George Papandreou, erupting in joy. The moment was so significant that a DJ-remixed version of the announcement was even released as a single.\n\n## From Euphoria to Reality\nHowever, the initial euphoria quickly gave way to challenges. Athens wasted the first three years of its seven-year preparation period, prompting a warning from the IOC in 2000 to accelerate its efforts or risk losing the Games. This led to a frenzied construction period, with crews working three shifts daily to complete venues just weeks before the opening ceremony.\n\nThe Games ultimately cost Greece an estimated $11 billion\u2014double the initial projections. New infrastructure emerged across Athens: trams, highways, and gleaming Olympic venues appeared alongside the city's existing architecture. Banners proudly proclaimed \"Welcome Home\" during the Games.\n\n## A Decade of Decay\nToday, ten years later, the legacy of the 2004 Olympics tells a different story:\n\n- The once-gleaming Olympic venues now largely stand abandoned\n- The former canoe and kayak venue has dried up, with spectator seats torn out\n- At the Olympic rowing center in Marathon, stray dogs roam among overgrown weeds\n- Many venues are used only occasionally for non-sporting events like conferences and weddings\n\n## The Economic Impact\nFor Greeks who once swelled with pride, the Games have become a source of frustration as the country struggles through:\n- A six-year depression\n- Record unemployment\n- Rising homelessness and poverty\n\nWhile the Hellenic Olympic Committee maintains that the Games' \u20ac8.5 billion cost didn't significantly contribute to Greece's \u20ac360 billion debt crisis, critics argue differently.",
        "Netflix stock, despite a solid earnings report last month, has slipped off investors' radar.  While the initial post-earnings reaction was a 6.5% drop, the stock has since consolidated sideways.  With the market's focus shifting to other FAANG members and high-growth tech earnings this week, is it time to circle back to Netflix?  The charts suggest a potential breakout could be imminent.\n\nTrading Netflix Stock:\n\nAfter bottoming near $467 in late July, Netflix has started to recover.  It reclaimed both the 10-day and 20-day moving averages, which are now acting as support.  However, the $510 level has presented persistent resistance this week.  A decisive rotation above $510 is key.  If it occurs, it could propel the stock towards $525, and potentially even $550.  Failure to break above $510 on Friday sets up a potential week-up rotation scenario for next week.\n\nConversely, the $495 to $500 zone is critical support.  This area converges with the 10-day and 20-day moving averages, the two-times range extension, and uptrend support.  A break below this level would signal a deeper pullback, targeting the 50-day moving average, the post-earnings low of $467.54, and the 161.8% extension near $460.\n\nDaily chart of Netflix stock.

        "Drivers in the UK can face penalties for reversing further than necessary.  The Highway Code states that \"you must not reverse your vehicle further than necessary,\" a rule reinforced by Section 106 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. This law stipulates that reversing should only be done as far as required for the safety and reasonable convenience of vehicle occupants and other traffic.  Therefore, if a police officer deems a driver has reversed excessively, they could be charged with driving without due care and attention, leading to a \u00a3100 fine and three penalty points on their licence.  This is in addition to the existing penalties for reversing on a motorway or dual carriageway, which carries a maximum fine of \u00a32,500 and three penalty points.",
        "LUBBOCK, Texas \u2014 The Texas Department of Transportation\u2019s (TxDOT) $34.4 million project is underway for completion in spring of 2021. This initiative is part of a statewide effort to enhance safety and involves adding more than 27 miles of cable median barriers to the I-27 corridor in Lubbock and Hale County.\n\nDiana Ascencio from TxDOT explained the significance of the project, which began in January 2021. \"The reason that this project is so important is that both the concrete barrier and the cable median barrier are designed to keep drivers from traveling across the median onto oncoming traffic,\" said Ascencio.\n\nMichael Oliver, senior project manager for West Texas at Webber, noted that the project is ahead of schedule. He urged patience from the public, acknowledging the inconveniences caused by construction. \u201cI would just ask people to be cautious,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI know it\u2019s disruptive, but there\u2019s no way we can build this project without being some kind of nuisance, but we\u2019re working very hard.

        "Pentagon leaders warn that more marine vessels might experience coronavirus outbreaks, following an incident on a Pacific carrier where over 400 sailors were infected. General John Hyten, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced today that a crew member from the USS Theodore Roosevelt is currently in intensive care on Guam. The ship has been docked there for over a week. Presently, 416 crew members are infected, and 1,164 test results are still pending.\n\n\"It's not wise to think that the situation with the Teddy Roosevelt is unique,\" Hyten stated at a Pentagon news conference. \"We have numerous ships at sea... assuming it won't happen again is poor planning.\"\n\nAdmiral Mike Gilday highlighted the primary issue: the difficulty in conducting rapid and widespread testing, including for those aboard the USS Nimitz, the next U.S.-based carrier slated to deploy.\n\n\"The challenge we face is developing the capability to test in both volume and speed,\" Gilday informed a small group of reporters. \"I can't provide a precise estimate on when we'll achieve the testing capacity we desire.\"\n\nSailors on the USS Nimitz, currently in port, will undergo a two-week quarantine before deployment. Although a civilian worker was transported to the Nimitz over a week ago after exhibiting symptoms, the test results were inconclusive. Hyten mentioned a small number of sick sailors, but the Navy clarified today that no current sailors on the Nimitz have tested positive for COVID-19 or displayed symptoms.\n\nRetired Admiral James Stavridis, a former NATO commander, foresees continued challenges for the Navy and other military branches. \"It's evident there are more challenges ahead,\" Stavridis expressed via email. \"The Navy and all services face difficult decisions on whether to pull units to ensure their well-being or accept a certain level of risk due to the virus. I anticipate a case-by-case approach based on mission requirements.\"\n\nGilday noted that the Navy has learned from the Roosevelt outbreak, particularly the transition from prevention to managing the virus as sailors begin to show symptoms. As of today, 3,190 crew members have tested negative, with pending results for the remainder. About 2,700 sailors have been moved off the ship and accommodated at the base and hotels on the island. Those testing positive are monitored medically twice a day.\n\nMore broadly, Hyten stated that the Roosevelt incident illustrates how the military must adapt. \"This will be a new operational reality we must address,\" he said, referencing the challenges of recruiting, training, deploying, and potentially engaging in combat during the pandemic. \"We're adjusting to this new world in real time.\"\n\nThe outbreak on the Roosevelt began in late March, plunging the Navy into a leadership crisis. Thomas Modly resigned as Navy Secretary after dismissing Captain Brett E. Crozier, the Roosevelt's commander, for widely disseminating a letter urging the Navy to take swifter action to protect his crew. Modly faced backlash for visiting the Roosevelt and delivering remarks harshly critical of Crozier.\n\nGilday announced that the investigation into the Roosevelt incident, initiated last week, is complete, and he is reviewing the report. He has not ruled out any actions, including potentially reinstating Crozier, depending on the findings. The central issue is why Crozier felt the need to send the memo and whether it indicated a breakdown in communication and leadership. \"All options are on the table,\" Gilday said regarding Crozier's future. He added that he hasn't spoken with Crozier and feels no external pressure concerning the investigation, emphasizing fairness in his actions.\n\nIn a separate appearance, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, remarked that despite the outbreak, the Roosevelt could be reactivated and return to duty if global events necessitate it. Speaking alongside Hyten, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist emphasized that military leaders recognize the coronavirus as a long-term challenge. \"We need to adapt, as the virus won't disappear in the coming months,\" Norquist stated. \"We must learn to operate effectively in a COVID environment.\"\n\nThe new coronavirus generally causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, lasting two to three weeks. However, it can lead to severe illness, including pneumonia and death, particularly in older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions.",

        "Money Talks\n\nBacklund\u2019s current contract is set to expire at the end of the 2017-18 season, a contract paying him $3.575 million annually. Given his surge in production over the last two seasons, he\u2019s likely going to be seeking a raise, and deservedly so.\n\nWith his value likely now being around the $5 million mark, the problem for the Flames becomes extending his contract. Sure, it\u2019s only $1.5 million more than he\u2019s making now, but don\u2019t forget about Matthew Tkachuk, whose contract is set to expire at the end of next season. Tkachuk is set to receive a sizeable raise as he\u2019s currently playing on an entry-level contract, and is likely to receive an extension worth at least $4 million annually.\n\nSo, where will the money come from? Obviously, the easy fix would be finding a team willing to take on Troy Brouwer\u2019s hefty contract via trade, but that remains unlikely. Matt Stajan is currently in the final year of his contract, which equals a salary cap hit of $3.125 million. Given his age, 33, and the depth the Flames have at the center position, it\u2019s highly unlikely he will be re-signed, which opens up a large chunk of salary cap space.\n\nMatt Stajan has really aged in front of us \u2026 He looks how I feel when I wake up in the morning. pic.twitter.com/vFsa9wl4Vj \u2014 Stephen Burtch (@SteveBurtch) October 5, 2017\n\nKris Versteeg and Jaromir Jagr both have contracts expiring at the end of this season, with salary cap hits of $1.75 million and $1 million respectively. There\u2019s a chance the Flames decide to keep Versteeg for another year with Tkachuk still having another year left on his entry-level contract, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any longer than that. The departures of Stajan, Versteeg, and Jagr would free up $5.875 million in cap space, enough to offer Backlund the extension and raise he deserves, while also locking up Tkachuk.\n\nRelated: Flames Need to Swap These Three\n\nThere\u2019s no question Mikael Backlund is playing the best hockey of his career right now. He\u2019s finally moulded into the centerman the Calgary Flames hoped he\u2019d become when they drafted him back in 2007. He set a career-high in points last season with 53 points (22 goals, 31 assists), surpassing his previous best 47 points from the 2015-16 season, and was even a legitimate contender for the Selke Trophy last season. There\u2019s no doubt the Flames would like to keep him around, but it\u2019s easier said than done.\n\nBacklund has developed into a reliable two-way centerman who\u2019s become a big part of the success of the Flames, making him all the more valuable to keep in Calgary.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s strong on pucks. He battles. And with his skating, he\u2019s able to get everywhere,\u201d said Flames assistant general manager Craig Conroy in a Calgary Herald article. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to run you over physically. He\u2019s not going to fight you. But he\u2019s going to battle in the face-off circle. He\u2019ll bump you. He finishes checks. He\u2019ll block shots. He\u2019ll do all those other things.\u201d\n\nRelated: Patience Pays off for Backlund\n\nThe End Result\n\nIf everything works out, the Flames will sign Backlund to a long-term, front-loaded extension that could see him play out his career in Calgary. He has become a rock for head coach Glen Gulutzan. He can be relied on in any situation on the ice, at any time of the game, and can be counted on for at least 40 points in all seasons going forward. He\u2019s the centerpiece of the \u201c3M line\u201d (Tkachuk, Backlund, Frolik), a line that is being used regularly to shut down the opposition\u2019s top line.",

        "**Big Health's Daylight App Proven Effective for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Randomized Controlled Trial**\n\n**SAN FRANCISCO & LONDON \u2013 July 29, 2020 \u2013** Big Health, the global leader in digital therapeutics for mental health, and the University of Oxford's Sleep Circadian Neuroscience Institute today announced the publication of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the journal *Depression and Anxiety*.  The study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of Big Health's Daylight app in improving symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).\n\nThe fully automated smartphone-based program leverages evidence-based cognitive and behavioral techniques to help users manage worry and anxiety.  Trial results revealed that Daylight significantly reduced anxiety symptoms compared to the control group after six weeks.  Impressively, 71% of Daylight users achieved remission of GAD by week 10, compared to just 33% in the control group.  These improvements were maintained even at the 26-week (uncontrolled) follow-up, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 a period of heightened anxiety globally.\n\n\"This trial confirms that Daylight is a safe, effective first-line digital therapeutic for worry and anxiety,\" said Professor Jasper Smits, PhD, Department of Psychiatry at the University of Texas, Austin.  \"The consistent and measurable improvements in mental health observed in Daylight users are significant and meaningful, demonstrating the potential of this software to offer relief to those suffering from worry, anxiety, and related conditions.\"\n\nAnxiety is the most prevalent mental health issue in the United States, affecting over 40 million adults annually.  GAD, characterized by excessive and difficult-to-control worry accompanied by physical symptoms and functional impairment, affects 5-6% of the population in the UK and US, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges, with numerous surveys reporting increased rates of anxiety and stress.\n\n\"Anxiety and other mental health challenges cause immense distress globally, yet access to effective solutions remains limited due to stigma and the constraints of in-person care, further compounded by the pandemic,\" explained Dr. Jenna Carl, vice president of clinical development and medical affairs at Big Health. \"These study results confirm Daylight's meaningful impact and its potential to support millions in achieving better mental health, particularly those with limited access to traditional care.\"\n\nThe trial involved 256 participants randomized to either the Daylight intervention or a control group (who received the intervention later).  Participants met criteria for GAD with moderate to severe symptoms, assessed using established clinical measures (MINI and SCID for diagnosis; GAD-7 for severity). Assessments occurred at baseline, mid-intervention (week 3), post-intervention (week 6, primary endpoint), follow-up (week 10), and long-term follow-up (week 26).\n\nIn addition to quantitative results, qualitative feedback from participants was positive, highlighting the app's engaging design, soothing voice guidance, practical tools, and overall effectiveness in managing anxiety.  Participants reported feeling more in control, better equipped to challenge negative thoughts, and more confident in their ability to handle anxiety.\n\nBeyond the primary outcomes on anxiety, the study also found statistically significant improvements in worry, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and quality of life.  The effects of Daylight were consistent across demographic groups and severity levels.\n\nDaylight was developed in collaboration with anxiety experts from Boston University, UCLA, University of Oxford, and the University of Texas at Austin.  The program combines animation, developed by veterans of Pixar and Radiolab, with a calming human voice to create an immersive and personalized experience.  Daylight is Big Health's second digital therapeutic, following the success of Sleepio, its digital sleep improvement program.  Daylight has received CE mark approval, signifying its compliance with EU medical device safety and performance requirements.\n\n*(The remainder of the text about Big Health, the University of Oxford, the Sleep Circadian Neuroscience Institute, the study authors, global smartphone usage, the disclaimer, and contact information can follow here.

        "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is visiting Long Island Friday to discuss new bipartisan legislation that would expand the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s microloan program. Gillibrand was making a stop at Farmingdale State College to say that the Mircoloan Modernization Act would make it easier for entrepreneurs to access capital to grow their business. The new legislation would be of benefit to women and minority business owners, along with other entrepreneurs, who struggle with access to capital because banks often deny them loans to start and grow a business.\n\nGillibrand said the act would raise the total limit on outstanding loans to intermediary lending organizations, allowing for more loans to be made to women, minority and other business owners. It would also expand the number of opportunities for more hands-on training assistance so that more small business owners can succeed. Women receive less than 5 percent of conventional small business loans, yet they own nearly 40 percent of businesses across the nation, according to the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. And loan denial rates for minority firms were nearly three times higher than those of non-minority-owned firms, U.S. Department of Commerce reports.\n\nThis bipartisan legislation was sponsored by Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) and has passed in the House of Representatives. The bill is also cosponsored by Senators Tim Scott (R-SC), Chris Coons (D-DE), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), and Gary Peters (D-MI).",

Declan Bogue provides the match report from Omagh.\n\nDublin's unbeaten streak in championship games continues, now at 25, though Tyrone posed a threat on Saturday night. In the 73rd minute, with Tyrone narrowing the gap to just one point after scoring three consecutive points, they had a chance to equalize with Ronan O'Neill missing a crucial free kick wide. The Dublin supporters, gathered at the Gortin Road end, breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nPaul Flynn later extended Dublin's lead, securing their spot as the first team to advance to the All-Ireland semi-finals through the Super 8's route.

This setback has not dampened the movie's success, which is seen as a pivotal moment for representation and inclusivity in the superhero genre.\n\nThe National Association of Theatre Owners has pointed to the exceptional performance of \"Shang-Chi\" as evidence that an exclusive theatrical release can yield greater profitability, contrasting with the hybrid release model tested by \"Black Widow.\" The response from moviegoers to \"Shang-Chi\" has been overwhelmingly positive, signaling a promising resurgence for the theatrical movie experience.",
        "Hyundai unveiled fingerprint access technology on the 2019 Santa Fe at the Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition, showcasing its ambitious plans for biometric car access.  This technology, initially launched in China for the Santa Fe crossover SUV, features fingerprint scanners integrated into the door handles and ignition button.  While other automakers have used fingerprint scanners for ignition, Hyundai claims to be the first to implement this technology for door handles, addressing security and durability concerns that have previously hindered wider adoption.  According to ZDNet, these concerns stem from the need for the technology to withstand various weather conditions, including extreme temperatures, sun, snow, and rain.\n\nHyundai assures a low 1 in 50,000 failure rate for the fingerprint reader, employing capacitance technology\u2014measuring electricity levels in different parts of the finger\u2014to prevent unauthorized entry.  The system allows multiple users to register their fingerprints, and the vehicle intelligently adjusts seat and mirror positions based on the recognized driver.\n\nThis 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe first drive revealed that this technology is part of Hyundai's strategy to enhance its brand perception and boost sales in the competitive Chinese auto market, where the company has faced challenges.

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# Treasury Secretary: Iran Sanctions Cut Off 95% of Oil Revenue, Further Actions Planned\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that the Trump administration's sanctions have successfully blocked 95% of Iran's oil revenue, speaking during an interview on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" with Maria Bartiromo. The administration is actively working with China and Europe to implement additional sanctions against Iran, which the U.S. designates as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nThe interview focused primarily on new sanctions imposed following Iran's missile attack on U.S. forces in Iraq. Mnuchin explained that recent measures, including a new executive order, expanded their capability to implement both primary and secondary sanctions across multiple sectors, including metals, construction, and travel.\n\nWhen questioned about potential further sanctions, Mnuchin emphasized the comprehensive nature of their current authority: \"With the new executive order, we have very strong authorities now across all industries.\" He clarified that the primary goal is to cut off funding sources for terrorist activities and nuclear weapons development, while still allowing humanitarian aid to reach Iranian citizens.\n\nAddressing concerns about China's continued relationship with Iran, Mnuchin noted that while China receives approximately 70% of Iran's current oil exports, this represents a fraction of Iran's previous oil trade. He detailed recent diplomatic efforts with Chinese officials:\n\n- Chinese state companies have ceased oil purchases\n- U.S. officials met with a Chinese delegation at the State Department\n- Sanctions have been imposed on Chinese shipping companies involved in Iranian oil trade\n- Ongoing efforts continue to eliminate remaining oil activities\n\nRegarding European allies, particularly France, Mnuchin confirmed that European nations are complying with primary sanctions to avoid secondary sanctions. He specifically addressed INSTEX (Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges), warning that it could face secondary sanctions depending on its implementation.\n\nThe Treasury Secretary concluded by reiterating the administration's commitment to humanitarian support through a Swiss channel, emphasizing that the sanctions target Iran's terrorist activities and nuclear ambitions rather than its citizens.\n\nThe article has been restructured to improve flow and readability while maintaining all key information from the original text.

Invalid Email.\n\nAfter Derby County's Championship play-off final loss to Aston Villa, a disheartened Tom Huddlestone was left pondering what could have been. Aston Villa secured a 2-1 victory at Wembley, earning promotion to the Premier League. Anwar El Ghazi put Villa ahead with a header just before half-time, and John McGinn scored a second goal shortly before the hour mark, capitalizing on a mistake by goalkeeper Kelle Roos. Derby managed to score a consolation goal late in the game when Jack Marriott's shot deflected off Martyn Waghorn.\n\nDespite their efforts, Frank Lampard's team fell short in the end. Reflecting on his emotions after the match, Huddlestone expressed deep disappointment, saying, \"I feel devastated, contemplating what might have been. The game was closely contested. Both teams had a slow start. We managed to find our rhythm in the middle of the first half, but conceding a goal just before half-time from what seemed like a harmless cross was a significant setback.\"\n\nThroughout the season, Derby had staged remarkable comebacks, and they needed another one at Wembley. \"That was the halftime message,\" Huddlestone revealed. \"We have been in more challenging situations before \u2013 like Norwich away and Leeds in the play-offs. Everyone counted us out then, but we fought back. Unfortunately, we couldn't create a clear opportunity for an equalizer. We believed we had done enough to push the game to extra time. I felt the game was evenly poised, and if we had managed to score the equalizer, we would have seized the momentum and won within the regular ninety minutes. Towards the end, they appeared fatigued.\"\n\nHuddlestone was reinstated to the starting lineup as Lampard made two changes to the team. \"As you grow older, the chances of featuring in these significant matches diminish, so it was a personal moment for me. However, I would have preferred to be on the bench and witness a victory,\" admitted the former England international.",

        "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 The owner of the Buffalo Beauts, Kim Pegula, relinquished control of the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) franchise on Wednesday, a move that could further jeopardize the future of the league as it struggles to keep its five franchises afloat without the support of the world's top players. Pegula informed NWHL Commissioner Dani Rylan of her decision during a conference call on Tuesday. The call was considered Rylan's final opportunity to change Pegula's mind, according to a person with direct knowledge of the decision who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe NWHL will re-assume control of the Beauts, but will have to renegotiate facility fees if the league intends for the team to continue playing at the Pegula-owned HarborCenter. Rylan thanked Pegula Sports for running the Beauts over the past two seasons and acknowledged their commitment to advancing hockey at all levels.\n\nThe Beauts were among the NWHL's first four teams and have advanced to the Isobel Cup championship game in each of the league's four seasons, winning it in 2017. The Pegulas earned league-wide praise for how they operated the team, providing players access to the Sabres' practice and workout facilities, and assisting in marketing efforts. Without the Pegulas, the NWHL will need to cover the Beauts' operating and salary costs, estimated to be close to $200,000.\n\nLast week, more than 200 players announced they would not play in North America this year without what they deem a single, economically viable professional league for women.

        "Key Position Battle: Strong Safety stands out as the most crucial position battle for the Texans. Tashaun Gipson, the team's starting SS and interception leader in 2019, was unexpectedly released this offseason, just a year into his three-year, $22.5 million deal. Jahleel Addae, Gipson's backup from last year, was not re-signed. The question of who will replace Gipson in 2020 remains unanswered. Eric Murray and Michael Thomas, veteran free-agent signings, are poised to compete for the starting role alongside free safety Justin Reid. Neither Murray nor Thomas have secured a consistent starting position in their careers. Jaylen Watkins was also signed this offseason for added depth, but apart from Reid, the Texans' situation at strong safety may only be considered average, which would come as a relief.\n\nMajor Strength: Quarterback. It's simple. Deshaun Watson is the linchpin in Houston's lineup, leading the team to back-to-back playoff appearances despite modest expectations for the roster. The Texans recognize Watson's significance to their success and have focused on fortifying their offensive line over the past two seasons. Watson was responsible for 34 of the team's 44 offensive touchdowns last year (26 passing, seven rushing, and one receiving) and nearly reached 4,000 passing yards for the second consecutive season. While the absence of DeAndre Hopkins this season will be felt, Watson's talent, combined with the skills of Will Fuller, Brandin Cooks, Kenny Stills, and Keke Coutee, should keep the offense dynamic. Additionally, the Texans boast depth in their tight end group, with Jordan Akins, Darren Fells, and Jordan Thomas providing solid red-zone targets for Watson. As Watson goes, so go the Texans, a trend that is expected to continue into 2020 and beyond.\n\nMain Weakness: Defensive Line. In his debut season as defensive coordinator, Anthony Weaver faces a challenge with the Texans' defensive line. The departure of D.J. Reader in free agency and the void left by Jadeveon Clowney's trade last August must be filled. The Texans ranked in the bottom eight in both passing and rushing yards allowed last season, finished in the bottom six in sacks, ranked second to Washington as the worst defense on third downs, and ended dead last in red-zone defense. While it's baffling how the Texans made the playoffs last year, it's unsurprising they squandered a 24-0 lead against the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round. The lack of pressure upfront has been a glaring issue, negatively impacting the entire defense.",

The 19-year-old was alone as she made her way to the front door of her family home in Hertfordshire, dressed in a white top, neon trousers, and clutching her Fendi handbag. Missing from her side was her 20-year-old boxer beau, Tommy.\n\nMolly-Mae and Tommy, who were the runners-up on Love Island, have not shared any photos together on their social media accounts, which collectively reach 5 million followers, since the show's finale where they lost to Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea. Despite Molly-Mae being a social media influencer, their recent posts have been managed by others. This silence has sparked concerns among some fans that their relationship might be on the rocks.\n\nNevertheless, a source close to Molly-Mae reassured fans that the couple is still together and looking forward to the future. The source explained, \"Tommy and Molly are very much together and so excited for what\u2019s to come. They absolutely have not split. They are currently dealing with a very hectic schedule and are just adjusting to a routine.\"\n\nWhile some fans continue to speculate about their relationship status, others have defended the couple, highlighting that not every aspect of their lives needs to be shared on social media.

        "Farm loan waivers have become a hot topic in Indian politics, with three newly elected Congress-led state governments announcing their intentions to waive off farm loans. Rahul Gandhi, the Congress chief, tweeted about the loan waivers in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, hinting that Rajasthan might follow suit soon. This move comes after the Congress defeated the BJP in these states.\n\nThe real impact of these loan waivers remains to be seen, as the quantum of funds required and the ability of the governments to fund such one-time expenses are in question. The fine print of the waivers, including the conditions for farmers to qualify, will determine the total amount needed in each state. Past experiences in states like Karnataka, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh show that the actual impact of loan waivers takes time to materialize.\n\nThe history of farm loan waivers in India dates back to the UPA government's massive waiver in 2008, which helped them win another term in office. Subsequent loan waivers in states like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu have added to the burden on state finances. The RBI's report highlights the strain on state budgets due to revenue deficits and growing liabilities.\n\nThe current situation in the three Congress-led states raises concerns about revenue growth and fiscal responsibility. The states may face challenges in funding the loan waivers given the slow pace of revenue growth. The decline in tax revenues, particularly related to GST implementation, adds to the uncertainty surrounding the financial implications of the waivers.\n\nWhile the exact amount for the farm loan waivers is unclear, it is evident that the states' revenue streams are not strong. Until GST collections stabilize, these governments may need to cut expenses in other areas to accommodate the loan waivers. The financial implications of these decisions will unfold in the coming months, shedding light on the feasibility and impact of the farm loan waivers in these states.",

        "The Robins announced their retained list yesterday evening, revealing that they would not be extending defender Mark Little\u2019s contract with Bristol City. Little, who played as a right back, will be leaving Ashton Gate after a challenging season but had been a key part of the lineup during a successful run of six victories at the end of the season. Little had previously been with League One Peterborough United before signing with City, and he also had stints at Wolves, Northampton Town, Peterborough, and Chesterfield.\n\nPeterborough United fans have expressed their interest in potentially bringing back Mark Little to their club now that he is available. Little had signed with Peterborough in a three-year deal on May 24, 2010, after his time at Wolves. If he does return to Peterborough, he may face his former team, Bristol City, including a match against their rivals, Bristol Rovers, where he might receive support from both sets of fans.\n\nThe speculation surrounding Mark Little's potential move to Peterborough has sparked discussions among fans. Peterborough supporters have been vocal in expressing their desire to see Little back at the club, with some stating that they would welcome his return. The possibility of Little reuniting with Peterborough has garnered excitement among the POSH faithful, who are eager to see how this transfer saga unfolds.",
        "What have the national anthem, breastfeeding, sarcasm and environmental disasters got in common? Over the last year, there have been calls for each of these topics to be taught in schools \u2013 a practice known as \u2018curriculum dumping\u2019. Every time a societal issue arises, the expectation is for schools to address it.  If only pupils learned about knife crime, acid attacks, revenge porn, or gambling, the logic goes, these problems would disappear.\n\nThis raises some common sense questions. With an already packed curriculum, do schools have the time and expertise?  A new report by the campaign group Parents and Teachers for Excellence highlights this issue. After scouring social media, newspapers, and other sources, the group unearthed 213 examples of suggested new \u2018subjects\u2019 for 2018 alone.  It points out that schools would need hundreds of additional hours to teach them all.  The top three themes proposed were health, finance, and technology.  Other suggestions included the Commonwealth, workers\u2019 rights, litter picking, the RAF, marriage, how to avoid dog bites, oceans, feminism, and even using trampolining to teach literacy skills or Love Island to critique celebrity culture.  Some of the more outlandish ideas included teaching sado-masochism and swearing.\n\nThe report also raises concerns over schools becoming \u2018catnip\u2019 for lobby groups and policy-makers, asking, \u201cWhat should schools stop doing to make time for your proposal?\u201d Parents and Teachers for Excellence concludes: \u201cWe believe that teachers and schools are the ones best placed to decide what their students need to know.\u201d\n\nYet, sometimes policy-makers do offer valuable suggestions.  Education Secretary Damian Hinds recently revealed a new initiative: a \u2018bucket list\u2019 or \u2018passport\u2019 of activities for primary pupils, encouraging learning outside the classroom.  This recognizes that learning doesn\u2019t have to be confined to school and that parents can be the natural educators.  The passport includes 20 activities for each year group.  Tasks for reception pupils include visiting a farm, painting a self-portrait, making a paper boat, re-telling a story to an audience, and posting a letter.",

The stock, which recently reached the $1,000 level for the first time, is down 2% in Thursday premarket trading following the report.\n\nGraham outlined three key reasons for the downgrade:\n\n1.

Margin pressure: \"Our refreshed detailed segment analysis suggests firmly that consensus gross margin estimates are too high, and while revenue growth mostly makes up for this, we believe this limits the potential for upward EPS revisions.\"\n\n3.

After a Redbirds timeout, both teams committed turnovers before Zach Copeland's three-point attempt fell short for Illinois State.

Of the 11 identified cases, nine appear to have spread between students, with seven remaining active.\n\nDr. Eileen de Villa noted that investigations revealed multiple opportunities for transmission during various multi-grade activities, both on and off campus. The school's location in the Markland Woods community, where vaccination rates lag behind the city average (73% versus 81.6% for residents 12 and older), has prompted additional preventive measures:\n\n- Establishment of a mobile vaccination clinic on school grounds\n- Distribution of take-home COVID-19 testing kits\n- Comprehensive contact tracing efforts\n\n## Provincial Context\n\nWhile Ontario education officials maintain that in-school transmission remains \"minimal,\" Silverthorn's situation presents a concerning counterexample.

Stokes-Robinson faced charges of child neglect and was also booked into the county jail with a bond of $5,000.\n\nThe arrest stemmed from a report received by the Florida Department of Children and Families after a school staff member noted a bruised face on a boy who attended the school. The concerned staff member reported the incident, prompting an investigation.\n\nSubsequent investigation revealed that the child had been struck in the face multiple times with a belt by Robinson. Authorities observed bruising on the child's face, noting a red mark on the left side that appeared to resemble a belt buckle. The boy was taken to the Gulf Coast Kid's House for further examination and questioning by investigators.\n\nStokes-Robinson was questioned over the phone and claimed that the boy's injuries occurred from a fall, but the investigators found the explanation dubious.

        "Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo received a two-match suspension on Wednesday for kicking Cordoba defender Edimar during Real's 2-1 La Liga victory the previous Saturday.  As Ronaldo left the pitch, he pointedly brushed the Real Madrid crest on his jersey.  This incident followed Real Madrid's historic first Club World Cup title, secured with a 2-0 victory over San Lorenzo in Morocco on December 20th.\n\nCordoba coach Miroslav Djukic characterized Ronaldo's actions, which also included an apparent slap of Edimar as the defender fell and a forearm to the face of Jose Angel Crespo, as \"an act of desperation.\"  Djukic also criticized Ronaldo's gesture towards the Real Madrid badge.\n\n\"His gesture with the badge was ugly and conceited,\" Djukic told Marca.  \"Such behavior is unbecoming of the best players in the world, which he and [Barcelona's Lionel] Messi are.\"\n\nDjukic further suggested that Cordoba's success in containing Ronaldo during the match contributed to the Portuguese international's frustration.  \"He wasn't feeling good. That's what caused the whole thing; it stemmed from his desperation,\" Djukic concluded.",

        "Rents in London have decreased during the Coronavirus pandemic, according to property portal Zoopla. However, London remains an exception, as rents have risen in a vibrant rental market across the UK as a whole.\n\n\"Average rents in London have fallen by 5.2 percent over the last 12 months, reaching levels last seen in 2014,\" Zoopla reported. This decline is attributed to \"new working patterns and the lack of tourism during the pandemic.\"\n\nIn contrast, rents outside of London increased by 1.7 percent, and rental demand has surged by a fifth over the past year. This strong demand is driven by a squeeze on lending to potential first-time buyers, Zoopla explained. \n\n\"At the same time, supply remains constrained, with investment in buy-to-let properties still reduced following changes to Stamp Duty (the additional 3 percent surcharge on second properties) and the broader tax regime introduced from 2016 onwards.\"\n\nRenters are increasingly interested in larger properties, particularly those with access to outdoor spaces. \n\n\"The search for space, first observed in the sales market, is now being strongly replicated by renters. Zoopla's top searches for rental properties include terms like gardens, parking, garages, balconies, and pets, reflecting a need for outdoor space and freedom necessary to cope with lockdown. There is also evidence that while the market as a whole is moving more quickly, the market for rented houses is moving more rapidly than that for rented flats, highlighting this desire for more space among renters.\"\n\n\"For most of the UK, the demand-supply gap is supporting moderate levels of rental growth,\" said Zoopla's head of research, Gr\u00e1inne Gilmore.\n\n\"The split in the rental market caused by COVID-19 has now become pronounced, and we are witnessing a firmly entrenched two-speed market. \n\n\"We haven't seen an exodus of students from cities, and as more people remain in the rental market due to the squeeze on mortgage lending, higher levels of demand will continue to support rents. However, muted earnings growth will begin to limit the potential for rental growth in some markets. \n\n\"The search for additional space, both indoor and outdoor, within the rental sector is set to continue as the country experiences further lockdown periods.\"",
        "Here's a polished version of the article:\n\n# Nick Cannon May Replace Wendy Williams Amid Contract Uncertainty\n\nWendy Williams' future as a talk show host remains uncertain, with Nick Cannon potentially poised to take over her coveted 10am time slot. Sources close to the situation have exclusively revealed to The Sun that executives are considering The Nick Cannon Show as a replacement if Williams doesn't return.\n\n\"The immediate plan would be to move Nick into the 10am slot, which follows the local news broadcast,\" a source explained. \"Other stations nationwide that carry both shows back-to-back would likely follow New York's lead.\"\n\nAnother insider noted that while no renewal decisions have been made for The Wendy Williams Show beyond this season, distribution executives are closely monitoring ratings. \"The show has actually performed stronger than expected in Williams' absence,\" the source added.\n\n## Williams Addresses Her Absence\n\nThe 57-year-old host recently took to Instagram to address her fans directly:\n\n\"HOW YOU DOIN'? I MISS YOU ALL! My health has been a hot topic. While I'm making progress, recovery is taking longer than anticipated. As a woman of a certain age, I'm following my doctors' guidance and will return to my purple chair when the time is right.\"\n\nShe expressed gratitude to her staff, guest hosts, and network partners while emphasizing her focus on recovery: \"Right now, Wendy has to focus on Wendy.\"\n\n## Health Challenges\n\nWilliams' health struggles became public in September when emergency services were called to her Manhattan apartment. The Sun first reported that police received a call requesting psychiatric services for the host. Sources later revealed ongoing addiction challenges, with one insider noting, \"Wendy was drinking every day, even while filming the show.\"\n\nHer health complications, including a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, Graves' disease, and psychiatric issues, led to the postponement of the show's September 20th season premiere.\n\n## Guest Hosts Step In\n\nDuring Williams' absence, several celebrities have taken turns hosting, including:\n- Leah Remini\n- Sherri Shepherd\n- Whitney Cummings\n- Jerry Springer\n- Michael Rapaport\n- Bill Bellamy\n\nNotably, Remini and Shepherd have received particularly positive audience responses, with some viewers calling for Shepherd to become the permanent host.\n\nNick Cannon, who launched his own daytime talk show in May, could be particularly well-positioned for the role. \"He could eventually be Wendy's replacement - and she knows it,\" a source suggested, noting that Cannon's show shares producers with Williams' program.\n\nThe situation continues to develop as Williams focuses on her recovery and network executives evaluate their options for the future of the time slot.",
        "A 14-year-old boy is facing multiple charges after being accused of maintaining a \"hit list\" that targeted fellow classmates and staff at his middle school. The student, whose identity remains undisclosed due to his age, was a student at West Clermont Middle School. As per the Clermont County Sheriff's Office officials, the eighth-grader had compiled a list of individuals he purportedly intended to harm.\n\nUpon discovery of the list by school authorities on Wednesday, an investigation was promptly initiated in collaboration with the sheriff's office. Deputies from the sheriff's office interviewed the boy, who admitted to creating the so-called \"hit list\" but claimed he had no actual plans to act on it.\n\nSheriff Robert Leahy of Clermont County emphasized in a statement that safeguarding the welfare of both staff and students within schools is a top priority for the sheriff's office. He urged students to report any safety concerns on campus.\n\nThe boy has been charged with two counts of aggravated menacing and one count of disorderly conduct within a school zone. He has since been taken into custody and transferred to the Clermont County Juvenile Detention Center.",
        "Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi has announced that the government will develop an online Central Reporting Mechanism dedicated for complaints relating to cybercrime against women and children. The portal, hosted by the Ministry of Home Affairs, will flag off all kinds of images related to child pornography, rape/gang-rape imagery, revenge porn, and any sexually abusive material. The decision was taken following a meeting chaired by Maneka on Tuesday.\n\nManeka Gandhi said the ministry will fund the training of analysts so that they can judge what qualifies as pornographic material. She also suggested to representatives from Twitter to have a list of violent words such as rape, bitch, whore, or similarly offensive words, and filter out such words depending on the context in which they are used, instead of imposing a blanket ban.\n\nMinistry officials mentioned that the Ministry of Home Affairs has established a sub-project under Cyber Crime Prevention against Women and Children, funded under Nirbhaya. Currently, the system responds to complaints, but the future plan is to utilize technology that can automatically identify and remove such content. The process currently involves the police reporting the matter to the cyber cell, which then informs the relevant union government departments.\n\nThe officials emphasized that the intent of having a dedicated portal hosted by the MHA is to expedite the process, aiming to resolve matters within 24 hours. The goal is to escalate content for blocking and removal, as well as to initiate early prosecution. Maneka Gandhi's efforts reflect a proactive approach to tackling cybercrime against women and children.",

Co-chairman Kevin Matthews stated that the group would reconvene Monday morning to continue discussions.\n\nLankford, who is also a commission co-chairman, angered some members by joining a Senate protest of some states' electoral votes. Although he ultimately dropped his protest, he continued to express reservations about the election process in states that were carried by Democrat Joe Biden. A few days later, Lankford apologized, explaining that he did not realize the protest would be perceived as an attempt to invalidate the ballots of Black voters in cities such as Detroit, Atlanta, and Philadelphia.\n\nIn response to these actions, several Black Tulsans called for Lankford to resign or be removed from the commission, which is coordinating activities for the May 31-June 1 centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre.",

        "If Adam Liaw were in charge of marketing vegetables in Australia, his tagline would be simple: Vegetables are delicious. The former Masterchef winner, television presenter, columnist, and prolific recipe writer was candid and direct about food trends during his address at Hort Connections 2019 in Melbourne, the largest gathering of the horticulture supply chain in Australia.\n\nInstead of a standard slide show presentation and polished video, Mr. Liaw opted to engage with the audience by having an informal chat about food. This allowed him to share his insights on Australian dietary trends, food choices, and industry promotion in a more conversational manner.\n\nRight from the beginning of his presentation, Mr. Liaw emphasized that the food movement in Australia was leaning towards increased vegetable consumption. Supported by data, he pointed out that Australians were cooking more vegetable-based meals, a shift he observed through social media trends and research outlets.\n\nDelving into the analysis of recipe searches, Mr. Liaw noted a growing interest in exploring new vegetables and innovative ways to prepare traditional ones. He highlighted the importance of social media in gauging consumer preferences, particularly the rising popularity of inventive vegetable dishes.\n\nMr. Liaw, known for creating around 700 recipes annually, credited early seasons of Masterchef for changing how Australians viewed food. He emphasized the need to write recipes that resonate with a wide audience, whether by evoking exotic locales or offering practical solutions for home cooks across the country.\n\nLooking ahead, Ausveg CEO James Whiteside emphasized the pivotal role horticulture will play in meeting future food demands globally. Mr. Liaw's analysis of popular recipes from Good Food revealed a significant portion of vegetarian dishes among the top choices, indicating a growing interest in plant-based options.\n\nDespite the surge in vegetable-centric recipes, Mr. Liaw cautioned against assuming that Australians were consuming healthier diets overall. He noted that meat-centric language and cultural heritage still influenced food choices, underscoring the need to promote vegetables without framing the conversation as an exclusion of meat.\n\nIn addressing challenges related to shifting consumer behaviors towards healthier eating habits, Mr. Liaw stressed the importance of appealing to taste and texture preferences rather than resorting to deceptive practices like hiding vegetables in dishes.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# U.S. and Taiwan Strengthen Economic Ties Through New Dialogue Initiative\n\nThe United States and Taiwan are deepening their economic partnership through a newly established dialogue framework, marking another significant development in the Trump administration's enhanced engagement with the self-governed island.\n\nThe cornerstone of this cooperation is a five-year agreement establishing the U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue, designed for annual meetings. While not reaching the scope of a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement, this initiative represents a substantial advancement in Washington-Taipei relations.\n\nBeijing, which maintains its claim over Taiwan and reserves the right to reunify by force if deemed necessary, has expressed strong opposition to these developments.\n\nBrent Christensen, director of the American Institute in Taipei (the de-facto U.S. embassy), emphasized the significance of the dialogue: \"This economic partnership not only reflects the robust U.S.-Taiwan economic relationship but also signals its continued growth and evolution.\"\n\nRecent developments have paved the way for stronger economic ties:\n\n- Taiwan's August 2020 decision to ease restrictions on American beef and pork imports removed a significant trade barrier\n- U.S.-Taiwan trade reached approximately $103.9 billion in 2019\n- The dialogue encompasses crucial areas including:\n  - The State Department's Clean Network project\n  - 5G security\n  - Semiconductor cooperation\n  - Investment screening\n  - Scientific and technological collaboration\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu characterized the dialogue as an \"important milestone,\" noting it represents \"the highest level regular economic dialogue between the U.S. and Taiwan.\" He emphasized the importance of identifying specific areas for concrete cooperation and progress.\n\nThe talks, conducted partially in person in Washington, were led by U.S. Undersecretary of State Keith Krach and Taiwanese Minister John Deng, with additional participants joining virtually from both sides.\n\nThis dialogue follows significant diplomatic exchanges earlier in the year:\n- Keith Krach's visit to Taiwan\n- Health Secretary Alex Azar's historic visit\u2014the highest-level U.S. Cabinet official to conduct talks in Taipei since 1979\n- China's response included military demonstrations, with fighter jets crossing the Taiwan Strait during both visits\n\nThe strengthening relationship has also extended to defense cooperation, exemplified by the Trump administration's increased arms sales to Taiwan, including a $2.37 billion Harpoon missile systems deal announced in October.",
        "A Bedminster man who admitted to engaging in inappropriate online behavior with a child is awaiting sentencing. Michael Rendell, 36, of Wedmore Vale, appeared at Bristol Crown Court on June 8, 2018, where he pleaded guilty to several charges, including causing or inciting a child under the age of 16 to engage in sexual activity between December 2015 and December 2016.\n\nRendell had previously admitted to additional charges, including taking indecent photos of a child between June 2016 and March 2017, as well as making indecent images of children between October 2016 and March 2017. These images consisted of 31 in Category A (the most serious level of abuse), 93 in Category B, and 2,067 in Category C.\n\nJudge Martin Picton, who presided over the case, adjourned sentencing to allow for further assessments. He ordered a probation report and psychiatric evaluation to better understand Rendell's background before deciding on the final punishment. \"These are serious offences, but the court needs to know a lot more about you before final disposal,\" Judge Picton stated.\n\nIn the meantime, Rendell was released on bail under the condition that he fully cooperates with the probation service.",
        "**Henri: A Northeast Tropical Storm**\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Henri, downgraded to a tropical storm on Sunday, churned inland across the Northeast. Here\u2019s a breakdown of this unusual weather event:\n\n**Henri's Status and Impact**\n\nHenri, downgraded from hurricane status early Sunday, made landfall in Rhode Island at midday. By Sunday evening, it weakened further while moving over western Massachusetts and Connecticut.  While wind speeds decreased to 40 mph (64 kph), the primary threat remains heavy rainfall, leading to potential storm surges and inland flooding, historically more dangerous than high winds.\n\nHenri veered west after landfall, impacting Connecticut and New York's Hudson River Valley with heavy rain and potential flooding. While the storm surge wasn't as significant as Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the storm's slow movement concentrates rainfall, increasing flood risks.  The storm is forecast to move east early Monday, affecting Vermont and New Hampshire before exiting into the Gulf of Maine.\n\n**Hurricanes vs. Tropical Storms**\n\nThe distinction lies in sustained wind speeds. Hurricanes have sustained winds of 74 mph or higher, while tropical storms have sustained winds up to 73 mph.\n\n**Historical Context: Henri, Bob, and Gloria**\n\nHenri\u2019s near-hurricane landfall would have been New England's first in 30 years.  Hurricane Bob in August 1991 caused 17 deaths and $1.5 billion in damage.  Connecticut residents may recall Hurricane Gloria in September 1985, which hit Long Island and Connecticut, resulting in eight deaths and nearly $1 billion in damage.\n\n**Storm Naming Conventions**\n\nThe World Meteorological Association assigns human names to Atlantic storms, cycling through a list of 21 names each season.\n\n**Formation and Climate Change**\n\nTwo factors contribute to northward-tracking storms: a tropical system and steering currents. While rare, Henri's path isn't directly attributed to climate change, although global warming is known to intensify hurricanes, making them stronger and wetter.\n\n**Preparedness and Comparisons**\n\nResidents are advised to take standard precautions: secure boats, fuel vehicles, stock supplies, and prepare for potential power outages, which could last a week or more. While Henri is unlikely to replicate Superstorm Sandy\u2019s impact on New York City and the Jersey Shore, the Hudson River Valley faces significant flood risk.  Unlike Sandy, Henri provided less preparation time.\n\n**Comparisons to Other Storms**\n\nHenri is unrelated to 1991's \"Perfect Storm\" (also known as the Halloween Storm), a nor'easter that later developed a hurricane at its center.  This unnamed hurricane would have been called \"Henri\" due to the six-year recycling of Atlantic hurricane names (excluding retired names like Katrina and Bob).  The 2000 film \"The Perfect Storm\" depicts this event, not Hurricane Bob. While Hurricane Irene in 2011 impacted Vermont, it had weakened to a tropical storm by then.\n\n**Current Situation and Governor's Status**\n\nDespite some schools returning, tourists remain on the Atlantic coast.  Outgoing Governor Cuomo, whose term ends Monday at 11:59 p.m. EDT, is currently managing the state's response to Henri.",

        "To improve the logical flow and coherence of the text, I have restructured and rearranged the paragraphs and sections. Here is the revised version:\n\nETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, is a leading institution known for its focus on science and technology. Established in 1855, it has become a center of innovation, channeling research into high-tech sectors like computer science, micro and nanotechnology, and medicine. The university boasts an impressive track record, with 21 Nobel laureates having studied, taught, or researched there. ETH Zurich has established its presence beyond Switzerland through initiatives like the Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC).\n\nIn 2010, Dr. Remo Burkhard moved to Singapore to build the Singapore-ETH Centre, the first research center established by ETH Zurich outside Switzerland. The center was established in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) program. It aims to tackle pressing urban challenges in collaboration with Singaporean universities, government agencies, and industry.\n\nSince its founding, the Singapore-ETH Centre has become a vibrant research hub with approximately 200 researchers working under two main programs: Future Cities Laboratory (FCL) and Future Resilient Systems (FRS). FCL, established in 2010, focuses on making cities more sustainable and livable, while FRS, launched in 2014, aims to enhance the resilience of infrastructure systems.\n\nA pioneering project under the Future Cities Laboratory is the Cooling Singapore initiative. Led by SEC director Gerhard Schmitt, the project seeks to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect in Singapore and improve outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) and liveability. The initiative aligns with Singapore's commitment to reduce emission intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n\"As urban centers like Singapore become more densely populated, more heat is generated, impacting the environment. The Cooling Singapore project aims to address these challenges,\" says Dr. Burkhard. The project received a grant from Singapore's National Research Foundation in 2017, bringing together expertise from the National University of Singapore (NUS), SMART (Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology), and TUMCREATE.\n\nThe Cooling Singapore project has a multifaceted approach. It seeks to establish an inter-agency task force comprising members from various Singaporean agencies and institutions to exchange knowledge through workshops. This collaboration is crucial as tackling UHI involves economic development, urban planning, and transportation, requiring the collective effort of scientists, agencies, industry, and policymakers.\n\nOne of the project's key tasks is applying microscale climate models to study areas like Jurong Lake District, the Central Business District, and Punggol. These case studies help researchers understand how OTC varies and how different urban designs can mitigate UHI. Initial results suggest a need for more scientific research, pointing towards improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness in strategy implementation.\n\nBeyond policy and planning, businesses and individuals also play a role in mitigating urban heating. \"Heat is trapped and released from roads and buildings; energy consumption in industry and transportation are significant contributors to UHI,\" explains Dr. Burkhard. The Cooling Singapore team has developed a catalog of 86 measures to remove heat from the system, offering guidance on building materials, orientation, and clustering for better wind flow.\n\nMeanwhile, the Future Resilient Systems program and the ETH Risk Centre organized the inaugural Infrastructure Resilience Conference in Zurich, fostering knowledge exchange to enhance infrastructure resilience. The upcoming World Congress on Resilience, Reliability and Asset Management will continue these efforts in Singapore.\n\nThe Singapore-ETH Centre is also collaborating on the Digital Underground project with the Singapore Land Authority, aiming to develop 3D digital mapping methods for underground utility networks. This is crucial as Singapore explores the use of underground spaces due to limited land mass.\n\nIn addition to these projects, the 3for2 Beyond Efficiency project has adapted energy-efficient technologies developed at ETH Zurich for tropical climates.

        "**Belarus Faces New Sanctions Over Jetliner Incident and Journalist Arrest**\n\nWestern nations are preparing to impose new sanctions on Belarus and sever its aviation links after it dispatched a warplane to intercept a Ryanair aircraft, resulting in the arrest of a dissident journalist. This action has been condemned by officials as \"state piracy.\" The arrested journalist, 26-year-old Roman Protasevich, appeared in an online video, claiming he was in good health while in pretrial detention in Minsk, and admitted to organizing mass disturbances in the capital last year. However, his allies, including his father, dismissed these statements as being made under duress.\n\nPolish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski reported that Protasevich's mother had expressed concerns about his health, though details remain scant. Meanwhile, Belarus\u2019 Interior Ministry stated that Protasevich was in jail without health complaints. U.S. President Joe Biden condemned Belarus's actions and requested options to hold those responsible accountable.\n\nU.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, in a call with exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, reiterated the United States' support for democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms for the Belarusian people. The White House conveyed these sentiments.\n\nEuropean Union leaders, meeting in Brussels, called for a ban on Belarusian airlines from the 27-nation bloc's airspace and urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarus airspace. They also agreed to expand the list of sanctioned Belarusian individuals and requested an urgent investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) into the Ryanair plane\u2019s forced landing in Minsk during its Greece-Lithuania flight.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo emphasized the need for a \"swift and severe\" reaction. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney described the incident as \"aviation piracy, state-sponsored.\" EU and other Western countries have also demanded Protasevich's release, whose social media platform, maintained in exile, remains one of the few independent news outlets about Belarus following last year\u2019s crackdown on dissent. Accompanying Protasevich, 23-year-old student Sofia Sapega was also detained.\n\nSome nations and airlines preemptively reacted to the Ryanair flight diversion. Britain instructed its airlines to avoid Belarus and suspended the air permit for Belarus's national carrier, Belavia, effective immediately. KLM, part of Air France KLM, temporarily halted flights over Belarus, as reported by Dutch news agency ANP.\n\nDespite these actions, options for Western retaliation seem limited. The ICAO lacks regulatory power, and the EU cannot control flights over Belarus, except those departing from or arriving in Europe. Skipping Belarusian airspace would increase travel time and costs.\n\nPrevious rounds of U.S. and EU financial sanctions on Minsk have had little effect on President Alexander Lukashenko's behavior, who survived mass protests following a disputed election. Lukashenko has consistently denied election fraud. Since then, authorities have detained thousands of his opponents, with prominent figures either imprisoned or exiled.\n\nProtasevich\u2019s former employer, NEXTA, interviewed his mother, who suspected a bomb threat on the flight as a ruse to capture her son. \"I just want to say that my son is simply a hero,\" she declared tearfully, urging international awareness. His father, Dzmitry Protasevich, described the situation as \"total insanity.\"\n\nBelarus claims it acted due to a false bomb threat attributed to Hamas, a claim the group denies. State media reported the intervention as a direct order from Lukashenko. Ryanair\u2019s CEO Michael O\u2019Leary described the event as a state-sponsored hijacking, suggesting security agents were on board. Lithuanian officials noted that five passengers, including Protasevich and Sapega, did not continue the flight, suggesting three others disembarked in Minsk.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia, a supporter of Lukashenko, accused the West of hypocrisy. \n\n---\n\n**Note to readers:** Please ensure your email address is correct to receive updates.

The report cites confidential intelligence sources.\n\nThe Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) is reportedly investigating whether this security vulnerability could have facilitated surveillance activities by the Chinese government.\n\nWhen contacted, a Huawei representative firmly rejected these allegations, stating: \"We comply with laws and rules in every country where we operate.\" The spokesperson further emphasized that Huawei \"keeps the door closed to governments or others who want to use our network for activities that would threaten cybersecurity.\"",
        "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced at the Labour congress an extension of the government's small business loan scheme until the end of the year, providing continued support during uncertain economic times.  Originally set to expire on July 24, the scheme offers interest-free loans for up to one year (3% interest thereafter) with no repayments required for the first two years.  This extension ensures businesses facing potential future cash flow difficulties will retain access to crucial funding.\n\n\u201cThis means those businesses who are doing okay now, but who may experience cash flow difficulties further down the track, will still have access to it,\u201d Ardern told the assembled party members at Te Papa.  Later, speaking to media, she emphasized the advantage of these loans over cash grants (as previously recommended by Treasury and the National Party), highlighting the flexibility they offer. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ve drawn it down not necessarily needing it straight away, but being concerned they wouldn\u2019t be able to access it down the track. What this does is say that if you don\u2019t need it, you don\u2019t have to apply but it will be there for several more months.\"\n\nEligibility criteria remain unchanged: businesses with 50 or fewer employees who qualified for the original wage subsidy can apply for loans of $10,000 plus $1,800 per equivalent full-time employee, up to a maximum of $100,000.  The existing $5.2 billion allocated to the scheme remains sufficient, as Small Business Minister Stuart Nash previously stated that uptake was not expected to reach this maximum figure, which was based on every eligible business applying.\n\nSince May 12th, over 90,000 small businesses have applied for loans totaling more than $1.51 billion. The majority of applicants operate in construction, accommodation, restaurants and cafes, retail trade, transport, and manufacturing. Data shows that around 80% of applicants have one to five employees, and over 90% have ten or fewer. \"The average value of each loan is modest, around $16,700. But it is much-needed working capital to help in a tight spot,\" Nash said.",
        "(CNN) \u2014 Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago estate on Friday, a day after the strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, President Donald Trump said he authorized the precision strike against the commander of Iran's security and intelligence services because he was plotting \"imminent and sinister attacks\" on Americans.  \"We caught him in the act and terminated him,\" Trump said, adding that Soleimani should have been taken out by his predecessors.\n\nTrump cast his decision as one of deterrence, not aggression. \"We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war,\" he said.

        "The Matildas had entered their Olympics opener winless in five games and after a scratchy start, burst to life and dominated the clash. New Zealand goalkeeper Erin Nayler made a quick-reaction save to stop defender Abby Erceg putting Ellie Carpenter's cross into her own net in the 17th minute. Three minutes later, the Matildas capitalized on their dominance and snatched the lead through some delightful one-touch football. Yallop pounced on a turnover, worked the ball to Kyah Simon and burst forward. Simon cleverly headed the ball on to Kerr who flicked it to Yallop, with the midfielder taking a touch then smashing the ball into the roof of the net.\n\nThen, in the 33rd minute, Steph Catley whipped a powerful corner into the near post where Kerr smacked a thumping header home off the crossbar for a commanding 2-0 lead, ending her five-game scoring drought. Simon spurned a golden opportunity to add a third when she hit a chance straight at Nayler in the 47th minute and Kerr put a backheel just wide three minutes later. It proved to be the tale of the second half as the Matildas had plenty of chances but were unable to extend their lead, largely due to Nayler making several sharp saves and a drop off in intensity. Exciting teenagers Mary Fowler and Kyra Cooney-Cross made their Olympics debuts in the 75th minute but neither were able to find a goal.\n\nSam Kerr provided the assist for Tameka Yallop's opener and scored in an excellent captain's performance at Tokyo Stadium to secure Australia's first win under Tony Gustavsson. The Matildas have got their Tokyo Olympics campaign off to a near-perfect start, holding off a fast-finishing New Zealand to kick off the tournament with a 2-1 win. In the first minute of injury time, the Football Ferns snatched a consolation goal on the counter. Ria Percival headed a cross back across goal for substitute Gabi Rennie, who nodded the ball home just two minutes into her international debut, forcing the Matildas to scramble to lock up all three points.\n\nThe Matildas next face Sweden on Saturday, who are coming off a scintillating 3-0 win over the United States.",
        "Here's the restructured text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# The Rich History and Art of Irish Coffee\n\nIrish Coffee, a timeless caffeinated cocktail, is elegantly simple with just three core ingredients, keeping whiskey as its centerpiece. As National Irish Coffee Day approaches on January 25, this beloved drink, enjoyed worldwide from brunch to dessert, deserves special recognition.\n\n## Origins and Evolution\n\nThe story begins in the early 1940s at the Foynes Airbase Flying Boat Terminal Building in Limerick, Ireland. Chef Joseph Sheridan created the drink for stranded passengers, combining good Irish whiskey with hot coffee. When a passenger asked if he had used Brazilian coffee, Sheridan famously quipped, \"No, that was Irish Coffee!\"\n\nThe drink's journey to America came through Stanton Delaplane, a San Francisco Chronicle travel writer, who discovered it at Shannon Airport. Collaborating with the Buena Vista Cafe's owners Jack Koeppler and George Freeberg, Delaplane helped introduce Irish Coffee to the United States on November 10, 1952. The team even enlisted help from San Francisco's mayor, George Christopher, who suggested using cream aged at least forty-eight hours for better flotation. Through Delaplane's widely-read travel column, the drink gained popularity across America.\n\n## Modern Mastery\n\nWhile the Buena Vista Cafe has served millions of Irish Coffees since its introduction, the drink has evolved globally. However, few establishments have mastered it like The Dead Rabbit in New York City. Jack McGarry, co-owner of the legendary Irish cocktail bar, emphasizes the importance of perfect balance: \"Most places around the world, it's got too much coffee or whiskey, terrible cream, too sweet or too dry or too hot.\"\n\nMcGarry's approach treats Irish Coffee like any refined cocktail, where all ingredients are present but none dominate. He serves it at precisely 75 degrees Celsius and uses Sumatra coffee from Indonesia for its rich body and earthy, chocolatey notes.\n\n## The Dead Rabbit's Irish Coffee Recipe\n\n```\nIngredients:\n- 0.5 oz Demerara Syrup\n- 1 oz Bushmills Original Irish Whiskey\n- 3.5 oz unsweetened coffee\n- Freshly whipped cream for topping\n\nDirections: [Original text ends before providing directions]\n```\n\nWhile many modern variations exist, often incorporating unnecessary frilly toppings and sugary syrups, The Dead Rabbit's version is widely respected as one of the finest interpretations of this classic drink.",

With Miami just one strike away from victory in the ninth inning, Jud Fabian changed the game's trajectory with a line drive to left field, driving in the tying run.\n\nThe Gators capitalized on Miami's missed opportunity, exploding for five runs in the 10th inning as home fans began streaming out of Mark Light Field. Though the Hurricanes mounted a late comeback with two runs in their final at-bat, it wasn't enough to prevent the 7-4 defeat.\n\n\"Disappointing,\" Miami head coach Gino DiMare reflected. \"We had the game right where we wanted it but couldn't close it out. Finishing games was an issue last year, and we've got to do a better job.\"\n\nJunior third baseman Raymond Gil echoed his coach's sentiments: \"We just got to finish. It's something we've been talking about all year. We have to do a better job finishing.\"\n\nThe decisive 10th inning began with freshman Alex McFarlane on the mound for Miami. Kirby McMullen immediately put the Gators ahead with a home run to left field, and Florida's offense continued to surge. The visitors posted five runs in the frame, highlighted by four hits, including one from pitcher Ben Specht.\n\nMiami (4-2) has one final opportunity to salvage the series in Sunday's 1 p.m. finale. Regardless of that outcome, Florida will return to Gainesville having secured their sixth consecutive series victory over the Hurricanes.\n\nChris McMahon (1-0, 2.25 ERA) delivered a strong performance for Miami, working through six innings with nine strikeouts while allowing just one run on six hits and two walks. Despite his effectiveness, several mid-game jams elevated his pitch count, forcing an earlier exit than his Friday night counterpart, Brian Van Belle.\n\n\"Our starting pitching has been excellent,\" DiMare noted. \"McMahon had to work hard, getting extra outs.

        "**GREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014** Dale Cihlar, typically a buoyant and optimistic farmer, found himself in despair. Several of his prized dairy cows had died, milk prices were plummeting, and he faced a $1,600 monthly payment for a new manure storage system.\n\n\"I've never been in debt like this,\" said Dale, a fourth-generation dairy farmer who took over the family farm in 1990. He and his wife, Karen, sat at their kitchen table, surrounded by a mound of paperwork\u2014some detailing milk prices, others highlighting their income struggles.\n\nAfter unsuccessful appeals to various banks, Dale considered selling part of the farm to make ends meet. However, Karen had a different plan, one she hadn't shared with her husband.\n\n\"He's too proud, but I thought if people knew, maybe they would help,\" she told USA Today Network-Wisconsin.\n\nKaren took to GoFundMe, a crowdfunding platform, to write a heartfelt plea to save the family farm. Her adult children and their friends shared the campaign on Facebook, and donations began to trickle in. As word spread on social media, Karen received calls from local farmers offering help, including one who had extra hay.\n\nThe community, including friends, family, and strangers, rallied to prevent the demise of another family farm. Donations poured in from people in other states as well.\n\nSince 1873, the Cihlar family has farmed the 110-acre property, sustaining the family for generations. To handle the historical fluctuations in milk prices, Dale had embraced the budgeting practices of his forebears, saving diligently to cover large expenses and ride out price swings.\n\nFrugality was so ingrained in Dale's psyche that he didn't marry Karen until he made his last payment on the family farm. Although milk prices had been low before, they had never been this low for three consecutive years.\n\nSavings among dairy farmers were depleting across the state. Wisconsin lost 500 dairy farms in 2017, and more than 150 had quit milking cows so far this year. The number of milk herds dropped by 20% from five years ago, according to the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.\n\nThe Cihlar farm weathered these highs and lows until a perfect storm of issues hit. The historically low milk checks worsened after several prized cows died, and the $1,600 monthly manure storage system payment drained the farm\u2019s savings.\n\nDale and Karen managed to squeak by on Karen\u2019s salary from the Door County Medical Center, but their savings were exhausted. For over 100 years, the 110-acre farm and 40 cows had supported the Cihlar family.\n\n\"I couldn't be the last one. I've always thought this farm would last and be part of my family far into the future,\" Dale said.\n\nIn less than a month, the GoFundMe page Karen created raised enough money to buy one cow. After a month, they'd raised nearly $8,000 of the $35,000 goal.\n\n\"I started to cry. I couldn't believe that people were actually helping us,\" Karen said.\n\nWhen Karen showed Dale the GoFundMe site and the donations, he was dumbfounded.\n\n\"There are so many causes needing help, and I thought no one would ever want to help a farmer,\" Dale said, shaking his head. \"I was wrong; this is beyond words.\"\n\nThe cost of a dairy cow ranges from $1,000 to $1,600, with significant additional expenses for feed and veterinary care.\n\nWhile the financial support was crucial, the campaign had a broader impact by highlighting the plight of dairy farmers and showing that people can help. Offers of free feed poured in, and farmers leaving the business sold some stock to the Cihlars at reduced rates to ensure the farm's success.\n\nDale's extended family also pitched in to keep the farm within the family.\n\n\"I'm the only cousin still in farming, and this farm means a lot to them too,\" he said.\n\nBesides the donations, Dale took a part-time truck-driving job to help make ends meet. Despite knowing firsthand the challenges of dairy farming, both Dale's stepson and son-in-law are determined to keep the farm in the family. They plan to take over when Dale retires, assisting with farm chores while maintaining their day jobs.\n\n\"They help out every morning and night and know it's not easy,\" Dale said.\n\nEthan Lautenbach, Karen's son from her first marriage, shares Dale's passion for farming.\n\n\"It's a challenge every day,\" Ethan said, adding that he enjoys the lifestyle.\n\nSon-in-law Steven Baxter grew up on a small goat farm in Texas and is president of the Door County Farm Bureau. Like Dale, Steven is captivated by the animals and sees them as integral to the business.\n\n\"If it wasn't for their milk, we wouldn't have a dairy,\" Steven said. \"When a calf is born, it's a miracle, and we do everything to ensure it grows up healthy because, in the long run, that cow is what takes care of us.\"",

The distinctive two-tone rear panel now features either a glossy or matte glass finish, available in three colors: Just Black, Not Pink (a subtle rose hue), and Clearly White.\n\nThe front showcases an expanded 6.3-inch display, up from the Pixel 2 XL's 6-inch screen, while maintaining identical physical dimensions. This feat was achieved by extending the display to the chassis edges and incorporating a notch for the front cameras and earpiece. As with its predecessor, the 3.5mm headphone jack remains absent, requiring users to embrace either wireless audio or dongles.\n\nThe 1440x2960 OLED display shows marked improvement over its predecessor, exhibiting none of the color shifting or muted tones that plagued the Pixel 2 XL's pOLED screen. Initial impressions of image quality, website rendering, and general content consumption are positive, though extended testing will be necessary for a definitive assessment.\n\nHowever, the notch design proves problematic. While notches have become commonplace in modern smartphones, the Pixel 3 XL's implementation is particularly conspicuous. Unlike the subtle notch of the OnePlus 6, this deeper, more prominent cutout draws unnecessary attention to itself, despite housing dual front-facing cameras.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Pixel 3 XL ships with Android 9 Pie and Google's Pixel Launcher interface. Performance is exemplary, thanks to the combination of the Snapdragon 845 processor, 4GB of RAM, and Google's optimization efforts. While Qualcomm will likely introduce a new flagship processor in early 2019, the current chipset should remain capable for years to come.\n\nStorage options include a generous 128GB capacity, complemented by Google's cloud storage offerings.\n\n## Camera\n\nGoogle continues to buck the dual-camera trend, opting instead for a single rear lens enhanced by sophisticated AI processing. The system captures multiple images simultaneously, combining the best elements to produce optimal results. Based on initial testing, the camera appears to maintain the Pixel line's reputation for photographic excellence.\n\nThe dual front-facing cameras enable wider-angle selfies and support various creative features, including automatic capture triggered by facial expressions and adjustable Portrait mode depth effects.\n\n## Initial Verdict\n\nWhile the Pixel 3 XL offers few surprises\u2014thanks to numerous pre-release leaks\u2014it appears to be a capable flagship device that showcases Android at its finest. However, with a premium price point of \u00a3869, potential buyers should consider alternatives like the OnePlus 6 and Samsung's Galaxy S9 and Note 9 before making a decision.\n\nA full review will follow to provide comprehensive analysis, particularly regarding the controversial notch design and overall value proposition in today's competitive Android landscape.",

        "Arthur Moats, the former Pittsburgh Steeler known for his on-field ferocity\u2014including the tackle that ended Brett Favre\u2019s legendary 297 consecutive game streak\u2014is not easily intimidated. Yet, the 6-foot, 240-pound linebacker admits to feeling fear when offered a one-year, veteran\u2019s minimum \u201cprove it\u201d deal with the Steelers in 2014.  He wrestled with the uncertainty: Was his career over? Should he uproot his life and move from Buffalo to Pittsburgh?\n\n\u201cA lot of people have paralysis through analysis,\u201d Moats explains. \u201cThey overthink and allow fear to become a blocking force.\u201d His advice?  \u201cUse that fear as motivation. Take the chance and see what you\u2019re able to accomplish.\u201d  Moats confronted his fear, thrived in Pittsburgh, and earned a three-year contract after that initial season.\n\nSince retiring in 2019, he\u2019s dedicated himself to a lifelong passion: improving lives.  His book, *Theory of Life* (Leadership League), outlines a five-point plan for better living based on the acronym M.O.A.T.S.: Make happiness a priority; Openness yields strength; Actively inspire others; Turn fear into focus; Smile, spread my inner love everywhere.\n\nThis philosophy stems from his upbringing in the Tidewater region of Virginia.  Raised by ministers, he developed a strong sense of duty to others. Recognizing that his stable childhood was an ideal not everyone experiences, Moats emphasizes the importance of adult mentorship for children in challenging circumstances. \u201cWhether it\u2019s an uncle or other family member,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s important to have someone they can look to for advice and direction.\u201d\n\nWhile each element of M.O.A.T.S. is crucial, Moats is particularly passionate about actively inspiring others.  \u201cMany people mistakenly believe they need wealth, success, or a platform to be inspirational,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut inspiration is simply instilling belief in someone.  Acknowledging their efforts, offering encouragement, or empathizing with their struggles \u2013 it costs nothing.\u201d  He believes that once people understand this simplicity, they\u2019ll be more willing to inspire those around them.\n\nThroughout *Theory of Life*, Moats quotes inspirational figures like Hellen Keller, Rosa Parks, Booker T. Washington, Paulo Coelho, Dr. Joyce Brothers, and Lao Tzu\u2014a diverse group notably lacking in athletes. This unconventional approach is characteristic of Moats, who has always charted his own course.",
        "Title: 'Chaos Everywhere': Citizens Recall the Day of Babri Masjid Demolition\n\nWhere were you when the Babri Masjid was demolished? This question takes us back to the pivotal day of 6 December 1992. \n\n(Note: A special CBI court is set to pronounce its judgment in the long-standing Babri Masjid demolition case on 30 September. Among the 32 accused are former deputy prime minister LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh, and Uma Bharti. In light of this upcoming verdict, we are republishing this article and video from The Quint's archives, originally published on 9 November 2019.)\n\nVideo Editor: Deepthi Ramdas  \nVideo Producer: Aastha Gulati  \n\n\"I still remember that fateful day. I prayed that nothing like this should ever happen in India again,\" recalls Harkishan Sahu, a former government employee from Bhopal.\n\nThe Supreme Court announced its verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute on 9 November, ordering the disputed land to be handed over to a trust led by the Centre and granting five acres of alternate land to the Muslim community. The Quint reached out to citizens across India to ask where they were on 6 December 1992, the day of the Babri Masjid demolition. People from Bhopal, Patna, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad recounted the breaking news, the curfews imposed in their cities, and the nationwide commotion. Senior journalist SA Shad remembers:\n\n\"The situation became serious after 12-12:30 pm. There were attempts to contact Narasimha Rao, the then prime minister, but no contact could be made. Around 2-2:30 pm, we received the news that the Babri Masjid had been demolished.\"\n\n**'Where Were You When?'**\n\nSatish Jayantilal Modi, a van driver from Ahmedabad, recalls being in Mirzapur for car repairs when the news broke.\n\n\"We got stuck there because of the situation.",

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# Stolen SANDF Weapons Trafficked to War Zones, Investigation Reveals\n\nMilitary-grade weapons from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), including devastating machine guns capable of dismembering targets, have been stolen and reportedly smuggled across South African borders for use in conflict zones.\n\nThe trafficking operation has potentially been facilitated by existing gaps in firearms legislation. More alarmingly, sources indicate these weapons may have been used against South African soldiers deployed internationally.\n\nWhile authorities intercepted some weapons, including rocket launchers, before they left South African territory, intelligence sources confirm that numerous arms have successfully crossed borders and are currently deployed in active conflict zones. Officials also express concern about the possibility of stolen military weapons being stockpiled for potential use against the state.\n\nA National Prosecuting Authority letter from August last year, addressed to the Western Cape police commissioner, details a comprehensive firearms investigation. The document emphasizes that removing the lead investigator could \"prove to be detrimental\" and reveals that the initial investigation has expanded significantly.\n\nThe letter specifically highlights how \"loopholes in the firearms legislation and regulations are used to facilitate trans-border smuggling of firearms\" from South Africa to other nations. It further notes that \"investigation is required into the import and export of firearms by individuals and/or arms dealers for illicit means,\" potentially violating South Africa's arms embargoes and international protocols.\n\n## Right-Wing Connections\n\nThe investigation uncovered potential links to right-wing groups. In December 2015, law enforcement discovered a cache of weapons during a raid in Bothasig, Cape Town, including:\n- Thousands of rounds of ammunition\n- Silencers\n- Various weapons\n- Nazi and AWB paraphernalia\n\nThe raid led to the arrest of Keith Conroy, 71, reportedly a former right-hand man to late AWB leader Eugene Terre'Blanche.\n\n## Underground Market\n\nBeyond conflict zones, sources indicate these weapons are being channeled into an underground collectors' market, where firearms used in actual combat command premium prices.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nA significant case involving SANDF weapons trafficking is pending in the Western Cape High Court. Businessman Irshaad Laher and arms dealer Alan Raves face charges related to a syndicate that allegedly diverted at least 2,000 firearms marked for destruction.\n\nThe amended indictment accuses Raves of stealing multiple weapons from the Durban Light Infantry between 2012 and 2015, including:\n- Vickers 7.62mm machine gun (nicknamed \"chainsaw\" for its devastating effect)\n- Vektor SS 77 machine gun (prototype model)\n- Gorjunov light machine gun\n- RPD light machine gun\n\nThe defendants face multiple charges, including racketeering, corruption, theft, and possession of prohibited firearms. Their next court appearance is scheduled for May 12.\n\n*The SANDF has not responded to requests for comment, while the SA Police Service has indicated they will provide a statement at a later time.*",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nThe recent guilty plea by Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI, coupled with his agreement to cooperate against his former employer, has sparked renewed discussions about presidential impeachment. While some commentators, including a CNN.com columnist and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Litman, suggest impeachment may be imminent, it's crucial to distinguish between bringing impeachment charges and successfully removing a president from office.\n\nDespite the developments in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation since May, the practical likelihood of a successful impeachment has arguably diminished. This paradox stems from impeachment being fundamentally a political process rather than a legal one.\n\nThe mathematics of impeachment are stark: A House majority must pass articles of impeachment, requiring\u2014if voted on today\u201422 Republican representatives to join a unified Democratic vote. Even if Democrats capture the House in the next election and pass articles independently, conviction in the Senate demands a two-thirds majority, necessitating approximately 15 Republican senators.\n\nSuch widespread Republican defection has become increasingly improbable, primarily because GOP voters have demonstrated unwavering loyalty to Trump despite controversial developments. According to Gallup polling:\n\n- 84% Republican approval when Mueller was appointed\n- 87% approval following Donald Trump Jr.'s Russia email revelations\n- 81% approval in late November\n- Never below 79% since inauguration\n\nConversely, Republican senators who have challenged Trump have faced severe political consequences. Consider:\n\n- Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona): After publishing criticism of Trump, his approval among Republican constituents plummeted, leading to his decision not to seek reelection\n- Senator Bob Corker (Tennessee): Following his pointed criticism of Trump's fitness for office, his support among Tennessee Republicans swung dramatically from +40 points in February to -12 points by October, similarly resulting in his retirement announcement",

        "Fran\u00e7ois Legault and his Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec (CAQ) have devised a cynical, divisive, and inhumane immigration policy, exploiting Canada's federal system to deflect responsibility for its harshest consequences.  L\u2019actualit\u00e9 magazine recently revealed the CAQ\u2019s plan, which threatens to expel immigrants after four years if they fail French and \"values\" tests.  However, the CAQ wouldn\u2019t conduct the expulsions themselves.  Lacking that authority, they would deny immigrants the Quebec selection certificate required for permanent residency and report them to Ottawa as being in the country illegally, leaving the federal government to handle the removals. This allows the CAQ to appear tough on immigration while blaming Ottawa for any resulting hardship.\n\nThis scheme mirrors the CAQ\u2019s approach to defining the very \u201cvalues\u201d immigrants are expected to uphold.  Instead of providing specifics, the CAQ has deferred the task to unelected civil servants, conveniently delaying any potentially controversial details until after the October election. Legault's waffling on the issue further underscores this lack of clarity.  For example, he publicly reversed his position on whether wearing a facial veil would constitute a failure of the values test within the same interview, echoing the indecision displayed by Liberal Justice Minister St\u00e9phanie Vall\u00e9e on similar issues last year.\n\nWhile some defend the CAQ policy by pointing to existing requirements for immigrants to sign a declaration promising to respect Quebec values and learn French, these comparisons are misleading.  The declaration is signed *before* arrival, not after years of settling in.  And while applicants for Canadian citizenship must pass a test, failure does not lead to expulsion.  The CAQ\u2019s policy, on the other hand, threatens to uproot settled immigrants after years of contributing to Quebec society, subjecting them to prolonged uncertainty and stress.\n\nLegault\u2019s policy is not only inhumane but also deeply divisive.  It stigmatizes immigrants as threats to Quebec's language and values, playing on anxieties for electoral gain. He blames immigrants for potential integration challenges, ignoring systemic discrimination and refusing to acknowledge its well-documented existence.  Ultimately, this policy sends a clear message to immigrants: you are not welcome here. This may be the one area where the policy proves \u201csuccessful,\u201d as it could deter immigration to Quebec, achieving the CAQ's stated objective of reducing immigration numbers.\n\nIn short, Legault's immigration policy is a cynical ploy designed to appeal to nativist sentiments while shirking responsibility for its consequences. It\u2019s a strategy that preys on fear and division, ultimately harming both immigrants and Quebec society as a whole.\n\n\ndmacpgaz@gmail.com\nTwitter: DMacpGaz",
        "Following the division of their households, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle formally separated from the Royal Foundation, the charity they previously shared with Prince William and Kate Middleton.  A recent report reveals that all references to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been removed from the charity's website.\n\nThe *Daily Mail* reports that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are now listed as the sole principals of the Royal Foundation, with the Duke of Cambridge further designated as its founding member.  Originally launched in 2009 by Princes William and Harry to support the charitable endeavors of the British Royal Family, the organization later welcomed Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle as patrons after their respective marriages.\n\nThe website has been purged of not only their names but also any mention of the Sussexes' projects.  Prince Harry's Invictus Games and the community cookbook he launched with his wife, previously featured under the \"Programmes\" section, have been removed.\n\nThe homepage now features only the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  The charity's programmes are categorized under five headings: mental health, conservation, service, young people, and early years.

        "The Lok Sabha passed the GST (Compensation to States) Amendment Bill, 2017 on Wednesday, increasing the cess on luxury vehicles from 15% to 25% to compensate states for revenue losses after the GST rollout.  The bill replaces a September ordinance enacted for the same purpose.  Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, responding to a short debate, confirmed the increased cess revenue would be used for state compensation. He highlighted that the GST Council, including state finance ministers, meets monthly to rationalize taxes based on revenue collection.\n\nDuring the debate, members advocated for reduced GST rates on various items like sanitary napkins, agricultural equipment, handicrafts, handloom products, and sports goods. Some even proposed a single GST slab instead of the current four.\n\nHowever, the debate was disrupted by uproar from the opposition, specifically the Congress and TMC, over controversial comments made by Union Minister Anant Kumar Hegde regarding secularism and the Constitution.  At a Karnataka function on Sunday, Hegde reportedly questioned the identity of those who call themselves secular without acknowledging their religious background, and also declared an intent to change the Constitution.\n\nParliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar attempted to defuse the situation, claiming Hegde's remarks were being distorted, but this failed to appease the opposition, who continued their protests and demanded Hegde's resignation, forcing four adjournments.\n\nDespite the disruptions, the discussion on the GST bill continued.  BJD member Bhartruhari Mahtab noted that the full impact of GST on the exchequer would be clear after January, once implementation stabilized. He revealed that the center had provided over \u20b91,000 crore in compensation to Odisha and \u20b92,000 crore to West Bengal in the past three months.

On Wednesday, President Sergio Mattarella moved swiftly to address the situation, asking former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi to form a new government.  Mattarella\u2019s action followed the collapse of outgoing Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte\u2019s coalition government on Tuesday evening.  The president stressed the urgency of the situation, warning that Italy risked missing out on over 200 billion euros ($243 billion) in European Union recovery funds if a new government wasn't formed immediately.\n\nDraghi, renowned for his role in saving the euro zone from collapse in 2012, accepted the mandate.  Expressing confidence in securing parliamentary backing, he acknowledged the challenges ahead: \u201cThis is a difficult time. Beating the pandemic, completing the vaccination campaign, offering answers to the everyday problems of the people and relaunching the country are the challenges we face.\u201d  He emphasized the opportunity presented by the EU funds: \u201cWe have extraordinary European Union resources at our disposal, we have the opportunity to do so much for our country.\u201d\n\nInvestors reacted positively to Draghi's appointment, with Italian borrowing costs poised for their largest single-day drop since June and the Milan bourse blue chip index rising 2.5%.  However, securing the necessary political support is far from guaranteed. The 5-Star Movement, the largest party in parliament, immediately declared its opposition, potentially complicating Draghi's efforts to form a stable government.\n\nDraghi, nicknamed \u201cSuper Mario\u201d for his decisive actions at the ECB, where he famously pledged to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro, had largely been out of the public eye since leaving the ECB in October 2019.  His return to the political stage comes as Italy faces a confluence of crises.  As the first European country hit by the coronavirus, Italy has suffered over 89,000 deaths, the sixth-highest toll globally.  Lockdowns implemented to control the virus have ravaged the economy, resulting in an 8.8% GDP contraction in 2020, the steepest decline since World War Two.",

        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves the logical flow and creates a more coherent narrative:\n\n# All Blacks' Post-Match Analysis: Lessons from Bledisloe I\n\n## Game Review and Tactical Missteps\n\nDespite securing a 33-25 victory in Bledisloe I, the All Blacks faced a rigorous review on Monday where players were held accountable for their performance. Aaron Smith revealed the team's tactical shortcomings during their analysis.\n\n\"We had a plan around how we wanted to exit and get our forwards in the game early,\" Smith told The Breakdown on Sky. \"But there was just so many opportunities. We fell into that trap of, 'we could go on here, it's hot here, we could do this'.\"\n\nSmith emphasized what should have been their approach: \"We should have really got our forwards into the game, getting our loose forwards carrying early, cleaning rucks fast. And as you saw the first plays after halftime were direct, at them, we're coming. That sets our game up. Our game drivers won't do that again.\"\n\n## Leadership and Responsibility\n\nWhile Smith disclosed his role in the defensive group during games, he noted that offensive messaging responsibility lies with the No 10s. This insight highlighted the need for improvement from the No 10-No 12-No 15 axis of Richie Mo'unga, David Havili, and Damian McKenzie. Looking ahead to Saturday's match, expectations are high for either Mo'unga or Beauden Barrett to deliver a more measured first-half performance, likely incorporating more tactical kicking to pressure the Wallabies.\n\n## Performance Analysis\n\nDespite the criticism, Smith found positives in their performance, noting that the Wallabies only gained momentum through All Blacks' errors:\n\n\"Our intensity was there, because we were so eager and ready for a physical battle, but maybe early on skills, our ability to see space, and maybe respecting the ball a bit, and respecting the Australians with their defence as well was missing in that first half.\"\n\nHe added, \"The only reason we were under pressure was because we let them off the hook. We were putting them under so much pressure at set-piece time, but we were unable to capitalise.\"\n\n## Advice for Young Players\n\nSmith offered valuable guidance for younger squad members regarding media attention and performance reviews. With modern players facing intense scrutiny, particularly through social media, Smith emphasized the importance of maintaining perspective:\n\n\"It comes with time, and the old factor of, 'do you read all your press, or do you read none?' If you do one or the other you've got to have a plan around it. If you read a lot of the articles, you've got to read the bad ones too. Take it for what it is.\"",

        "Thomas Wayne Capenhurst, a Dixon man, pleaded guilty in a Sacramento federal court on Monday to the conspiracy to bomb his brother's home in Suisun City in 2018. According to U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott, Capenhurst pleaded guilty to both the conspiracy charge and malicious use of explosive materials.\n\nCourt documents revealed that Capenhurst had offered $10,000 each to co-defendant Robert McGraw and another man to place pipe bombs at his brother's Blue Jay Drive residence.

        "Manchester City\u2019s 2-1 loss to Lyon on Wednesday, their fourth consecutive Champions League defeat, lays bare the challenge facing the Premier League champions.  Despite racking up 100 points domestically last season and being tipped as favorites for the European title, City struggled in front of a partially empty Etihad Stadium.  The 15,000 empty seats highlight the nagging question of when the Champions League will capture the imagination of the club's fans and players alike.  While other contenders like Liverpool, Real Madrid, and Juventus thrive on fervent home support in European competition, City have yet to cultivate a similar atmosphere. This lack of home advantage is a stark contrast to their domestic dominance. Pep Guardiola's absence due to suspension was cited as a contributing factor to the loss, but the reality remains that City are the first English club to lose four straight Champions League matches, three of which were at home. This disappointing streak underscores the significant hurdle they face in translating their Premier League success to the European stage.",

This continued prominence was reflected in the annual poll of the Religion News Association (RNA), reported by the Religion News Service (RNS).\n\n\"Evangelicals are strongly represented in President Trump's cabinet and religious advisory board, shaping administration priorities ranging from Jerusalem to Supreme Court appointments to interpretations of religious liberty,\" stated RNS President Manya Brachear Pashman.\n\nStephen Strang, author of *God and Donald Trump*, noted that a large majority of evangelicals remain aligned with the president, attributing this loyalty to fulfilled campaign promises. These include strengthening religious liberty protections, appointing a conservative Supreme Court justice, supporting pastors and churches, and prioritizing the American family.\n\nPashman added, \"These so-called 'Trumpvangelicals' enjoy unprecedented access to the Oval Office, facilitated by Vice President Mike Pence, a conservative Christian, and an informal advisory panel composed almost entirely of conservative evangelical Christian leaders.\"\n\nThe RNA's top 10 religion stories of 2018 also included:\n\n* **Charlottesville white supremacist march:** Neo-Nazis brandishing anti-Semitic slogans were met with resistance from various religious groups.\n* **The travel ban:**  While the Trump administration framed the travel ban as a national security measure, critics deemed it anti-Muslim.\n* **Jerusalem:** Trump's official recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital drew praise from many Jewish leaders and Israel supporters, but faced international condemnation, with 128 nations in the UN General Assembly declaring the decision \"null and void.\"\n* **Rohingya atrocities:**  Myanmar's Buddhist majority persecuted its Rohingya Muslim minority, forcing over 500,000 to flee the country.\n* **Sutherland Springs church shooting:** The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history claimed the lives of 26 parishioners.\n* **Judge Roy Moore's Senate run.**\n* **Conservative judicial nominees:**  Including the appointment of Neil Gorsuch.\n* **NFL national anthem protests:**  Player protests during the national anthem sparked backlash from fans and viewers.\n* **500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation.**\n\nWhile not in the top 10, the *Masterpiece Cakeshop* Supreme Court case, addressing religious liberty, ranked 11th.\n\nTrump himself was named Religion Newsmaker of the Year, surpassing Pope Francis, Martin Luther, and Judge Roy Moore.\n\nStrang, a charismatic evangelical, acknowledged that many evangelicals initially opposed Trump's candidacy.

        "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 Growing tensions in the Middle East have sparked fear and frustration here at home. Dozens of people gathered downtown on Friday evening to protest the U.S. drone strike that killed one of Iran\u2019s top military leaders, General Qasem Soleimani. The rally was organized by the Democratic Socialists of America of Portland.\n\nDespite Terry Schrunk Plaza in downtown Portland being 2,350 miles from the White House, distance was irrelevant to those who assembled there on Friday night. \u201cWe\u2019ll do anything to stop the Trump administration from escalating this into a full-blown war,\u201d said protester Mark McLeod. \u201cI knew from the moment I heard about this last night that this is a terrible, terrible thing.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump hailed the operation as a victory. The U.S. officially classified Soleimani as a terrorist, accusing him of orchestrating covert operations that killed hundreds of U.S. troops in Iraq after the 2003 invasion. \u201cSoleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him,\u201d President Trump stated.\n\nHowever, some fear this week's events could spark another conflict in the Middle East. Protester Justin Allen expressed his concerns, stating, \u201cIf we're not out here shouting stuff, who will?\u201d Allen, who joined the Navy after 9/11, reflected on the Iraq war with a changed perspective. \u201cWe just kept sending more and more kids off to die, and I don\u2019t want that to happen again because this guy in the White House needs a news cycle distraction from all the crimes he and his friends keep committing,\u201d Allen said.\n\nIn response to similar criticisms, President Trump countered, \u201cWe took action last night to stop a war.

        "Here's a restructured version of the article with improved flow and clarity:\n\n# Manchester United Eye French Star Rabiot as Potential Pogba Replacement\n\nAccording to French outlet L'Equipe, Manchester United are targeting PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot as a potential replacement for Paul Pogba, amid strong speculation linking the latter with a summer move to Real Madrid.\n\n## Pogba's United Journey\nPaul Pogba, who rejoined United from Juventus in 2016 for a then-record transfer fee, has enjoyed a successful stint at Old Trafford, winning both the EFL Cup and UEFA Europa League under Jose Mourinho. Despite occasional criticism from his former manager, Pogba has demonstrated his world-class abilities, particularly this season, contributing 15 goals and 9 assists across all competitions.\n\n## Real Madrid's Interest\nReal Madrid, following a disappointing season, are keen to secure Pogba's services as part of Zinedine Zidane's squad overhaul. However, reports suggest Los Blancos are hoping to offer a lower salary package than the midfielder's current earnings at United.\n\n## The Rabiot Option\nUnited's interest in Rabiot comes at an opportune time, as the PSG midfielder will become a free agent at the season's end. The 2018-19 campaign has been challenging for Rabiot, who has made just 14 appearances for the Parisian club. With no intention of extending his contract, the French midfielder is set to depart PSG this summer.\n\n## Competition for Signature\nWhile L'Equipe is considered reliable for French football news, United face significant competition for Rabiot's signature. Several top clubs, including Barcelona, Manchester City, and Liverpool, are also pursuing the talented midfielder. United's absence from next season's Champions League could potentially impact their chances of securing the deal.\n\n## What's Next\nManchester United will conclude their 2018-19 campaign this Sunday at Old Trafford against Cardiff City, after which attention will turn to their summer transfer activities.\n\n*Source: L'Equipe (via English publication)*\n\n*Author: Jyotirmoy Halder*",

        "During a Senate committee hearing, Senator Wong raised concerns about whether the Prime Minister had requested the inclusion of Pastor Brian Houston at a White House state dinner. \"I think the public has a right to know whether our Prime Minister asked for Mr Brian Houston to go to the White House,\" she stated, emphasizing the need for transparency. \"And if he did so, he should be, frankly, man enough and brave enough to answer the question.\"\n\nThe state dinner, held on September 20, was attended by prominent Australians like Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest. However, Brian Houston was not present, and the government has neither confirmed nor denied if his invitation was suggested by the Prime Minister or his staff. At the Senate estimates hearing, Senator Wong inquired if Australia provided a list of potential attendees, but officials avoided direct responses.\n\nAn official from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet explained, \"Senator, I think any matters relating to the compilation or consideration of the guest list for a state dinner provided by the US would be a matter that might impact on international relations.\" Senator Wong expressed her disbelief, \"You've got to be kidding,\" while Finance Minister Mathias Cormann interjected, stating that the dinner arrangements were the responsibility of the US.",
        "Bentson wants to facilitate civil discussions on politics and bridge the divide between people with differing viewpoints. He created Neighbor to Neighbor (N2N) as a grassroots effort to bring together individuals who self-identify as conservatives, liberals, Democrats, Republicans, or independents. The goal of N2N is not to persuade or convert but to foster mutual understanding and respectful dialogue among neighbors.\n\nTo kick off his N2N initiative, Bentson set up in Pioneer Park with a sign inviting passersby to talk politics. While the response has been slow, he remains committed to the idea of encouraging meaningful conversations and reducing political polarization in society. By getting people with diverse perspectives in the same room, Bentson hopes to create a space for open dialogue where differences can be explored and common ground can be found.\n\nBentson's motivation stems from the current toxic political climate where disagreements often lead to division and animosity. He believes that avoiding political conversations only perpetuates the problem and that engaging in respectful dialogue, even with those we disagree with, is crucial for finding solutions to shared challenges. By promoting Neighbor to Neighbor as a platform for civil discourse, Bentson aims to counter the prevailing trend of demonizing those with opposing views.\n\nDespite the initial challenges of attracting participants, Bentson remains optimistic about the potential for N2N to spark meaningful discussions and reconnect individuals on a human level. His vision is for N2N groups to provide a safe and inclusive environment where people can express their thoughts and feelings while actively seeking to understand those of others. Through this process of dialogue and empathy, Bentson believes that communities can move towards greater unity and cooperation in addressing common problems.\n\nIf you are interested in joining the Neighbor to Neighbor groups or supporting this initiative, Bentson encourages you to reach out to him via email at sbentson@gmail.com. By engaging in civil discourse and embracing diversity of thought, N2N offers a pathway towards fostering understanding and collaboration among individuals with varying political beliefs.",

        "Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones owes a debt of gratitude to Capt. Norm Leong of the Sacramento Police Department for averting a potential disaster. Leong intervened to prevent two young men, carrying placards with the image of a deputy killed on Monday, from confronting Black Lives Matter (BLM) protesters during a demonstration in downtown Sacramento on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nLeong, with composure, blocked the path of these men as they approached BLM protesters who were shutting down J Street in front of the Sacramento Convention Center. He, along with other Sacramento city officers, ensured that these individuals and other pro-law enforcement demonstrators did not engage physically with the BLM demonstrators outside the annual conference of the California Peace Officers Association.\n\nHad this protest escalated into violence, bloodshed, or mass arrests, the residents and workers of Sacramento would have rightly questioned Jones' actions and intentions.\n\nStay informed. We provide unparalleled coverage of local events in our community. With a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP!\n\nOn Monday, while addressing the media about the death of one of his officers, Jones urged those who support law enforcement to head to the convention center, anticipating BLM protests on Tuesday, six months after the shooting of Stephon Clark.\n\nOpinion\n\u201cWe have a planned protest tomorrow at a statewide law enforcement conference in Sacramento,\u201d Jones stated. \u201cI know people have this overwhelming urge to do what they can. ... One of the things you can do is go down there. Go down to the convention center tomorrow between 11 and 1 and show your support for law enforcement.\u201d\n\nWhat did Jones expect? Emotions were already running high over the shooting death of Deputy Mark Stasyuk, a 27-year-old killed on Monday during a routine call in Rancho Cordova.\n\nChoosing such a solemn moment to make a political statement under the guise of a call to action was ill-timed. And people responded. Groups, mainly older individuals, some carrying American flags and a couple wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats similar to those worn by President Donald Trump, gathered to support law enforcement and confront BLM.\n\nThe BLM group included clergy, a mix of white and African American individuals, and a diverse array of supporters. The pro-law enforcement side was primarily composed of older white individuals, along with some younger participants. I didn\u2019t stay for the entire event, but I witnessed the tensest moments firsthand.\n\nThis clash of ideologies was on the verge of exploding.\n\nAs Leong worked to maintain peace, Jones' office issued a clarification on his earlier comments: \u201cSheriff Jones never called for a counterprotest\u2014which would encourage responding persons to protest or address the planned protest directly\u2014but rather gave the community an outlet for their grief and support where over a hundred Sheriff\u2019s Department personnel and law enforcement from around the state will be gathered to learn better ways to police their communities.\u201d\n\nReally?\n\nRe-read what Jones said on Monday and determine his true intent. It seemed like he was trying to correct one misstep by making another.",

        "Claudio Ranieri has strongly criticized Aboubakar Kamara for displaying disrespect towards his Fulham teammates, supporters, and the club by disregarding instructions and taking a crucial penalty, which he missed, potentially jeopardizing their victory against Huddersfield.\n\nFulham ultimately secured three vital points with a 1-0 win, thanks to Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s stoppage-time goal. Earlier in the match, Kamara ignored Mitrovic, the club\u2019s designated penalty taker, opting to take the penalty himself, which was subsequently saved by Huddersfield's Jonas Lossl at 0-0.\n\nKamara had previously scored from the penalty spot in a 4-1 defeat against Manchester United earlier this month. However, the normally composed 67-year-old Ranieri was visibly upset that Kamara \u201cthought only of himself\u201d and suggested he might consider dropping him from the team for his actions, which Ranieri claimed he had never encountered before.\n\nRanieri expressed his frustration, stating, \u201cIt is not possible to explain what happened after we got the penalty, or maybe I should say it is easy when a man thinks only of himself. It is not right. He didn\u2019t respect me, the club, his teammates, the crowd. He took the ball and just said, \u2018I want to shoot.\u2019 He didn\u2019t listen to reason.\u201d\n\nRanieri continued, \u201cI have spoken a little to him. I think he didn\u2019t understand what I said. Mitrovic was the designated taker, but Kamara scored our last penalty and took it on himself, \u2018I am the man.\u2019 He did not apologize, he just told me \u2018I wanted to shoot.\u2019 I said to him, \u2018If the whole team just said I want to shoot, what would happen?\u2019 It is impossible to speak to this man.\u201d\n\nRanieri further lamented, \u201cHe did not understand the reason; for him, everything is fine, we won the match. It is unbelievable; the first time in my life I have seen that. I understand why the fans might boo him, but of course, it is better if the fans and us are altogether. You must respect the nominated taker.\u201d\n\nConsidering Kamara\u2019s future in the team, Ranieri said, \u201cI hope he can understand; it is clearly difficult. I don\u2019t know if that is it, if it is finished or if it will continue. Maybe I will take him away from the squad. But I will do what is best for the squad. If it is good for them, he plays. If I think it isn\u2019t, he comes out. We\u2019ll play the Arsenal match on Tuesday, then I decide. The other players are calm because we won \u2013 but not me. It is not important whether we won or lost, it is important what you did and why.\u201d\n\nMitrovic\u2019s last-minute goal left Huddersfield at the bottom of the Premier League, having lost all seven of their league fixtures this month. Their manager, David Wagner, reflected on their current situation, saying, \u201cObviously it\u2019s a low point. Not only because we\u2019ve lost seven in a row but how we lost it. It\u2019s a heavy loss we\u2019ve conceded at Fulham. We will need for sure a little bit longer than only 30 minutes afterwards to deal with it. December wasn\u2019t our month, obviously. But for me, it\u2019s not possible to think so quickly after the game about the transfer window or the next game. I have to reflect. It\u2019s very difficult.\u201d\n\nPress Association",

His story exemplifies triumph over physical challenges and society's expectations.\n\n## Professional Journey\nOur correspondent, who encountered Ikoro at the Eastern Mass Transit Terminal in Holy Ghost Enugu on December 27, 2020, witnessed his remarkable ability to manipulate the vehicle's controls. His exceptional driving skills, demonstrated over six years in the profession, have earned him recognition as one of the most respected commercial drivers in the southeast region.\n\nBefore becoming a driver, Ikoro worked as a building engineer and solar light installer.

The park hosted a public viewing event, featuring bounce houses, an EVAC helicopter appearance, and live animal displays, all free of charge.\n\nPark rangers noted meeting visitors who traveled from as far as Indiana, New York, and Michigan to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Among the attendees was A.J. Grott, who had eagerly anticipated the eclipse for over a year and journeyed with his family from Memphis. \"If you have a chance for 2024 or you had a chance here, if you didn\u2019t take it, you should\u2019ve,\" said Grott, an eclipse enthusiast. \"If you have a chance next time, take it, 'cause it\u2019s indescribably awesome.\"\n\nThe climax of the event occurred around 1:21 p.m., when Paris Landing experienced 99 percent totality of the eclipse. For those who missed this spectacle, the next total eclipse will occur on April 8, 2024, or August 21, 2045.",
        "Rodney Rice entered his home state of West Virginia on a Sunday afternoon. The singer-songwriter from Littleton had just left Nashville after spending four days in a recording studio, marking his first proper visit to the country music hub. He was en route to visit family and install a kayak rack on his vehicle.\n\nDespite the unconventional timing for travel, Rodney had been isolated for months and was eager to record new songs. Despite the challenges of the year, he remained productive. \n\n\"I\u2019m adhering to safety measures, wearing a mask, and carrying hand sanitizer,\" Rice said. \"Everyone in the studio was diligent about it too, we were all masked up. I\u2019m just trying to make my way across the country as safely as possible.\"\n\nRodney was thrilled that his upcoming second album, SAME SHIrT, DIFFERENT DAY, set to release on streaming platforms on October 23, was gaining attention. The album, labeled as \u201cBubblin\u2019 Up\u201d on the Americana Music Association\u2019s chart, features twelve tracks of gritty, twangy country-rock with an array of guest musicians. The songs touch on themes like critiquing the current presidential administration and the struggles of a corporate job.\n\nThis album follows his 2014 debut, Empty Pockets and a Troubled Mind. Rodney felt more at ease in the studio this time around and found inspiration in the tumultuous state of the world.\n\n\"I prefer the second one,\" he remarked. \"The songs feel more current and relevant. The first album included some of the earliest songs I had ever written, spanning from high school to the recording session. It covered a broader time frame.\"\n\nThe opening track of SAME SHIrT, DIFFERENT DAY, titled \u201cAin\u2019t Got a Dollar,\u201d delves into the presidency of Trump and the notion that politics often revolves around money. Rodney expressed his embarrassment over having a reality TV star as the country's leader, incorporating military references influenced by his family and friends' military service.\n\nRodney's upbringing in West Virginia, with its blend of city life and rural surroundings where darkness descends early in the \u201chollers,\u201d has shaped his musical style. He believes Appalachia shares common daily life aspects across regions like West Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, emphasizing the value of diverse experiences.\n\nAfter returning to West Virginia to attend the University of West Virginia for a degree in geology, Rodney spent years in the oil industry before transitioning to focus on his music full-time. His time in Texas on oil rigs influenced his music, with songs like \u201cMiddle Managed Blues\u201d drawing from his corporate job experiences.\n\nMoving to Colorado after meeting a woman from Boulder, Rodney immersed himself in music during his Texas days, watching performances by outlaw country legend Billy Joe Shaver, who played a significant role in Rodney's musical journey.\n\nRodney's early exposure to music, raiding his sister\u2019s collection of Uncle Tupelo, Waylon Jennings, and Shaver tapes and CDs, left a lasting impression. Attending a concert by John Prine at a young age further fueled his passion for music.\n\nSAME SHIrT, DIFFERENT DAY will be available on October 23.

        "Prince Turki Al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's former spy chief, addressed the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the International Peace Institute think tank on Friday.  He stated that Saudi Arabia is proud of its judicial system and will not accept an international investigation into the matter. This stance comes despite calls for an independent probe from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, human rights groups, and some government leaders.  The calls for an investigation followed Khashoggi's death at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on October 2.  Prince Turki expressed his expectation that the kingdom will fulfill its promise to reveal all the facts surrounding the case, including the whereabouts of Khashoggi's body.  He also noted a prior friendly relationship with Khashoggi, who served as the Saudi embassy spokesman during Turki's ambassadorships to the United States and Britain.",
        "West Coast premiership big man Nathan Vardy seems to have secured the spot as Nic Naitanui's ruck partner for round one of the AFL season. Naitanui made a successful return to the field in the pre-season match against Fremantle, recording 22 hit-outs from five possessions before coming off in the third quarter. This game was crucial for Naitanui, as it was his only match of the pre-season following a hamstring injury over the summer.\n\nGiven the return to full-length matches this year, West Coast is looking to provide more support for Naitanui in the ruck. Vardy, who didn't play in the AFL last year due to a serious leg condition, appears to be the likely choice to support Naitanui. With Bailey Williams nursing an ankle injury, Vardy's strong performance in the pre-season games puts him in a good position for a round-one call-up against Gold Coast.\n\nIn terms of Oscar Allen, his role in the team for the upcoming season remains uncertain. Allen was the primary ruck support for Naitanui last year, but the Eagles are considering using a recognized ruckman like Vardy or Williams in that role in 2021. Coach Adam Simpson mentioned that Allen has been versatile during the pre-season, alternating between roles in attack and defense. With the potential return of Josh Kennedy for round one, Allen may see more playing time in defense.\n\nThe Eagles are dealing with several injury concerns as they approach the start of the season. Star midfielder Tim Kelly missed both pre-season games due to a thumb injury but is expected to be fit for round one. Captain Luke Shuey sustained an ankle injury in the match against Fremantle but is likely to be available for the season opener. On the other hand, recruit Zac Langdon suffered a serious concussion and is unlikely to be selected for round one.\n\nFurthermore, onballer Elliot Yeo will be sidelined at the beginning of the season due to ongoing issues with osteitis pubis. Although there are options to consider, such as defender Harry Edwards, the Eagles are leaning towards a more traditional ruck setup for round one. With uncertainties surrounding the roles of players like Allen and Vardy, West Coast will continue to assess their options leading up to the start of the AFL season.",
        "The Arizona Cardinals recently reduced their roster to 52 players, leaving an open spot due to two players on the COVID list and one player returning imminently. The team will likely make further adjustments through waiver claims and free agents, but we now have a clear view of the initial 53-man roster.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the positions and players on the roster:\n\nQuarterbacks:\nThe top two quarterback spots were secure, with the decision revolving around whether Streveler would make the final 53. In today's NFL climate, having three capable quarterbacks is vital, especially given ongoing COVID concerns. The team values Streveler and may opt to keep him on the roster to avoid exposing him to waivers.\n\nRunning back:\nThe running back group consists of Chase Edmonds, James Conner, Eno Benjamin, and Jonathan Ward. The challenge ahead will be determining the depth chart and game-day activations among these four players.\n\nWide receivers:\nDeAndre Hopkins, A.J. Green, Christian Kirk, Rondale Moore, Andy Isabella, and Antoine Wesley comprise the wide receiver corps. While the Cardinals were expected to carry six receivers, some surprises emerged in the final selection, notably Wesley making the cut over others like Greg Dortch.\n\nTight end:\nDan Arnold, Maxx Williams, and Darrell Daniels form the tight end group, with Ross Travis a potential practice squad candidate.\n\nOffensive line:\nThe offensive line includes D.J. Humphries, Justin Murray, Rodney Hudson, Brian Winters, Kelvin Beachum, Josh Jones, Max Garcia, and Josh Miles. Once Justin Pugh returns from the COVID reserve, the line will be complete with nine linemen.\n\nDefensive line:\nJ.J. Watt, Rashard Lawrence, Jordan Phillips, Zach Allen, Leki Fotu, Corey Peters, and Michael Dogbe make up the defensive line group. Dogbe's presence on the roster was unexpected due to the numbers game, with the possibility of a seventh lineman being carried.\n\nOutside linebacker:\nChandler Jones, Markus Golden, Devon Kennard, Dennis Gardeck, and Victor Dimukeje are the outside linebackers. Gardeck's return from the PUP list required him to be on the roster, while Dimukeje's inclusion was not surprising given his preseason performance.\n\nInside linebacker:\nZaven Collins, Isaiah Simmons, Jordan Hicks, Tanner Vallejo, and Zeke Turner complete the inside linebacker group. Turner's special teams prowess adds depth to the position.\n\nCornerback:\nByron Murphy, Marco Wilson, Tay Gowan, and Luq Barcoo currently fill the cornerback spots, with Robert Alford set to return from the COVID list. Malcolm Butler's sudden retirement has left a gap to be addressed in the secondary.\n\nSafety:\nBudda Baker, Jalen Thompson, Deionte Thompson, and Charles Washington make up the safety group. The decision to cut three safeties, including established players like Chris Banjo and Shawn Williams, was unexpected but highlights the depth in this position.\n\nSpecialists:\nThe specialists\u2014Matt Prater, Andy Lee, and Aaron Brewer\u2014remain unchanged, with potential practice squad additions like punter Ryan Winslow for backup purposes.\n\nThe Cardinals' roster decisions reflect a mix of expected choices and surprising outcomes, setting the stage for further adjustments as the season progresses.",

        "Tanzanian President John Magufuli has confidently declared that his country has successfully eradicated coronavirus, attributing this achievement to the power of prayer, the efforts of local health officials, and frontline healthcare workers. He emphasized the importance of continued vigilance and precautionary measures despite the positive outlook.\n\nMagufuli's remarks were made during a speech delivered at a church in Dodoma, the capital city of Tanzania, where he commended churchgoers for not wearing masks as a symbol of the country's victory over the virus and the diminishing fear among the population.\n\nWhile the President claimed that there were only four Covid-19 patients left in hospitals in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania has not reported any new data on coronavirus cases since April 29. The last available figures from the World Health Organization indicated 509 reported cases and 21 deaths in the country.\n\nConcerns have been raised by regional WHO officials regarding Tanzania's approach to social distancing and the decision to keep places of worship open despite the risks associated with large gatherings. The US Embassy in Tanzania issued a health alert in May, warning of the high risk of contracting Covid-19 due to overwhelmed hospitals in Dar es Salaam.\n\nPresident Magufuli initially downplayed the seriousness of the virus in Tanzania, urging citizens to rely on prayer to combat the disease and dismissing the reported increase in positive cases as a result of faulty test kits. Despite this, the country has started to ease coronavirus restrictions, with universities, high schools, and international travel resuming while primary and secondary schools remain closed.",

That is exactly what Kerri Lewis did a few weeks ago. I grow faint at the mere thought of it.\n\nMs. Lewis sat through the meeting, listening to the board's bickering and, according to her, watching most of the members act like spoiled children. This remarkable woman had no intention of speaking at the meeting but became so disturbed by the proceedings that she declared it \u201chorrible.\u201d\n\nWhen given the opportunity to speak, she had quite a lot to say, and she did. Her main purpose for attending these meetings, she said, was to see what everyone looked like and to hear what they said in person. \u201cI want them to know these purple glasses are listening every single time,\u201d she later told an Island Packet reporter.\n\nYou might have seen Ms. Lewis making her remarks on the Beaufort County Channel or on Facebook, as I did.

(Staff photo by Tony Baughman)\n\nLocated in the Leesville area of Lake Murray, Hollow Creek Distillery is a charming retreat where visitors can wander off the beaten path, enjoy warm Southern hospitality, and escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\n\nNestled in the trees, you'll find a quaint little red barn with white rocking chairs on the front porch. From there, you can sit back, relax, and gaze out at the wide expanse of the lake across Highway 378. Typically, on a springtime Saturday, guests could wander inside, learn about the art of moonshine-making, and savor some of Craig and Meredith Amick's handcrafted spirits.\n\nHowever, this spring is far from ordinary at Hollow Creek. Instead of welcoming guests and offering a taste of their fine Southern moonshine, Hollow Creek Distillery has pivoted to a life-saving mission.\n\nRecently, the Amicks received a call from the State of South Carolina, asking if they would be willing to use their moonshine still to produce hand sanitizer. Without hesitation, they agreed to assist their fellow South Carolinians on the front lines of the battle against the coronavirus.\n\n\"At first, we thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be very real,\" Meredith Amick remarked, standing next to Hollow Creek's substantial still. \"So, we had to make some adjustments here.\"\n\nFor two weeks straight, the Amicks worked tirelessly, putting in 14-hour days operating the moonshine still to meet the State's urgent request.

        "Louise Kenny, a professor of obstetrics and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, has witnessed the adverse impact of the Eighth Amendment on pregnant women with cancer. She emphasized that the Eighth Amendment casts a shadow over the care of women with complex medical needs in Ireland. In response to a previous opinion article by Prof Eamon McGuinness, Prof Kenny refuted claims that the Eighth Amendment does not endanger pregnant women's lives.\n\nProf Kenny cited the case of Michelle Harte, a woman who had to travel to Britain for an abortion while terminally ill with cancer. Despite being advised to terminate her pregnancy by doctors at Cork University Hospital, the hospital's ethics committee concluded that there was no immediate risk to Ms Harte's life and advised against termination.\n\nProf Kenny highlighted the challenges faced by pregnant women with cancer in accessing advanced cancer treatments that are often available only through clinical trials. She stressed the importance of having clear guidelines and legal interpretations to ensure timely and appropriate care for such patients.\n\nMs Harte's tragic case underscored the limitations imposed by the Eighth Amendment on women's healthcare choices. Despite the State providing substantial compensation to Ms Harte, she passed away in 2011. Prof Kenny urged for an open and respectful debate on the issue to ensure that decisions are made based on facts rather than opinions.\n\nIn conclusion, the Eighth Amendment has had real-life implications for pregnant women with cancer in Ireland. Prof Kenny's advocacy for the repeal of this amendment is rooted in her firsthand experiences of the obstacles it creates for women seeking essential medical care. The need for clarity, compassion, and evidence-based decision-making in women's healthcare cannot be overstated.",
        "Robert Lewandowski scored his second consecutive home hat-trick in the Bundesliga as 10-man Bayern Munich dominated Stuttgart 4-0, extending their lead at the top to four points. The Polish striker, who netted three times against Borussia Dortmund in his last league appearance at the Allianz Arena, needed just 39 minutes to replicate that performance here.\n\nSerge Gnabry also found the net in a commanding first half, as Hansi Flick's side overcame the early dismissal of Alphonso Davies to secure a resounding victory. Davies was sent off after VAR upgraded his yellow card to a red for a studs-up challenge on Wataru Endo.\n\nAfter weathering an early storm, Bayern took the lead through Lewandowski, who moved into second place on the Bundesliga's all-time top scorer list by converting Gnabry's low cross for his 269th goal in the competition.\n\n- Ten men\n- Four goals\n- Three points\n- Clean sheet\n- Job well done\n\n#FCBVfB 4-0 pic.twitter.com/fCxqUFC8a5 \u2014 FC Bayern English (@FCBayernEN) March 20, 2021\n\nGnabry then turned from provider to scorer, capitalizing on a slick exchange between Thomas Muller and Leroy Sane to finish a superb team goal. A minute later, Lewandowski's powerful header from Muller's right-wing cross put Bayern three goals ahead with less than a quarter of the game played. The prolific Pole completed his hat-trick just before halftime, seizing the ball inside the box and firing a left-footed shot into the bottom right corner, making it three goals from three shots.\n\nBayern's number nine should have added a fourth just past the hour mark but uncharacteristically misfired after being set up by Benjamin Pavard's low cross. However, that miss was inconsequential as the champions comfortably saw out their victory.\n\n**What does it mean? History beckons for Lewandowski**\n\nHaving already scored more Bundesliga hat-tricks than any other player, Lewandowski added a 13th here, extending his lead over Mario Gomez (10) to three. The Pole now has 35 league goals this season and is likely aiming to break Gerd Muller's record of 40 goals in a single Bundesliga campaign, with eight games remaining. In fact, 'Der Bomber's' all-time scoring record of 365 goals doesn't seem out of reach for Lewandowski, who, at 32, still has several years at the top level.\n\n**Lewa stars for Bayern**\n\nBayern faced challenges even before losing Davies, but the game's complexion changed entirely when Lewandowski scored his first goal in spectacular fashion. The fact that the Polish international completed his hat-trick with just three shots speaks volumes about his quality in front of goal.\n\n**Davies errs again**\n\nWere it not for Lewandowski's brilliance, Davies' reckless early challenge could have made for a difficult afternoon for his teammates.",

This year's Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree was cut down in secret by a Newburgh landscaping company, Lynn Warren Lawn Maintenance & Landscaping, which was named as the company put in charge of the stealth operation. It took over a week of preparation, during which branches were tied down to allow the massive Norway Spruce to be safely cut and placed on a trailer for its journey to 30 Rockefeller Center.\n\nUnlike previous years, the 2020 tree wasn\u2019t selected from the Hudson Valley. Instead, it came from the yard of an Oneonta business owner known as \u201cDaddy Al\u201d Dick.

        "The tourism and sports minister, Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, emphasized that the number of Covid-19 cases in Phuket must reach zero before the reopening to foreign tourists on July 1 under the sandbox scheme. The Phuket sandbox scheme, designed for vaccinated tourists without quarantine, requires high standards, with the government aiming for zero cases on the island by the designated date.\n\nTo achieve this goal, the government is focused on accelerating inoculations, particularly in Bangkok, to attain herd immunity by the fourth quarter. Mr. Phiphat stressed the importance of reducing daily infections to below 200 by the end of the month to restore confidence in international tourism. Once the situation is under control, discussions for travel bubbles will resume with countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Laos, and Malaysia.\n\nNeighboring countries and the Chinese market, especially with the Golden Week Holiday in October, are being closely monitored. However, no country is willing to engage in a travel bubble discussion with Thailand while the infection rates remain high. If new cases continue to emerge in Phuket despite 70% vaccination coverage, further actions will be discussed with the Public Health Ministry.\n\nLooking ahead, the government plans to establish a tourism fund by collecting a fee of 300 baht from foreign tourists starting in January to provide emergency support for the industry. The fund, which has been approved by the National Tourism Policy Committee, aims to help the tourism sector deal with uncertainties in the future. If Thailand can attract 20.8 million visitors in 2022, it would generate 6.2 billion baht for the fund.\n\nIn terms of the sandbox initiative, 10 areas are set to participate in the fourth quarter, with some regions already partaking in the program. The government maintains its target of 3-4 million international tourist arrivals, assuming the sandbox scheme in pilot areas progresses as planned.",

        "In 2016, Level-5 made several mobile-related announcements, one of which was a smartphone port of the original *Yo-kai Watch* monster-collecting RPG.  Originally released for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2013, *Yo-kai Watch* saw a worldwide release through Nintendo in 2015.  The sequel, *Yo-kai Watch 2*, enjoyed a surge in popularity, but sadly, that marked the franchise's peak; it has since faded from the spotlight. I thoroughly enjoyed the 3DS *Yo-kai Watch* game, but the second entry was truly exceptional.  Even the *Yo-kai Watch* anime received a global release with dubs. Despite the 2016 announcement, *Yo-kai Watch* never made it to mobile platforms at the time, though it did receive a Nintendo Switch port, which I imported from the Japanese eShop. While a solid conversion, it lacked English language support.  You can view the original 2016 smartphone trailer [here](link-placeholder).",
        "Hugh Jackman, much like the character he portrays, is nearing the end of his tenure with the superhero realm. Once again, he's poised to don the muttonchops and CGI adamantium claws for his role in \"Logan.\" However, Jackman insists that this will be his final performance as Wolverine, promising to retire the cigar and claws for good. We've heard similar claims before, as it seems that every Wolverine appearance is touted as his last. But this time, Jackman assures us, he truly means it\u2014unless circumstances change.\n\nIn a conversation with ScreenRant about \"Logan,\" Jackman suggested there might still be one adventure left for him, albeit contingent on a nearly impossible collaboration between 20th Century Fox and Marvel Studios. He expressed, \"If [an Avengers movie] was on the table when I made my decision, it certainly would have made me pause. That\u2019s for sure. Because I always love the idea of him within that dynamic, with the Hulk obviously. [\u2026] At the moment, honestly, if I really did have [the Avengers] there, I probably wouldn\u2019t have said this is the last [movie].\"\n\nConsidering the logistical challenges, it's clear that coordinating rival movie studio executives is akin to corralling a bag full of wet cats\u2014it's chaotic and usually unproductive. However, the successful collaboration between Sony Pictures and Marvel for Spider-Man sets a precedent. If they could reach a custody arrangement, there's no reason Fox can't take similar steps. Even if Fox is hesitant to concede any control to Marvel, would they really leave potential profits on the table? With the Infinity Stones storyline, it\u2019s conceivable that Wolverine could be pulled into the Avengers universe for a movie or two.",

        "Oakland, California cosmetic surgeon Dr. Gabriel H. Patino provides skilled hair transplantation procedures for clients in Oakland, Berkeley, and surrounding areas of California at his practice, the Cosmetic Surgical Center of El Cerrito. Millions of Americans suffer from hair loss and may not know that there are many varieties of treatment available. The most effective solutions will be provided by a surgeon like Dr. Gabriel Patino, who is an experienced hair loss surgeon.\n\nHair transplant surgery provides immediate, visible results. During the procedure, hair is taken from an area of abundance on the head and replaced in the areas where hair loss has occurred. Up to 95% of transplanted hairs will remain alive and continue to grow and thicken. Since transplants will not prevent future hair loss or reverse the process of hair loss, Dr. Patino commonly suggests both hair transplant surgery and a regimen of Propecia. Some clients who are averse to taking prescription medication may benefit from a topical solution instead.\n\nThe Cosmetic Surgical Center of El Cerrito can treat current hair loss and help prevent future hair loss with the application of advanced techniques and technology. Dr. Patino and his team work closely with each client to provide specific treatment options best suited for their needs. Though over-the-counter solutions are available, including topical products like Minoxidil, that boast FDA approval, the results of such products can be unclear and widely varied. The medication in retail treatments is weaker than that found in prescription treatments, and the application process is messy, inconsistent and demanding. Certain orally taken medications like Propecia and Finasteride effectively reduce dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a testosterone byproduct that causes hair loss, and results are less noticeable than those of skilled hair transplant surgery.\n\nDr. Patino of the Cosmetic Surgical Center of El Cerrito specializes in a wide variety of advanced surgical and non-surgical cosmetic solutions, skin rejuvenation and hair restoration, helping clients achieve healthy, youthful, natural results.\n\nTo learn more about the services provided by Dr. Gabriel H. Patino at the Cosmetic Surgical Center of El Cerrito, visit them online at http://www.thecosmeticsurgicalcenter.com.",

        "Senator Chuck Schumer Outlines Democrats' Strategy for Barrett Hearing\n\nOn Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., detailed the Democrats' approach for the Judiciary Committee's hearing on Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination. Schumer emphasized two main focal points: the potential for Barrett to overturn the Affordable Care Act and what he described as the Republicans' hypocrisy in confirming a Supreme Court nominee so close to an election. \"We will concentrate on issues like women's reproductive rights, labor rights, climate change, and, above all, health care,\" Schumer stated during an appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"We're going to illustrate to the American people the potential damage posed by this nominee, who has expressed admiration for Antonin Scalia, whose philosophy could set us back 100 years.\"\n\nDemocrats plan to share personal stories from citizens across the country to highlight how Supreme Court decisions can profoundly impact Americans' lives. When asked about the possibility of Democrats expanding the Supreme Court should they win the presidency and regain control of the Senate, Schumer remained non-committal, stating, \"Everything will be on the table\" if that scenario unfolds.\n\nBarrett and Lawmakers Pay Tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\nIn her opening statement, Amy Coney Barrett paid tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom she is nominated to replace. \"When I was 21 and just starting my career, Ruth Bader Ginsburg sat in this seat. She told the committee that what became of her could only happen in America,\" Barrett said. \"I am nominated to fill Justice Ginsburg's seat, but no one will ever take her place. I am eternally grateful for the path she paved and the life she led.\"\n\nBefore Barrett's remarks, several of the 22 senators on the committee reflected on Ginsburg's historic tenure and judicial legacy. Committee Chair Lindsey Graham called Ginsburg \"an active litigator, advocating for equal justice and better rights for women,\" noting the friendship she shared with Scalia. Senator Dianne Feinstein recalled Ginsburg's confirmation hearing as a \"real thrill\" for a trailblazer who \"staunchly believed in a woman's right to full equality and autonomy.\" Senator Amy Klobuchar emphasized that Ginsburg's legacy could not be erased, saying, \"To the women of America, we have come so far, and in the name of RBG, we must not go backwards.\"\n\nDemocrats Emphasize Health Care on First Day of Barrett Hearing\n\nOn the first day of Supreme Court hearings, Senate Democrats delivered a unified message: Health care coverage and protections for millions of Americans are at risk if Barrett is confirmed.

Following protocol, he reported the find to the officer on duty at the airport's arrival car park and was directed to submit the items to ACHAN's secretariat.\n\n\"I never had it in mind to take someone's belongings because it would put sorrow in another family's life,\" Adeniyi explained.\n\n## The Passenger's Story\n\nThe passenger, Dele Ayeni, had just arrived from Cairo when he met Adeniyi. \"While on the way, I decided to drop my jacket on the floor of the car to avoid being noticed as an important man sitting in the rear seat of the car,\" Ayeni explained.\n\nThe loss wasn't immediately apparent to Ayeni. \"Unfortunately, I did not open my luggage to bring out what I had for my family members until after I woke up in the noon.

        "Here's the polished version of the article:\n\n# Internet Governance Conference Shifts Focus as US Signals Change\n\nA global conference on Internet governance in Brazil is expected to be less contentious than initially anticipated, following the United States' willingness to relax its control over key Internet functions.\n\nThe US has agreed to relinquish oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) - a California-based nonprofit responsible for managing domain names - responding to demands from Brazil and other nations following revelations of widespread electronic surveillance.\n\n\"The focus has shifted from a political reaction to the NSA allegations toward more constructive criticism and dialogue about the Internet's future,\" notes William Beer, a S\u00e3o Paulo-based cybersecurity expert.\n\nThe Net Mundial conference, a two-day event in S\u00e3o Paulo opening Wednesday under Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, will address several crucial topics:\n\n- Cybersecurity\n- Privacy protection\n- Freedom of expression\n- Future oversight of the decentralized network\n\nRepresentatives from diverse nations - including China, Cuba, the United States, and European countries - will participate. However, organizers emphasize that government officials will share equal standing with:\n\n- Internet companies\n- Academic institutions\n- Technical experts\n- Internet user advocacy groups\n\n\"All stakeholders deserve equal participation in this multi-stakeholder process,\" explains Virgilio Almeida, Brazil's IT policy secretary and conference chair.\n\nWhile the conference isn't expected to produce binding decisions, Almeida suggests it will initiate an important dialogue that will \"sow the seeds\" for future Internet governance reforms.\n\n## Background and Context\n\nThe conference emerges from controversy surrounding NSA surveillance programs, which targeted multiple world leaders, including:\n\n- Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff\n- German Chancellor Angela Merkel\n\nThese revelations, disclosed by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden, prompted international calls to reduce US control over the Internet - a network originally created 50 years ago to connect American universities with the defense industry.\n\n## ICANN Transition\n\nIn a surprising move last month, the US government announced plans to transfer ICANN oversight to an international body by September 2015. This transition comes with one crucial condition: the new organization cannot be under any government's control.\n\nThe debate over ICANN's future management likely represents a new point of contention, particularly with nations advocating for multilateral control through organizations like the United Nations.\n\nChina, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan have jointly proposed developing a UN-based Internet code of conduct. However, this proposal - originating from countries known for Internet censorship - is unlikely to gain widespread support at the conference.\n\n\"Most participants here favor a multi-stakeholder model for the Internet,\" Almeida told Reuters. \"China prefers a UN treaty approach, but the UN only represents governments.\"\n\n---\n\n*Originally reported by Reuters, with writing by Anthony Boadle and editing by Kieran Murray and Andre Grenon*",
        "Hiring in India has stagnated despite the country experiencing the fastest growth rate among the world's major economies.\n\nA ManpowerGroup survey of 5,110 employers found that only 16 percent plan to increase their workforce in the quarter ending in September. The survey focused on formal sector companies, defined as those employing ten or more workers.  Data on India's informal labor market, which employs the majority of the workforce, remains limited.\n\n\"Diversity, automated recruitment, virtual reality, and remote working options are major trends expected to drive recruitment in India in 2018,\" AG Rao, Group Managing Director of ManpowerGroup India, said in a statement Tuesday. The service sector and wholesale and retail trade anticipate the strongest hiring outlook, with 20 percent of respondents in these sectors indicating plans to hire in the September quarter.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government is relying on robust economic growth to generate jobs before the 2019 general elections.  GDP growth has accelerated for four consecutive quarters, reaching 7.7 percent in the quarter ending in March.\n\nModi's 2014 campaign promised the creation of 10 million jobs.  Four years later, the actual number of jobs created remains unclear.  Government data indicates that over 12 million Indians enter the workforce annually.\n\nWhile hiring isn't significantly increasing, data suggests that large-scale job losses are also absent.

        "Earlier this week, Khloe Kardashian addressed reports that she was dating Tristan Thompson while he was still involved with his now-ex, Jordan Craig, who was pregnant at the time. In an Instagram story, the \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" star explained that although she was aware of Craig's pregnancy, Thompson had referred to Craig as his ex and provided \"physical proof\" that they were no longer together.\n\nCraig reportedly claimed that Thompson began cheating on her just one month into her pregnancy. Kardashian and Thompson were first linked as a couple in September 2016, during which time Craig was six months pregnant. According to court documents obtained by Radar Online, Craig stated that she discovered Thompson's infidelity one month into her pregnancy. She confronted him, but he denied the allegations. Her suspicions were confirmed when she saw paparazzi photos of him with Kardashian, as per the documents.\n\n\"Their relationship went viral, and everything took a turn for the worse,\" Craig said in the court documents, according to Radar Online. \"Every day, several articles were published worldwide mocking my new unfortunate reality, and my pregnancy became one of the most popular gossip headlines due to the woman Tristan was now publicly dating during my pregnancy.\"\n\nKardashian acknowledged that she knew Craig was pregnant when she began dating Thompson, but he assured her that he and Craig had broken up. Kardashian shared her perspective in an Instagram Story on Tuesday night, stating that she went on a blind date with Thompson. The NBA player informed her that his ex, Craig, was pregnant. This revelation made Kardashian hesitant to pursue a relationship, but Thompson assured her that he and Craig were no longer together.\n\n\"He pleaded with me that the relationship was over long before we met. He had me talk with his closest circle,\" she wrote on Instagram, according to TMZ. \"He showed me physical proof (correspondence between the two) and had me on calls with his lawyer to prove his point. His best friends, business associates, and even his mother told me that he and his ex were broken up before we met.\"\n\nKardashian expressed her deep regret, stating she is \"so completely and utterly sorry\" if what she believed at the time was not true. \"Truthfully, from the deepest parts of my soul, I am sorry!\" she wrote. \"I'm sorry for any pain that has been caused. No woman deserves to go through anything like this.\"\n\nA representative for Kardashian declined to comment, and a representative for Thompson did not immediately respond to INSIDER's request for comment.",

        "The latest episode, \u2018Painful Evacuation\u2019, begins with Hannah interviewing a writer who advocates childlessness as an essential ingredient for being a committed writer. When she passes on this wisdom to Hannah, it becomes a ritualistic transfer of knowledge. However, the end of the episode offers a contrasting view. Despite being told to embrace childlessness, Hannah finds out she is pregnant when she visits the hospital due to a UTI. The doctor, someone she had a past encounter with, offers to fund her abortion, assuming that's what she wants. This highlights societal expectations and the stigma around single women and pregnancy, especially in conservative societies like India.\n\nIn a society where women often face pressure to prioritize child-rearing over their careers, it is disheartening that the burden of this choice primarily falls on women. Balancing motherhood and a career is a challenge faced by many, and it is essential to create a supportive environment that empowers women to pursue fulfilling professional lives without sacrificing their personal choices.\n\nReflecting on the portrayal of pregnancy on TV as a symbol of maturity, a writer expresses disappointment in how motherhood is equated with growing up. This perspective, while valid, seems to overlook the complexities faced by women in different societal contexts. In many parts of the world, especially in less privileged settings, the decision to continue a pregnancy as an unmarried woman may still be met with societal resistance, highlighting the diverse challenges women encounter based on their circumstances.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the decision to have children or not should be a personal choice, independent of societal expectations or stereotypes. Women, especially those navigating the complexities of singlehood in their thirties, should trust their instincts and not allow external opinions to diminish their sense of womanhood. Motherhood should not be viewed as a mandatory milestone but as a conscious choice that individuals should be free to make.\n\nThe portrayal of female agency and empowerment is a central theme in the HBO series \"Girls,\" where characters grapple with societal expectations and individual autonomy.",

        "On Monday, Dec. 13, a judge in Rochester Hills, Mich., declined the request to move 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, charged with killing four students and injuring others in a shooting at Oxford High School, out of an adult jail. Crumbley is charged as an adult with killing four classmates and injuring seven other people in the Nov. 30 shooting at Oxford High School, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit.\n\nDuring his probable cause conference, Crumbley\u2019s attorney, Paulette Loftin, argued that he should be moved back to a juvenile facility, stating that he \"should not be considered a menace to other juveniles.\" Loftin emphasized that Crumbley had no prior history of trouble and that the incident was isolated.\n\nAssistant Oakland County Prosecutor Marc Keast countered Loftin's argument, highlighting the severity of the charges and security concerns as reasons for Crumbley to remain in an adult facility. Keast emphasized that the shooting was not an isolated incident but a planned, premeditated mass murder targeting juveniles.\n\nJudge Nancy Carniak sided with Keast and ruled that Crumbley would remain in the adult jail. She adjourned the probable cause hearing to Jan. 7 to review witness statements and evidence. A competency exam may be ordered at a later date if requested by Crumbley's attorneys.\n\nThe school officials met with Ethan Crumbley and his parents on the morning of the shooting after a concerning drawing was found. Despite this, the Crumbleys refused to take their son home. James Crumbley had purchased the gun used in the shooting just days before, and their son had access to it.\n\nCrumbley's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, are also being held at the jail and face charges of involuntary manslaughter for failing to intervene on the day of the tragedy. Their hearings are scheduled for the following day, Tuesday.\n\nThe conference on Monday was a procedural hearing to prepare for a preliminary hearing set for Dec. 20, which will be rescheduled. Keast assured that steps would be taken to ensure Crumbley is separated from adult inmates at the jail to protect his safety.\n\nOverall, the court proceedings and decisions surrounding Crumbley's case reflect the gravity of the charges and the complexities involved in addressing such a tragic event.",

        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its scientific accuracy while improving readability and flow:\n\n# Antarctica's Hidden Heat: New Evidence Supports Mantle Plume Theory\n\nThree decades ago, a University of Colorado Denver scientist proposed an intriguing hypothesis: a mantle plume beneath Marie Byrd Land could explain both the region's volcanic activity and its distinctive topographic dome. Recent seismic imaging has now validated this theory, though it initially met with skepticism. \"I thought it was crazy,\" admitted H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Seroussi of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). \"The concept of such intense heat coexisting with an ice sheet seemed implausible.\"\n\nA groundbreaking NASA study has now provided compelling evidence for this geothermal heat source deep beneath Antarctica. While this mantle plume doesn't pose a new or escalating threat to the West Antarctic ice sheet, it offers crucial insights into two phenomena: the sheet's rapid collapse during previous periods of climate change and its current instability.\n\nThe ice sheet's stability depends heavily on its basal lubrication\u2014the water underneath that facilitates glacial movement. Understanding these subglacial water sources and their future behavior is crucial for predicting future ice loss to the ocean.\n\nBeneath Antarctica's bedrock lies an intricate network of rivers and lakes, including one that rivals Lake Erie in size. These water bodies exhibit dynamic behavior, with rapid filling and draining cycles that can cause the overhead ice surface\u2014thousands of feet thick\u2014to fluctuate by up to 20 feet (6 meters). These movements enable scientists to calculate the volume and distribution of subglacial water.\n\nGiven the scarcity of direct measurements beneath the ice, Seroussi and colleague Erik Ivins of JPL turned to numerical modeling. They employed the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), a sophisticated numerical representation of ice sheet physics developed by JPL and UC Irvine researchers. Seroussi enhanced the model to account for various heat sources and transport mechanisms, including:\n\n- Natural heating processes\n- Heat transport from phase changes\n- Frictional effects\n- Other thermal phenomena\n\nTo validate their model, the researchers utilized surface altitude data from NASA's IceSat satellite and Operation IceBridge flights. \"These observations provided crucial constraints on possible melt rates\u2014precisely what we aimed to predict,\" explained Ivins. The team ran numerous simulations testing various plume parameters, given the uncertainty about the mantle plume's exact location and dimensions.\n\nTheir findings revealed that the mantle plume's energy flux cannot exceed 150 milliwatts per square meter. For context:\n- Typical U.S. regions without volcanic activity: 40-60 milliwatts\n- Yellowstone National Park (average): 200 milliwatts\n- Individual geothermal features: Significantly higher\n\nThe simulations identified one exceptional area inland from the Ross Sea, characterized by intense water flows, requiring 150-180 milliwatts per square meter to match observations. Seismic data suggests this heat reaches the ice through a crustal rift, similar to Africa's Great Rift Valley.\n\nMantle plumes are theorized to be narrow streams of hot rock that rise through Earth's mantle, spreading mushroom-like beneath the crust. This concept, proposed in the 1970s, explains geothermal activity far from tectonic plate boundaries, such as in Hawaii and Yellowstone.",

However, the COVID-19 vaccines represent a departure from this established approach. Their unprecedented rapid global deployment has raised questions about both short-term and long-term effects on human immune system pathophysiology, with many scientists noting incomplete investigation of these impacts.\n\n## Adverse Events Reporting\nMajor adverse event databases, including the UK's Yellow Card Scheme and the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), have documented numerous post-vaccination outcomes. These range from anaphylactic reactions and myocarditis to fatalities. While some have dismissed these concerns, recent research has begun to validate several previously contested observations.\n\n## Key Research Findings\n\n### Genetic Expression Changes\nA recent study revealed consistent alterations in gene expression across various immune cell types, supporting concerns about genetic impacts. The research documented:\n\n- Changes in immune cell gene expression patterns\n- Modifications to inflammatory response mechanisms\n- Altered T-cell responses\n\n### Symptom Manifestation\nThe study examined healthy volunteers who received a double dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Researchers observed pathophysiological changes similar to those seen in actual SARS-CoV-2 infections, suggesting the vaccine may mimic infection patterns.\n\n### Immune System Effects\nSeveral significant findings emerged regarding immune system function:\n\n- Consistent reductions in CD8+ T cells, crucial for protective immunity\n- Increased monocyte levels, indicating immune system activation\n- Enhanced NF-\u03baB inflammatory signaling\n- Reduced Type I interferon responses 28 days post-vaccination\n\n## Statistical Context\nPublic Health England data from September 2021 indicated that of 600,000 cases studied, 57% occurred in vaccinated individuals. Additionally, research across 68 countries and 2,947 US counties suggested higher COVID-19-related hospitalization risks among vaccinated populations compared to those with natural immunity.\n\n## Broader Implications\nThe research indicates that vaccination influences multiple health indicators, including:\n\n- Diabetes-related markers\n- Renal function\n- Cholesterol metabolism\n- Coagulation parameters\n- Electrolyte balance\n\n## Conclusion\nThese findings suggest that post-vaccination immune system changes may create increased vulnerability to various health challenges, warranting further investigation and continued monitoring of long-term effects.\n\n[Note: This text presents research findings and reported data.

        "Round Rock \u2014 Unless there's a complete meltdown in the final days of the season, the Round Rock Express are headed to the playoffs next week. The Express (81-53) have put the San Antonio Missions (78-56) on the ropes by winning the first two games of their crucial series. Round Rock needed just four more wins to secure the division lead going into Wednesday night.\n\nManager Mickey Storey expressed confidence in his team but remained cautious, stating, \"I'm confident in my team, but not comfortable. Sure, I like our position. A lot of things can still happen, though. Until you've slammed the door shut, it's still open a crack.\"\n\nThe Express, boasting the best record in the Pacific Coast League, are so sure of their playoff spot that they have started selling tickets for the postseason. A best-of-five semifinal series against the Iowa Cubs (71-63) would kick off with games 1 and 2 at Dell Diamond next Wednesday and Thursday nights. The series would then move to Des Moines for the weekend.\n\nRound Rock will be without their star player for the playoffs as the Houston Astros announced the promotion of left fielder Kyle Tucker once major league rosters expand next week. Tucker, a member of the All-PCL Team, achieved a rare 30-home run/30-stolen base season, making him a standout player in the league's history.\n\nDespite the upcoming loss of Tucker, Round Rock has more immediate business to attend to. They will have the chance to clinch in their home finale on Thursday or in the season-ending series over Labor Day weekend against Omaha (57-76), which currently holds the worst record in the PCL.\n\nThe recent 6-0 and 4-3 victories on Monday and Tuesday, with stellar pitching from Jose Urquidy and Kent Emanuel and key contributions from Chas McCormick, have all but sealed the fate of the Missions. Round Rock secured the season series 9-5 and claimed the inaugural I-35 Traffic Cone trophy, crucial in potential tiebreaker scenarios.\n\nEmanuel's dominant performance, pitching a one-hit shutout over eight innings on Tuesday, showcased his importance in Round Rock's late-season surge. His precision and preparation have been vital in his success as a starter, boasting impressive stats both on the road and at home.\n\nThe playoff push has injected a new energy and intensity into the team, with McCormick leading the offense and emphasizing the team's depth and strength at this crucial juncture. Emanuel echoed this sentiment, acknowledging the shift in focus as the team approaches the end of the regular season.\n\nThe PCL playoffs have a set format, meaning Round Rock won't have home-field advantage against Iowa in the semifinals but would secure it if they progress to the championship series, with games three, four, and five set to take place at Dell Diamond on the weekend of September 13-15. The pinnacle of the Triple-A season, the one-shot title game, will be held on September 17 in Memphis.",
        "STOCKHOLM \u2013  Struggling chip joint venture ST-Ericsson, owned by Ericsson and STMicroelectronics, faces an uncertain future.  The two parent companies have enlisted an external advisor to explore strategic options for the loss-making unit.  This follows media reports that JP Morgan has been engaged to review possibilities, including finding a new partner, selling assets, or even a complete sale.  French newspaper Les Echos suggested a scenario where ST-Ericsson could be sold piecemeal, with technologies like connectivity, power management, and software architecture attracting different buyers.  Remaining parts of the business might be reabsorbed by the parent companies. While no decision has been announced, one is expected by the end of the year.\n\nST-Ericsson continues to struggle financially.  In the second quarter, it reported an operating loss of $235 million, attributed to the collapsing demand for feature phones from clients like Nokia and Sony Ericsson, and the challenging transition to supplying chips for the smartphone market.  The company\u2019s full-year 2011 loss totaled $841 million on sales of $1.65 billion, and it has accumulated losses of around $2 billion over its three years of operation.\n\nWhile Ericsson and STMicroelectronics have publicly stated their support for ST-Ericsson's ongoing cost-cutting initiatives aimed at lowering the break-even point, analysts are skeptical about the prospects of a sale.  \"The possibilities for Ericsson are limited except to hold on to its share and try and do the turnaround themselves,\" said Mirko Maier, analyst at LBBW. Finding a buyer for the entire business, or even substantial parts of it, appears challenging given its financial performance.\n\nAlthough a sale or break-up wasn't explicitly mentioned in the official statement from the parent companies, Ericsson's head of media relations confirmed that all options are under consideration.",

        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves its logical flow and coherence:\n\n# From Actor to Musician: A Conversation Between Ed Droste and Finn Wolfhard\n\n## Introduction\nWhile most know Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler from Netflix's \"Stranger Things,\" his Vancouver indie-rock band Calpurnia is far from a celebrity vanity project. The four young musicians have been playing together since before Wolfhard's rise to fame, drawing inspiration from both contemporary acts like Grizzly Bear, Mac DeMarco, and Twin Peaks, as well as classics like the Beatles, the Cars, and the Velvet Underground.\n\nWolfhard's success on \"Stranger Things\" opened doors in the music world. Through his castmate Joe Keery, he connected with Twin Peaks frontman Cadien Lake James, who went on to produce Calpurnia's debut six-track EP, \"Scout,\" at Twin Peaks' Chicago studio.\n\n## The Band's Formation and Creative Process\nIn a conversation with Grizzly Bear frontman Ed Droste, Wolfhard detailed Calpurnia's organic formation. It began when he met drummer Malcolm Craig on a PUP music video shoot, where they played younger versions of the band members. They later met guitarist Ayla Tesler-Mabe at a summer rock camp, and bassist Jack Anderson joined through Ayla's connection, completing the lineup.\n\nThe band operates as a true democracy, with all members contributing equally to the creative process. Songs typically start with one member's idea\u2014a riff, drumbeat, or lyrics\u2014and evolve through collaborative development. This approach extends to their studio work, where even their engineer and producer are treated as equal creative partners.\n\n## Balancing Acting and Music\nWolfhard maintains a clear distinction between his acting and musical pursuits, though he acknowledges some overlap in areas like stage presence and improvisation. He approaches both crafts with intense focus, using music as a therapeutic tool to organize his thoughts before and after acting.\n\n## Live Performance and Future Plans\nDespite having played only five shows, Calpurnia has ambitious plans for the future. While current touring is limited by school schedules and Wolfhard's acting commitments, they aim to conduct a full North American tour after releasing their album, when other band members complete school.\n\n## Musical Influences and Legacy\nThe band's sound reflects a diverse range of influences, from contemporary indie rock to classic bands. Wolfhard credits his parents for shaping 90% of his musical foundation, particularly his father's eclectic taste, which introduced him to everything from the Beatles to Future Islands.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe conversation between Droste and Wolfhard reveals Calpurnia as a serious musical endeavor, grounded in genuine passion and collaborative spirit. Despite the challenges of balancing multiple creative pursuits and educational commitments, the band maintains a clear vision for their future in music.\n\n*Calpurnia's Scout EP was released on June 15 via Royal Mountain Records.*",
        "Nine firefighters and three vehicles from the Lebanon Fire District have been actively combating the Beachie Creek wildfire over the past week. The firefighters were dispatched on Tuesday, September 8, joining other crews in 12-hour shifts to combat the blaze that has ravaged communities in the Santiam Canyon. The Lebanon firefighters are directly involved in fire attack operations and are providing structural protection and evacuation support.\n\nLebanon Fire Chief Joseph Rodondi mentioned that the department is collaborating with neighboring fire departments in Scio and Sweet Home. Lebanon crews are backing up these departments, which are more heavily engaged in fighting the fires threatening their communities. \"We are in constant contact with our partner agencies in Scio and Sweet Home,\" Rodondi stated.\n\nTo meet these demands, Rodondi noted that the Lebanon department has relied heavily on its full-time and volunteer firefighters. \"We have increased our staffing levels this week,\" Rodondi remarked.\n\nIn addition to firefighting efforts, the department is committed to ensuring the public receives the most accurate and up-to-date information available. Rodondi emphasized that the Linn County Sheriff's Office is the most reliable source for updates on the fires and current evacuation levels and zones. \"I encourage people to visit the Linn County Sheriff's Office website,\" Rodondi advised. \"The most important thing is to have accurate, consistent information.\"",

        "LARWILL, Ind. (WANE) \u2013 Whitko Community Schools have announced they will be providing a $100 stipend, funded by the Federal CARES program, to employees who receive their COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nSuperintendent Steve Darnell informed staff via email that beginning Monday, vaccinations will be offered to all K-12 educational personnel. As an incentive, the district will utilize federal CARES funding to grant a $100 stipend to all employees who get vaccinated.\n\nThe email instructed, \"Once you have completed the full vaccination process (either one shot or two, depending on the vaccine brand), kindly submit a copy of your CDC vaccination card displaying your fully vaccinated status, along with a completed claim voucher to Vicki Camden. The stipend will be processed as additional pay in the subsequent payroll cycle.\"\n\nEmployees who schedule vaccinations during work hours are required to utilize sick or personal leave time. In case an employee experiences vaccine side effects, any additional time needed would be considered an acceptable COVID-19 leave request covered by federal Department of Labor regulations, according to the email.\n\nSuperintendent Darnell mentioned that the district is collaborating with Meijer to organize onsite vaccination clinics at Pierceton Elementary and Whitko Jr-Sr High School. Further details will be shared once they are confirmed.\n\n\"I urge you to take advantage of the $100 stipend for getting vaccinated.

Some animals remain for just a few hours until their owners are found, while others may stay for several weeks. If the owners cannot be identified, the animals are advertised for ten days before being auctioned off.\n\n\u201cA cow or horse on the roadway after dark poses a significant risk to public safety.

        "A file photo from November 20, 2017, shows the logos of the U.S. multinational technology company Google displayed on computer screens.   \nPhoto by LOIC VENANCE / AFP\n\nTech giants have transformed our daily lives, yet governments worldwide are increasingly concerned about their growing influence. Known collectively as GAFAM\u2014Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft\u2014these companies face accusations of tax evasion, unfair competition, media content theft, and the spread of fake news.\n\nAs the European Union prepares to unveil measures to regulate these companies on December 15, here is a global overview of ongoing regulatory efforts:\n\n**Taxation**\n\nThe 27-member EU has yet to reach a consensus on taxing digital giants, but individual member states are taking action. France and Italy have implemented a three percent tax on their turnover, Austria has imposed a five percent tax on advertising revenues, and Spain has introduced a three percent charge on specific activities. Outside the EU, the United Kingdom has instituted a two percent tax on certain digital services. Beyond Europe, India imposed a tax on online advertising in 2016, while Australia applied a 10 percent VAT on digital services such as streaming, downloading games and apps, e-books, and data storage. These measures have angered the United States, home to these tech giants, which has threatened reciprocal tariffs. Meanwhile, negotiations for a global tax on multinationals, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, stalled in October.\n\n**Competition**\n\nDigital giants are frequently criticized for their market dominance and sidelining of competitors. Between 2017 and 2019, the EU fined Google 8.25 billion euros ($10 billion) for market dominance via its Android system, a decision Google is contesting in court. In 2013, the EU fined Microsoft 561 million euros for forcing users of Windows 7 to use its Internet Explorer search engine. Amazon and Apple are also under investigation for potential breaches of EU competition laws. In the U.S., federal and state antitrust authorities filed lawsuits against Facebook on December 9, challenging its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Additionally, in October, the Justice Department and 11 states initiated proceedings against Google for allegedly strengthening its monopoly on online searches and advertising illegally.\n\n**Personal Data**\n\nTech giants frequently face criticism over their collection and use of personal data.",

        "At the Siri Fort Indoor Stadium on Saturday, Belarus' Vanesa Kaladzinskaya overcame Nigeria's Odunayo Folasade to guide UP Dangal to their second successive victory in the Pro Wrestling League. The bout began with Vanesa starting slowly, allowing Odunayo of Mumbai Maharathi to gain the early advantage. However, as the contest progressed, Vanesa found her rhythm and ultimately triumphed 7-5 in the 57 kg competition. At one stage, she was on the brink of defeat but held her nerve to secure an unassailable 4-2 lead for her team in the tie.\n\nThe turning point for UP Dangal came from Asian Champion Abdurakhmonov Bekzod, who played a crucial role in setting up the victory after the two teams were tied 2-2. Bekzod scripted a decisive victory over India's Veer Dev in the 74 kg event, putting UP in the driver's seat after the fifth bout. The Uzbek wrestler dominated his opponent, injuring him smartly and completing a 12-0 rout with over three minutes left in the bout.\n\nEarlier in the match, UP Dangal's Nitin, the hero of the last tie, continued his impressive run with a stunning upset. He defeated World Championship bronze medalist Yatsenko Andrey 4-3 in the 57 kg competition, earning his team's first point. Nitin gained an early lead with a solitary point, but the Azerbaijan wrestler bounced back, winning four points to shift the momentum. In a dramatic finish, Nitin clinched a three-pointer in the dying seconds to secure the win.\n\nUP's skipper, Vinesh Phogat, further solidified their lead with a commanding 10-0 victory in the 50 kg women's event against compatriot Seema. The 2017 Commonwealth Wrestling Champion showcased her ruthlessness on the mat, never allowing her opponent any chance, and helped UP seize the early initiative.\n\nHowever, the Maharathis fought back into the contest with 2014 Commonwealth Games' silver medalist Satyawart Kadian defeating UP's Vicky 10-2 in the 92 kg contest. Satyawart, who had a disappointing start to his campaign, bounced back in style, dominating the six-minute bout to keep his side in the competition.\n\nIn the inconsequential seventh bout, Rio Olympic gold medalist Soslan Romonov beat Bajrang Punia to register his side's third point, although Maharathis still lost 3-4 on the night. Earlier, the Maharathis had won the toss and opted to block heavyweight wrestler Jamaladdin Magomedov of Azerbaijan, while the Dangals decided to keep Frenchwoman Cynthia Vescon out.",

This marked the 15th consecutive month of export growth and set a new volume record for a single month.\n\nThe ministry attributed this success to several factors: \"The strengthening global economic recovery, robust demand for mobile devices and consumer electronics, and rising international raw material prices all contributed to December's record-breaking performance.\"\n\nKey highlights from the December report:\n- Exports to China increased 16.8%, matching November's growth\n- U.S.-bound shipments grew 12.4%, following November's 14.6% expansion\n- Strong demand persisted for integrated circuits and machinery\n- International crude oil and basic metal prices showed continued strength\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThe export sector grew 13.2% overall in 2017, positioning Taiwan's economy favorably for 2018, though a strengthening Taiwan dollar and rising global interest rates could impact momentum.\n\nKevin Wang, an analyst at Taishin investment advisory company, notes: \"While we expect January exports to maintain single-digit growth, first-quarter export growth may slightly lag behind fourth-quarter performance.\" Wang credits December's exceptional results to increased demand for integrated circuits driven by artificial intelligence, bitcoin mining, and mobile phone products.",

        "The liquor vends in the district have been closed since the curfew was imposed on March 23. With the Punjab government ordering the opening of liquor vends in the state from Thursday, Ludhiana liquor vend owners have marked circles outside their shops to maintain social distancing. According to the state government's orders, only five customers will be allowed outside the shops at a time. There is also a provision to deliver liquor to the doorsteps of residents, with a maximum of two litres of liquor per customer. A curfew pass has been made mandatory for the staff of vends delivering alcohol to doorsteps, while delivery of liquor has been prohibited in containment zones.\n\nLearning from other states, the district police have geared up to handle any potential chaotic situation outside liquor vends. Commissioner of Police Rakesh Agrawal stated that the police were prepared to tackle any such situation and were committed to executing the government's orders.\n\nMeanwhile, the move has received a mixed response from the public. Kulwant Singh of Sarabha Nagar mentioned that due to the substantial monetary losses the government had suffered during the lockdown, it was compelled to open liquor vends to generate revenue.

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# Nigeria's Economic Downturn: Oil Sector Struggles Amid Global Crisis\n\nNigeria's oil and gas sector experienced a significant decline in its economic contribution during the second quarter of 2020, driven by plummeting oil prices and diminished global demand. This downturn marked the first economic contraction in over three years, with the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) falling by 6.10%, a stark contrast to the 1.87% growth recorded in the previous quarter.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the oil sector's performance deteriorated dramatically:\n\n- Q1 2020: 5.06% growth\n- Q2 2020: 6.63% year-on-year decline\n- Overall decrease: 13.80% compared to Q2 2019\n\nThe sector's contribution to total real GDP also diminished:\n- Q2 2020: 8.93%\n- Q1 2020: 9.50%\n- Q2 2019: 8.98%\n\n## Production Challenges\n\nDaily oil production faced significant constraints:\n- Q2 2020: 1.81 million barrels per day\n- Q1 2020: 2.07 million barrels per day\n- Q2 2019: 2.02 million barrels per day\n\nThe OPEC+ agreement in April 2020 implemented unprecedented production cuts of 9.7 million barrels per day for May and June, later extended through July. Despite Nigeria's assigned cap of 1.41 million barrels per day, the country exceeded its quota during this period.\n\n## Economic Impact\n\nThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) attributed the production decline to:\n- OPEC+ production cut agreement\n- Accumulated unsold crude inventory\n- Weakening oil prices (Q2 2020: $33/barrel vs Q1 2020: $51/barrel)\n\nThe situation improved marginally as Brent crude prices recovered from April's low of $16 per barrel to $45.91 by Tuesday evening (Nigeria time).\n\n## Broader Economic Context\n\nBudget Office Director-General Ben Akabueze highlighted the severity of the situation:\n- Oil revenues declined by nearly 90%\n- Oil and gas sector represents:\n  - 10% of Nigeria's GDP\n  - 50% of government revenues\n  - 90% of export earnings\n\n## Power Sector Performance\n\nThe electricity sector also experienced significant challenges:\n- Q2 2020: 8.64% year-on-year growth (down from 29.75% in Q2 2019)\n- Nominal GDP contribution increased to 0.92% (up from 0.82% in Q2 2019)\n- Real terms showed a 3.00% decline, compared to 0.43% growth in Q2 2019\n\nThis revised version maintains the original information while improving readability through better organization, clearer structure, and enhanced formatting.",
        "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014  After nearly two weeks of massive protests and political turmoil ignited by leaked crude and insulting chat messages between him and his top advisers, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 announced his resignation late Wednesday, effective Aug. 2.\n\nThe 40-year-old son of a former governor, Rossell\u00f3 becomes the first chief executive to resign in the modern history of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of more than 3 million American citizens.  Justice Secretary Wanda V\u00e1zquez will assume the post less than halfway through Rossell\u00f3\u2019s four-year term, becoming Puerto Rico\u2019s second female governor.\n\nRossell\u00f3\u2019s announcement, delivered on Facebook just before midnight, sparked an eruption of cheers and singing from the thousands gathered outside the governor\u2019s mansion in Old San Juan.  In a video address, a shaken-looking Rossell\u00f3 listed his accomplishments before confirming his resignation.  \u201cMy only priority has been the transformation of our island and the well-being of our people,\u201d he said. Acknowledging the protests, he added, \u201cThe demands have been overwhelming and I\u2019ve received them with the highest degree of humility.\u201d\n\nRossell\u00f3\u2019s announcement came after a bizarre, hours-long standoff.  Having pledged to deliver a message to the people of Puerto Rico, the governor remained inexplicably silent for hours as thousands of protesters chanted for his resignation.  An announcement initially expected at 5 p.m. finally arrived less than a half-hour before midnight. \u201cDespite expecting to serve the term that the people democratically elected me to, today I feel that continuing in this position represents a threat to the success we have achieved,\u201d Rossell\u00f3 said.\n\nPuerto Rico Rep. Gabriel Rodr\u00edguez, a member of Rossell\u00f3\u2019s pro-statehood party, told The Associated Press that legislators initially agreed to suspend impeachment proceedings and give the governor until 5 p.m. to announce his resignation.",

        "**Columbia Generating Station Achieves Record-Breaking Nuclear Energy Production in 2018**\n\nRICHLAND, Wash., Jan. 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Columbia Generating Station, the third-largest electricity generator in Washington State, achieved a historic milestone in 2018, producing more clean nuclear energy than any other year in its 34-year operating history.  Surpassing the previous record set in 2016, Columbia delivered over 9.7 million megawatt-hours of electricity to the Northwest power grid.  This marks the fifth new generation record in the last seven years.\n\nThis consistent increase in output since 2011 stems from ongoing maintenance and upgrades, which have added approximately 60 megawatts to Columbia\u2019s capacity, bringing its current output to 1,207 megawatts (gross). This is enough clean energy to power Seattle and a portion of its metropolitan area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about mitigating climate change one clean megawatt at a time, while providing reliable, low-cost electricity 24/7 throughout the Northwest,\u201d said Energy Northwest CEO Brad Sawatzke.  \u201cOur team\u2019s outstanding work in enhancing nuclear performance continues to lower electricity costs for consumers.\u201d\n\nEnergy Northwest projects an average cost of power for Columbia of 4.2 cents per kilowatt-hour during its 2018-2019 fuel cycle, a significant decrease from 6.3 cents (adjusted for inflation) during the 2010-2011 cycle.  Columbia refuels every two years, leading to higher costs during refueling years and lower costs during full-run years. Therefore, generation costs are measured in two-year averages, as shown below:\n\n**Columbia Generation Station Cost of Power (2010-2019)**\n\n| Fuel Cycle (fiscal years) | Cost Per Kilowatt-Hour |\n|---|---|\n| FY10-11 | 6.30\u00a2 |\n| FY12-13 | 5.75\u00a2 |\n| FY14-15 | 5.10\u00a2 |\n| FY16-17 | 4.70\u00a2 |\n| FY18-19 (Estimate) | 4.20\u00a2 |\n\nThis cost-effectiveness compares favorably to 2018 EIA estimates for new generation resources potentially entering service by 2022: 4.8 cents for advanced combined-cycle natural gas, 4.7 cents for solar (including a 1.3 cent taxpayer subsidy), and 3.7 cents for onshore wind (including a 1.1 cent taxpayer subsidy).\n\nWashington State enjoys the lowest retail electricity costs in the United States, averaging 7.25 cents per kilowatt-hour over the past five years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nSince 2012, Columbia has maintained an average capacity factor of 92 percent, significantly exceeding national averages for other energy sources.",
        "Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe is suing the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), alleging they refused to provide him with documents related to his firing. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe on March 16, just two days before he was set to retire, on the recommendation of FBI and DOJ officials. McCabe, who joined the FBI in 1996 and was named to the No. 2 position 20 years later, became the bureau's acting leader following the firing in May 2017 of James Comey as director.\n\nThe case pits the career law enforcement official against a Justice Department that employed him for more than two decades. It refocuses attention on a firing last March that divided current and former DOJ officials and signals that McCabe, repeatedly targeted for criticism and attacks by President Trump, is determined to clear his name in court. McCabe faces a possible criminal probe into whether he intentionally misled internal investigators. The inspector general's office concluded in a report earlier this year that McCabe had repeatedly deceived investigators and referred the matter for potential criminal prosecution to the U.S. attorney's office in Washington. McCabe has denied the allegations, stating that he tried to correct the record when he thought his answers were being misunderstood during interviews with investigators.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, McCabe's lawyers assert that the DOJ has publicly defended the firing yet failed to identify for McCabe the policies and procedures it followed before dismissing him. The department has allegedly withheld the information for fear that the materials could be used against them in additional lawsuits. \"We don't create or adjudicate under secret law or procedure,\" David Snyder, one of McCabe's lawyers, said in an email to The Associated Press. The complaint quotes a May 21 email from one DOJ official stating, \"In the absence of actual litigation, (Plaintiff's) demands are not constrained by the normal rules of discovery, which exist, in part, to protect defendants from burdensome or otherwise unreasonable requests.\"\n\nAmong the records being sought are an inspector general manual that outlines the guidelines governing the office and FBI policy guides on handling disciplinary matters. The lawsuit claims that the inspector general's office refused to make the manual available for public review and denied multiple requests to provide it, also denying the lawyers access to a library or reading room where the materials could have been reviewed. The complaint also alleges that the FBI and DOJ failed to disclose a series of requested FBI documents, preventing McCabe and his lawyers from knowing whether appropriate procedures were followed before the firing.\n\nMcCabe's lawyers emphasize that they seek the records to vindicate his rights and restore his good name, as they weigh whether to take more legal action over what they contend was an improper firing. The case names as defendants the Justice Department, the FBI, and the inspector general's office. In a May 3 email to the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, Snyder requested records about the FBI's \"Offense Codes,\" media relations policy, and any other manuals about internal investigations and discipline that might relate to McCabe's firing, but the FBI and DOJ lawyers turned down the request.\n\nA spokeswoman for the DOJ declined to comment, and a spokesman for the watchdog office did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The lawsuit also comes just days ahead of a Justice Department inspector general report expected to criticize senior FBI officials, including McCabe, for their actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation. McCabe's lawyers express their intent to continue pursuing legal avenues to address what they view as an unjust dismissal.",
        "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Seven Hong Kong pro-democracy activists pleaded guilty Thursday to organizing and inciting others to take part in an unauthorized assembly held in 2019, local media reported. The activists appearing in court included Raphael Wong, the former chairman of the League of Social Democrats political party, and Figo Chan, who led the Civil Human Rights Front, a now-disbanded group that organized protests.\n\n\"I was protesting based on the principle of civil disobedience. One of the key elements of civil disobedience is to accept the charges. So that is what we are going to do later, to plead guilty,\" Wong said Thursday ahead of the proceedings. He added, \"Another key element is that the people carrying out civil disobedience actions know being jailed is just part of the process. We are not worried about being jailed. Instead, we hope we can achieve democracy after this process.\"\n\nThe activists are the latest to appear in court for charges related to the 2019 anti-government protests that roiled the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The protests were sparked by concerns that Beijing was infringing on the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it was handed to Chinese control in 1997. Beijing responded to the protests by imposing a strict new national security law last year that has effectively criminalized much of the opposition to the government and silenced dissent.\n\nMost of the city\u2019s most prominent activists, including Joshua Wong and Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai, are currently behind bars. Many of them were prosecuted for taking part in unauthorized protests in 2019. Of the seven defendants on Thursday, only Raphael Wong was not held in custody prior to appearing in court. The other six are currently behind bars after being convicted of other offenses related to their activism.\n\nLocal news outlets Ming Pao and Stand News later reported all seven pleaded guilty.",

        "If you spend hours working at your desk or playing games, you need a supportive chair to prevent back and neck pain. Incorrect posture can lead to poor circulation and unnecessary fatigue, affecting your mood and contributing to stress. The right gaming chair can help alleviate these issues.\n\nThere are a few things to look out for when selecting a gaming chair for back pain. Everyone\u2019s needs are different, so it\u2019s important to choose a chair with features that best suit you. Chairs that feature an adjustable back with lumbar and neck support are especially desirable due to their high level of adjustability. Some gaming chairs have ergonomic shapes that encourage you to sit up straight instead of slouching. A gaming chair that eases back pain should also have firm but ample padding. A tall backrest can also reduce slouching because they provide extra neck support that\u2019s not found on shorter office chairs. Other features to look out for if you want to prevent back pain are a reclining function and removable pillows. Being able to recline allows your body to stretch and find the perfect position to get you the support you need. Included pillows can provide additional neck and lumbar support.\n\nMoving from a conventional office chair to a gaming chair might be a bit difficult at first because your body has to get used to the new seating position. It shouldn\u2019t take long to adjust to the new position, and you\u2019ll likely know if the chair is right for your back within a week.\n\nHere are some of the best gaming chairs for back pain:\n\nVertagear SL5000\nThe Vertagear SL5000 is a racing-style seat favored by gamers for its immense comfort. The high backrest provides excellent support, and it also has a dual-vent system to keep you cool. Both the seat and backrest also have side supports to keep you snug in your seat. This Vertagear chair is upholstered with polyurethane (PU) leather that\u2019s easy to clean. The SL5000 gives users easily adjustable comfort features, including removable memory foam pillows that provide neck and lumbar support. Another feature that can help to ease back pain is the adjustable backrest, which can recline between 80 and 140 degrees. This chair also has the usual features associated with gaming chairs, like adjustable height, four-direction armrests, and a tilt and locking mechanism. The Vertagear can help relieve back pain with its additional padding and adjustability features.",

        "Nearly a year ago, counties across Western North Carolina (WNC) received almost $10 million in state grant funding to improve rural broadband connectivity. This funding has become even more critical due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced a shift to at-home distance learning and encouraged businesses to allow employees to work remotely.\n\nIn May 2019, North Carolina launched the Growing Rural Economies with Access to Technology (GREAT) grant. According to Governor Roy Cooper and the NC Department of Information Technology, these matching grants targeted \"Internet service providers and electric membership cooperatives that compete for funding to lower financial barriers that prevent high-speed internet service expansion in Tier 1 \u2013 economically distressed counties.\"  The program, initiated by the N.C. General Assembly in 2018, subsidizes internet providers and electric cooperatives partnering with unserved and underserved rural communities statewide.\n\n\u201cAccess to reliable, high-speed internet service is critical for businesses to grow, students to learn, and communities to thrive,\u201d Governor Cooper stated when announcing the funding. \u201cThese grants will help connect thousands of homes and businesses with opportunities across the state and around the world.\u201d\n\nThe grants aided 14 companies, including Morris Broadband, which serves Macon County. These funds will improve broadband access for approximately 10,000 households and nearly 600 businesses and community institutions.\n\nIn Macon County, the Morris Broadband expansion aims to provide internet access to 226 homes in various outlying areas, including Gibson Cove Road, Granny Kate Lane, Stoudemire Drive, Schurman Cove Road, Annes Lane, Gibson Cove Estates Road, Willow Wind Heights, Willowbrook Estates, Bryson City Road, Iotla Church Road, Quail Hollow Road, Riverbend Road, Liner Drive, Iotla Hill Drive, Olsen Drive, Bennett Road, Sanderstown Road, Rain Ridge Road, Red Fox Lane, Buster Cabe Road, Tranquil Road, Holbrooks Road, Piney Grove Road, Lee Bates Road, Kangas Drive, Country Walk, Circle Trace, Dillon Drive, Main Trace, Center Trace, East Trace, Southern Trace, Dowdle Mountain Road, Wells Grove Road, Jennings Drive, Angel Cove Road, Chapel Cove Circle, Brookshire Lane, Oakridge Drive, and Hunters Trail. This project is estimated at $667,000, comprising $433,550 in state grant money and a $233,450 investment from Morris.  Currently, Morris Broadband provides internet services to just under 3,500 residences in Macon County.\n\n\u201cThe construction process began in the last quarter of 2019,\u201d explained Morris Broadband General Manager Tony Carter. \u201cThis involved engineering design, pole permits and replacements, and other make-ready preparations.  These have all been filed, and we are just awaiting a few more responses and replacements before we can begin construction.\u201d\n\nCarter stated that the company is now shifting its focus to the physical construction of the expansion project, anticipating a start date sometime in April.",
        "The upcoming super-middleweight title clash between Chris Eubank Jr. and George Groves promises to be a 2018 highlight, a potential 12-round classic.  Beyond the excitement of Eubank Jr.\u2019s inherited self-belief and blinding hand speed, this fight represents a pivotal moment in the younger Eubank\u2019s career.  As Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great man of letters, wrote nearly 300 years ago: \u201cThere must always be a struggle between father and son, while one aims at power and the other at independence.\u201d This struggle is embodied in the Eubanks.\n\nChris Eubank Sr., a former illustrious double world champion, has been a constant, arguably overbearing, presence in his son\u2019s career.  Much like a Svengali, he has dominated and monitored almost every move his son has made, both inside and outside the ring.  This fight offers Eubank Jr., at 28, the chance to step out of his father's shadow and forge his own identity. He acknowledges this, stating his desire to be recognized as Chris Eubank, not simply Chris Eubank Jr.  A victory over Groves would be a significant step in that direction.\n\nWhile Eubank Jr. enters the fight as a surprising favorite, endorsed by a 20-10 margin in a Boxing Monthly poll of British professionals, Groves, the reigning WBA super-middleweight champion, presents a formidable challenge.  Groves, making his third title defense, will need his sharp jab and honed defensive skills to weather the early-round onslaught expected from Eubank Jr.  Although Eubank Jr. boasts impressive speed and confidence, his opponents, with the exception of Billy Joe Saunders (who defeated him on points), haven't been of the same caliber as those Groves has faced.\n\nI question Eubank Jr.'s power at this weight.  He might have been better suited staying at middleweight. I doubt he possesses the power to seriously trouble the top super-middleweights.  While Groves has suffered two losses to Carl Froch, including a brutal knockout in their second bout, his size advantage in this fight could be decisive.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, I believe Groves\u2019s counter-punching and precise timing will carry him to a close but clear points victory.  His size and experience against top-tier competition will ultimately prove too much for Eubank Jr. to overcome.  This fight isn't just about a title; it's about a son's fight for independence and recognition in his own right.",

Following their discussions, Dangote, who has business interests across Africa including Tanzania, urged other businessmen to invest in the country, citing the conducive environment.\n\n\"The business landscape has transformed significantly, with opportunities emerging. Wherever I go, I will promote Tanzania as an investment destination and encourage others to consider investing here,\" Dangote stated.\n\nWith investments in Tanzania totaling $770 million USD (1.761 trillion shillings), primarily in cement manufacturing, Dangote expressed plans to establish a fertilizer factory in the country. He emphasized his commitment to further investments in Tanzania to foster job creation and economic growth.\n\nPresident Samia commended Dangote for his contributions to the country and assured him of the government's support and protection for his investments. She directed key officials, including Minister of Trade and Investment Prof. Kitila Mkumbo, Minister of Investment Geoffrey Mwambe, and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Hamad Masauni, to address any challenges facing Dangote's industry to ensure its continued production and success.",

        "Chargers\u2019 preseason opener, a 48-17 loss to the Seattle Seahawks Sunday night, was marred by a potentially serious injury to starting middle linebacker Denzel Perryman.  Perryman hurt his left ankle in the first quarter and was later seen on crutches and in a walking boot. He underwent an MRI on Monday, but the team has yet to release a medical update.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure how bad it is right now, we\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d coach Anthony Lynn said after the game. \u201cIt could be serious, but I have no idea right now.\u201d This injury comes on the heels of two other significant blows to the Chargers. Projected starting right guard Forrest Lamp, a second-round pick from Western Kentucky, tore his ACL in the first week of training camp and is out for the season.  First-round pick Mike Williams, a wide receiver from Clemson, is also sidelined with a herniated disk in his lower back suffered in May.  There is no timetable for his return.\n\nPerryman, a 24-year-old second-round pick from Miami in 2015, recorded 80 tackles, two sacks and an interception in 12 games last season, starting 11. He missed four games due to hamstring and knee injuries. As a rookie in 2015, he tallied 95 tackles and two sacks in 14 games.  If Perryman\u2019s injury is significant, it will likely elevate reserve middle linebacker Korey Toomer into the starting lineup.  Toomer, who had four tackles Sunday night, played in 13 games with eight starts last season, recording 69 tackles and one sack.\n\nDespite the loss and the injury, there were some bright spots for the Chargers. The first-team offense orchestrated an impressive game-opening, 13-play, 75-yard touchdown drive.  Quarterback Philip Rivers completed five of six passes for 56 yards and emerged without a speck of dirt on his uniform. \u201cWe kept Philip clean,\u201d left guard Matt Slauson said. \u201cHe was getting the ball out fast. We ran the ball well. Everything was rolling. Communication was fast and clean. Nobody was really unsure.\u201d The strong play of the revamped offensive line, which will feature at least three new starters, is crucial to the Chargers\u2019 success given the talent at the skill positions with Rivers, running back Melvin Gordon, and a deep group of receivers and tight ends.\n\nThe drive included a 17-yard completion to tight end Hunter Henry, a 15-yard catch by Travis Benjamin on third-and-nine, and a 14-yard screen pass to Branden Oliver.  The drive culminated in a five-yard touchdown pass to veteran tight end Antonio Gates. \u201cWhen you have a guy like Philip, a guy who understands the system, understands the game, he puts you in the best position possible,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he was able to do. We were so efficient. Our whole thing is trying to be balanced, and we were able to do that.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers' first-team defense also performed well initially, preventing Seattle from scoring on its first two possessions.  Cornerback Casey Hayward provided tight coverage, and defensive end Melvin Ingram stopped quarterback Trevone Boykin for no gain.  However, the second- and third-team units struggled against Seattle\u2019s reserves. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a good team, but it\u2019s not just about the ones,\u201d safety Tre Boston said. \u201cUnfortunately in football, your ones will go down every so often, and we need twos and threes who are going to pick up the slack and help us.\u201d\n\nBackup quarterback candidate Cardale Jones, recently acquired from Buffalo, displayed flashes of potential, including a 38-yard completion to tight end Matt Weiser and a 13-yard scramble.  However, he completed only two of nine passes for 50 yards and took an 11-yard sack.  \u201cHe\u2019s still learning our system,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cWe threw him in the fire, and he did some good things, but he also did some bad things, things he needs to improve on \u2014 his accuracy, some reads, some protections.\u201d\n\n\n**(Remove all extraneous captions and irrelevant material about McGregor, Mayweather, and the Rams.)**",
        "The latest Real Estate Institute data revealed that New Zealand house prices had reached a new annual record, increasing by 8.2 percent from a median of $561,500 to $607,500. This marked the first time that house prices in the country surpassed $600,000. In Auckland, house prices saw a rise of $7,000 annually, climbing from $861,000 to $868,000, which was the highest median price for the city in 19 months, according to REINZ.\n\nSix regions witnessed the fastest annual price growth, setting new records in the process. These included Manawatu/Whanganui, Hawke's Bay, Otago, Waikato, Northland, and Bay of Plenty, with percentage increases ranging from 7.8 to 20.9 percent.\n\nREINZ chief executive Bindi Norwell highlighted the strong performance in median prices during October, emphasizing that it was the highest number of regional record prices seen in the country in 23 months. Auckland also experienced a significant increase, with the median price in Auckland City reaching $1,001,000, a 4.6 percent annual rise.\n\nDespite the positive price trends, both Auckland and national sales volumes experienced declines in October. The number of properties sold fell by 4 percent nationally and 5.5 percent in Auckland. Norwell attributed this decrease to fewer listings compared to the previous year and the impact of the foreign buyer ban introduced in October 2018.\n\nIn terms of property sales, auctions accounted for 15.5 percent of national sales in October, with a total of 1052 properties sold through this method. The national inventory of properties available for sale dropped by 13.1 percent to 22,313. The REINZ House Price Index also reached a new record high, rising by 3.9 percent year-on-year to 2863.\n\nCoreLogic reported that the housing market showed signs of strengthening nationally in October, with all main urban areas experiencing property value increases. The CoreLogic QV House Price Index indicated that average property values rose by 0.4 percent nationwide last month.

        "Matt Park, Diana Oh, Ryan McCurdy, and Rocky Vega in \"{my lingerie play}\" at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater. (Photo by Jeremy Daniel)\n\nOnly three months after the late activist Edith Windsor's 2013 victory for gay rights at the Supreme Court, which led to the national legalization of same-sex marriage, The New York Times ran an article questioning the resolve of queer theatres to evolve with the times.\n\n\"At a time of rapid change in the gay rights movement, from marriage to the military, the purpose of a strictly gay theatre company isn't the same as it was 10 years ago,\" remarked Times contributor Erik Piepenburg. The writer observed a general decline in interest in LGBTQ topics and a subsequent drop in revenues and taste at gay-specific companies. The logical result? Queer theatre companies were opting for lighter, campier fare, Piepenburg wrote, to keep their audiences happy.\n\nUnderlying this high-profile conclusion is the anxiety that queer theatre cannot survive the shifting tides of public opinion. Without antipathy, is there just apathy? Without something to fight against, does the once edgy avant-garde of queer theatre disappear?\n\nElsewhere, critics have eviscerated a handful of once-classic gay works as shallow, dated excursions. Reflecting on the autumn 2016 season, The New Yorker's Hilton Als wrote a particularly brutal assessment of William Finn and James Lapine's Broadway revival of Falsettos.",

        "## African Football Stars Shine in UEFA Competitions\n\nThe UEFA Champions League and Europa League group stages kick off this week, with a strong African contingent ready to make their mark.  This is a perfect opportunity to revisit the continent's top performers in these prestigious tournaments, exploring their impressive records and achievements.\n\n**Most Appearances in UEFA Club Football**\n\n* **113 \u2013 Samuel Eto'o (Cameroon)**\n\nTeams: Real Madrid, Mallorca, Barcelona, Internazionale, Anji Makhachkala, Chelsea, Everton\n\nEto'o holds the record for most UEFA club competition appearances by an African player.  Ironically, despite his strong association with Barcelona, he debuted for Real Madrid and later represented Mallorca in the Champions League.  The prolific striker lifted the coveted trophy twice with Barcelona and once with Inter Milan, among numerous other accolades in his illustrious career. While currently playing in Turkey with Antalyaspor, he could potentially add to his impressive tally.\n\n* **111 \u2013 Seydou Keita (Mali)**\n\nTeams: Marseille, Lens, Sevilla, Barcelona, Valencia, Roma\n\nThough recently playing in the Asian Champions League with El-Jaish (Qatar), Keita is best known for his two Champions League triumphs with Barcelona.  He also won the UEFA Super Cup with both Sevilla and Barcelona, representing a total of six teams in UEFA club competitions. The dynamic midfielder contributed significantly with crucial goals throughout his European career.\n\n* **102 \u2013 Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast)**\n\nTeams: Marseille, Chelsea, Galatasaray\n\nAt 39, Drogba continues to play for Phoenix Rising in the USA, but adding to his UEFA club competition appearances is highly unlikely.  He achieved significant success with Chelsea over nine seasons (in two spells), including a crucial role in their 2011/12 Champions League victory. He also represented Marseille and Galatasaray in European competitions.\n\n* **90 \u2013 Sammy Kuffour (Ghana)**\n\nTeams: Bayern Munich, Roma, Livorno\n\nKuffour is renowned for his 12-year tenure at Bayern Munich, where he won the Champions League in 2000/01 after a heartbreaking runner-up finish against Manchester United two years prior.  A popular figure at Bayern, he also won six Bundesliga titles before joining Roma in 2005. He later had a loan spell at Livorno, representing them in the now-defunct UEFA Cup during the 2006/07 season.\n\n* **90 \u2013 Kolo Tour\u00e9 (Ivory Coast)**\n\nTeams: Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Celtic\n\nTour\u00e9's 90th and final UEFA club appearance came last season in Celtic's 2-0 loss to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach.  He retired shortly after featuring in Liverpool's 3-1 Europa League final defeat to Sevilla, ending his career without a European club title.  He also played for Arsenal in their 2005/06 Champions League final loss to Barcelona.  His brother, Yaya Tour\u00e9 (Manchester City), trails him by just four appearances on the all-time African list.\n\n\n**Most Goals in UEFA Club Football**\n\n* **50 \u2013 Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast)**\n\nTeams: Marseille, Chelsea, Galatasaray\n\nDrogba is the only African player to reach the 50-goal mark in UEFA club competitions, averaging nearly a goal every other game.  Most of these goals came during his time at Chelsea, though he also scored five for Marseille and three for Galatasaray.  His equalizer against Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final, paving the way for Chelsea's penalty shootout victory, remains a career highlight.\n\n\n* **48 \u2013 Samuel Eto'o (Cameroon)**\n\nTeams: Real Madrid, Mallorca, Barcelona, Internazionale, Anji Makhachkala, Chelsea, Everton\n\nEto'o will be aiming to surpass Drogba's record, though he first needs to help Antalyaspor qualify for UEFA club competitions. His first European goal came for Mallorca against Hajduk Split in 2001, and his last for Everton against FK Krasnodar in the 2014 Europa League.\n\n* **35 \u2013 George Weah (Liberia)**\n\nTeams: Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan\n\nConsidered one of the greatest African footballers of recent decades, Weah was a prolific goalscorer for every club he represented. While he never lifted a European club trophy, he enjoyed considerable domestic success with Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, and AC Milan, consistently scoring for each in continental competitions.  He later played for Chelsea, Manchester City, and Marseille.\n\n\n* **32 \u2013 Benni McCarthy (South Africa)**\n\nTeams: Ajax, Celta Vigo, FC Porto, Blackburn Rovers\n\nMcCarthy played a key role in FC Porto's unexpected Champions League triumph under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2004. His memorable brace against Manchester United in the second round secured a 3-2 aggregate victory. He also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup with Celta Vigo and featured in European competitions for Ajax and Blackburn Rovers.\n\n* **31 \u2013 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 (Mali)**\n\nTeams: Lyon, Sevilla\n\nWhile he started his career at Lyon, Kanout\u00e9's European exploits are primarily associated with Sevilla. He helped the club secure two UEFA Cup titles (2006 and 2007), scoring in both finals.  His six goals in the 2006 competition placed him just one behind the top scorer, Mat\u00edas Delgado. Born in France, Kanout\u00e9 represented Mali internationally, scoring 23 goals in 35 appearances.\n\n**Other Notable Facts**\n\n* **Waiting to Break Their Duck:** Botswana, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mauritania, Seychelles, Sudan, and South Sudan are the only African nations yet to have a player feature in UEFA club competitions.\n\n* **Super Seven:** Samuel Eto'o holds the record for representing the most clubs (seven) in UEFA competitions by an African player.",
        "Our faith in the social sciences diminishes daily, yet it's heartening to find scholars who retain their reason. While many sociologists readily embraced woke ideology (if not actively pioneered it), a University of Illinois professor cautions that the current trend of labeling everything and everyone \"racist\" is counterproductive.\n\nIn a *Persuasion* article, Professor Ilana Redstone argues that overusing the term to denounce anything violating one's political philosophy has rendered it meaningless.  \"The charge of racism can be reputation-destroying and have long-term psychological effects,\" Redstone writes. \"Yet its excessive application dilutes that power\u2014for example, applying the word \u2018racist\u2019 to both Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who murdered nine Black worshippers at a South Carolina church in 2015, and a Seattle local-business promotion involving decorative monkeys.  The antiracist strategy is not only weakening its own best weapon, it\u2019s backfiring.\u201d\n\nRedstone explains that supporting racial equality doesn't necessitate subscribing to woke \"antiracist\" dogma. \"The argument of antiracist activists is that, if you stand against their methods, you oppose their ends, regardless of your insistence otherwise. Unsurprisingly, this has narrowed the spectrum of acceptable views on sensitive topics,\" she writes.  For instance, opposition to affirmative action and support for stricter border controls are now frequently labeled racist. While racial hostility *could* motivate these positions\u2014affirmative action benefits underrepresented minorities, and 21st-century Western immigration largely involves non-white migrants\u2014other factors are possible.\n\n\"One might have non-racist motives for such views,\" Redstone continues, \"including concerns about the efficacy of affirmative action. Supporting immigration restrictions could stem from economic anxieties.  Even if you disagree with these positions, labeling their advocates with such a loaded term is not only unjust but counterproductive.\"\n\nThe core problem is the stifling of dialogue.  A functioning society, indeed Western civilization itself, relies on the free exchange and refinement of ideas. This becomes impossible when a vocal minority of woke leftists weaponizes the term \"racist\" against dissenting opinions.",
        "Donald Trump Accuses Democrats of 'Rooting Against' United States in North Korea Negotiations\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump responded on Friday to criticism from Democrats regarding his decision to cancel the meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump claimed that Democrats are clearly hoping for our negotiations with North Korea to fail. He likened their stance to defending MS-13 gang members by insisting they are individuals who should be supported and questioning the benefits of the tax cuts in favor of raising taxes instead. According to Trump, the Democrats have lost touch with reality.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi labeled Kim Jong-un as the main beneficiary of the canceled meeting, referring to Trump's letter as overly friendly and cozy.\n\nTo show your support for True Pundit's independent voice, consider making a contribution today!

Their most recent match added a tie to their otherwise perfect record after facing the Central Alberta Selects on November 1 at the NexSource Centre.\n\nDespite outshooting the Selects 43-16, the Tigers had to settle for a 3-3 draw in a back-and-forth contest. The game remained scoreless until late in the first period when the Selects broke through with just under seven minutes remaining. The Tigers responded quickly, with Tyson Tisdale finding the net off assists from Justin Gyori and Jake Smith to even the score heading into the second frame.\n\nThe middle period followed a similar pattern, with the Selects striking first before Bret Gerrits answered back for the Tigers with 35 seconds left. Justin Gyori and Hunter Adrian provided the assists on Gerrits' equalizer.\n\nThe Tigers finally took their first lead of the game in the third period when Kayde Budgell, assisted by Aden Michael, scored with approximately 11 minutes remaining.",

(NYSE: BFAM), a leading provider of high-quality education and care solutions designed to help employers support employees across life and career stages, announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2021. Bright Horizons operates approximately 1,000 early education and child care centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and India, and serves over 1,300 leading employers worldwide.\n\n**Second Quarter 2021 Financial Highlights:**\n\n1. Revenue increased by 50% to $441 million compared to the second quarter of 2020.\n2. Income from operations rose by 319% to $34 million.\n3. Net income reached $19 million, translating to diluted earnings per share of $0.31.\n\nAdjusted non-GAAP measures showed:\n- Adjusted income from operations grew by 25% to $34 million.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased by 13% to $68 million.\n- Adjusted net income was $30 million, resulting in diluted adjusted earnings per share of $0.49.\n\n**Operational Insights:**\n\nThe revenue surge was primarily due to increased enrollment in open child care centers and the re-opening of temporarily closed centers. While the centers are still operating below pre-pandemic levels, the phased recovery is evident. There were gains in traditional in-center and in-home care, though back-up care revenue decreased compared to the prior year's surge due to pandemic-related demand.\n\nStephen Kramer, CEO, stated, \"With full-time enrollment and backup usage returning, and most centers re-opening, our recovery from the pandemic is on track. I continue to be inspired by our dedicated teachers and center operations leadership, and am proud of the strong client partnerships that have enabled impactful solutions over the past 18 months.\"\n\n**2021 Outlook and Conference Call:**\n\nDespite global operational disruptions due to COVID-19, Bright Horizons remains focused on ramping up and reopening centers. The company expresses confidence in its business model and partnerships. However, due to ongoing uncertainties, Bright Horizons does not currently expect to provide full earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021.\n\nAn investor conference call will be hosted today at 5:00 pm ET to discuss the results and future expectations. Interested parties can join via provided contact details, with replays available through August 25, 2021.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity:**\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, Bright Horizons reported a strong balance sheet with $419 million in cash and equivalents and $400 million available for borrowing. Cash generated from operations for the first half of 2021 was approximately $135.7 million.\n\n**Presentation of Non-GAAP Measures:**\n\nThe company uses non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, and others as performance indicators. These measures are reconciled from GAAP in the attached table and are used internally for performance evaluation and incentive compensation.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements:**\n\nThis release includes forward-looking statements about anticipated results, which involve risks and uncertainties. These factors are detailed in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the company's Annual Report.\n\nFor more information, visit www.brighthorizons.com.\n\n**Condensed Financial Statements:**\n\nAccompanying the press release are condensed consolidated statements of income, balance sheets, cash flows, and segment information for the specified periods.\n\n---\n\nThis restructuring ensures clarity by presenting key financial results first, followed by operational insights, future outlook, and additional necessary information.

        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved flow and coherence:\n\n# From Young CEO to Author: A Conversation with Daniel Houghton\n\n## The Unexpected Leader\nDaniel Houghton became the CEO of the popular travel publishing company, Lonely Planet, at just 24. The company wasn't adapting to modern times and its future looked bleak. They needed someone young, someone who knew how to transition Lonely Planet into the digital age, and someone who understood both media and technology. That's when Houghton was tapped to lead the company. Under his leadership, the company modernized and developed a new generation of readers, and now has over 16.2 million followers on social media.\n\n## Early Challenges and Growth\n**Q: You became the CEO of Lonely Planet, one of the largest travel companies in the world, at just 24 years old. What was that like?**\n\n\"Well\u2026 the company didn't exactly come with its own guidebook (laughs). It was really rough in the beginning. I come from a media background, but I had never had such responsibility before. It's a huge company, but luckily, they have such a great team and it really became a group effort. But yeah.. there was a very steep learning curve for sure.\"\n\n**Q: Did you enjoy your time there?**\n\n\"Oh, of course! I mean, it's such an amazing company, it has a huge dedicated fanbase around the world, and travel is something I'm so passionate about. We hired people who loved the brand and loved travel, not people who were chasing money, and that made the entire company glow with such incredible energy.\"\n\n## A New Chapter\n**Q: You ended up stepping down from Lonely Planet, moved out to a farm in Tennessee and wrote a book. Explain how that happened.**\n\n\"Running a major company like Lonely Planet takes a lot out of you. It was an intense amount of travel and an intense amount of responsibility. We have a huge team that's spread out all over the world. I spent about 200-250 days per year on the road, which I absolutely loved and it was amazing, but it also has a way of wearing you out. By the end, after the company had made such growth, I felt that I had left my mark.\"\n\nHe continues, \"And unfortunately, then my dad got really sick, which I talk about in the forward of my book. So, I really wanted to be able to be close to my family. The farm thing came from me always wanting to live on a farm. I love woodworking, I love dogs, I love being outside, really, I just like a lot of old man things I guess! But yeah, with my dad being sick, I wanted some time off.\"\n\n## The Journey to Authorship\n**Q: How about the book? How did those pieces come together?**\n\n\"Well, my background is actually in journalism.",

        "The Buccaneers had a bye in Week 13, which meant there was no opportunity for Coach Bruce Arians to either openly critique or subtly criticize quarterback Tom Brady. Instead, Arians took the chance to praise Brady.\n\n\"It's been fantastic,\" Arians said to reporters when discussing his experience working with Brady. \"From the very start, bringing him here and watching him prepare and help our young players improve has been a joy. He's a fantastic competitor, and I love that about him. He's been there and done that, and he's helped so many of our guys, who haven't been there, believe they can achieve it. That's a huge part of it, and I couldn't ask for more from him.\"\n\nArians also commended Brady's ability to show up and work hard every day, even at 43 years old. \"I don't see any drop at all,\" Arians noted. \"I've had veteran guys who needed Wednesdays off, but he's not one of them. He's amazing in the way he takes care of himself, and he's taught a lot of young players how to look after themselves too.\"\n\nBrady's leadership and experience were further praised by Arians. \"There's no doubt about it,\" he said. \"I've been very fortunate to coach some of the best quarterbacks, all of whom possess that quality. Every single one I've coached\u2014Peyton Manning, Ben Roethlisberger, Andrew Luck as a rookie\u2014was amazing. Tom Brady, Tim Couch, Kelly Holcomb\u2014every successful quarterback I've worked with had the ability to make everyone in the huddle believe that this was the best play to be called and run. Then, they'd work with the guys on the side and bring them along. All the great ones do it.\"\n\nWhen asked about his frustration with the offense's struggles to execute scripted plays at the start of games, Arians remained positive. \"I think the big issue has been third downs,\" Arians explained. \"One way to fix it is by making first downs on first and second downs to avoid third down situations. But when we do face manageable third downs\u2014and, knock on wood, we've been playing pretty penalty-free\u2014we need to convert them to keep the chains moving and get into a rhythm.

During a recent event in Mumbai, Mukerji chose to wear a Sabyasachi outfit that caught fans' attention for its striking similarity to Ranveer Singh's Golden Temple anniversary attire.\n\n## Ranveer's Signature Style\n\nKnown for his bold and unconventional fashion choices, Ranveer Singh has established himself as Bollywood's style maverick. The actor, who has previously drawn comparisons to Govinda and Joaquin Phoenix, now shares a fashion moment with Rani Mukerji in their choice of traditional ensembles.\n\n## The Anniversary Look\n\nFor his first wedding anniversary celebration with Deepika Padukone, Singh visited Tirupati and Amritsar wearing a floral print copper-metallic kurta and pajama set, complemented by a matching Nehru jacket. The couple chose to honor their special day by wearing outfits reminiscent of their wedding attire.\n\n## Rani's Promotional Ensemble\n\nDuring the *Mardaani 2* promotions in Kolkata, Mukerji donned a similar Sabyasachi creation featuring the same metallic copper tone and floral prints. Her outfit consisted of a churidar and kurta combination paired with a matching net dupatta. She completed the look with:\n\n- Smokey eye makeup and bold lips\n- Simple middle-parted loose hair\n- Traditional golden Kolhapuri sandals\n\n## Style Verdict\n\nWhile both actors carried the similar designs distinctively, Singh embraced his signature maximalist approach by mixing multiple prints, yet maintaining a dapper appearance.

        "One of the key differences between Las Vegas and Montreal\u2019s regulations is the number of fans permitted at games.  The Golden Knights have enjoyed full-capacity crowds for their last five home games at T-Mobile Arena.  In contrast, the Canadiens were only recently allowed to host fans, capped at 2,500 spectators for their last two home games against the Winnipeg Jets.\n\nThe Quebec government has increased the limit to 3,500 for Friday\u2019s Game 3 and Sunday\u2019s Game 4. This will be the smallest crowd the Knights have played in front of during the postseason.\n\n\"I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll crank up the music, and the fans, however few, will be as loud as they can be,\" said right wing Ryan Reaves. \"We played in some arenas with only a couple thousand fans earlier this year, so we're used to it.  It will be a bit of an adjustment, though, going from playing in front of 18,000-plus in Vegas with the kind of atmosphere we have there.\"\n\nThe Golden Knights are venturing where no other U.S.-based NHL team has this season: Canada.  Montreal was the first NHL team to cross the U.S.-Canada border for Games 1 and 2 of this semifinal series in Las Vegas. Now, thanks to a special exemption from the Canadian government waiving the mandatory 14-day quarantine, it's the Knights' turn.\n\nThis trip is significantly different from their previous playoff travel due to the stricter rules and restrictions in Canada. However, the Knights remain focused on reaching their second Stanley Cup Final in four seasons.\n\nThe best-of-seven series is tied 1-1. Game 3 is Friday at 5 p.m. PT at the Bell Centre in Montreal.\n\n\"Not long ago, we were picking up our meals in boxes from the hotel lobby,\" said Knights coach Pete DeBoer. \"We'll manage. It's a business trip. We're here to win hockey games.\"\n\nThe Knights have experience with extended stays in Canada. They spent 51 days in the NHL\u2019s secure zone in Edmonton, Alberta, during their 2020 postseason run to the Western Conference Final.  Movement was largely restricted to the rink, hotel rooms, and a few common areas.  The current setup will be similar.\n\nWhile the government exemption prevents a full two-week quarantine, the Knights still face a modified version with limited public contact and daily COVID-19 testing, even though off-day testing had been discontinued for fully vaccinated individuals.  This contrasts with the relative freedom the Knights enjoyed during earlier playoff rounds, where fully vaccinated players could gather in small groups and dine at restaurants.\n\n\"Being here feels a little more like the beginning of the season when things were more tense,\" Reaves said.  \"We're not going out on the town anytime soon, so it's not a big deal.\"\n\nThese enhanced measures reflect the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and the U.S.  Nearly half (44.5 percent) of the American population is fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, compared to just 8.02 percent of Canadians, according to the Canadian government.  Consequently, many restrictions lifted in the U.S. remain in place in Canada.",
        "Opener Lizelle Lee led the charge with a blistering century as South Africa secured an emphatic 113-run victory over debutant Thailand in the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup at the Manuka Oval in Canberra. The Proteas posted a formidable total of 195 for three, the highest in the tournament's history, thanks to Lee\u2019s quickfire 101 and Sune Luus\u2019 unbeaten 61. Thailand faltered in their chase and was bowled out for 82 in 19.1 overs.\n\nSouth Africa now sits comfortably atop Group B and gears up to face Pakistan next, eyeing a spot in the semifinals. Thailand, known for early breakthroughs, capitalized on a momentary lapse when Dane van Niekerk gifted her wicket to Ratanporn Padunglerd by patting a full toss to mid-on.\n\nLee\u2019s dominant innings, featuring explosive stroke play, propelled South Africa's innings. She reached her half-century in just 35 balls and went on to score a century off 59 balls, including a variety of exquisite shots. Luus provided crucial support, securing her fourth T20I fifty, as South Africa set a record total with contributions from other batters like Chloe Tryon.\n\nThailand\u2019s batting struggled from the start, losing wickets at regular intervals to the relentless South African bowling attack. Shabnim Ismail wreaked havoc, picking up three quick wickets, including a sensational hat-trick. Despite some resistance from Onnicha Kamchomphu, Thailand's innings crumbled under the pressure as South Africa wrapped up the match comprehensively.\n\nIn the end, South Africa's all-round performance, led by Lee's explosive century and Ismail's fiery bowling, ensured a convincing victory over Thailand in a memorable encounter at the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup.",
        "MUMBAI England's humiliating series defeat in India painfully exposed an alarming paucity in the side's slow bowling options and drove home the fact they will continue to struggle in South Asia until they unearth some world-class spinners.\n\nRetired off-spinner Graeme Swann had bemoaned England's indifferent approach towards slow bowling before the five-match series started and his fears were confirmed after the touring side were handed a 4-0 drubbing.\n\nThe alarm bells would have been ringing when England's spinners were out-bowled in Bangladesh in October, where the side lost their first-ever test against the hosts in a series regarded by many as an appetizer for the Indian leg of the trip.\n\nThat 1-1 drawn series did little to prepare England's batsmen for the main course as India's spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin, the world's top-ranked test bowler, and Ravindra Jadeja helped themselves to 54 wickets.\n\nBy comparison, England's main spinners Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali combined for 33 wickets, and the other four slow bowlers used on the tour -- Zafar Ansari, Liam Dawson, Gareth Batty, and part-timer Joe Root -- only claimed seven more between them.\n\nJames Anderson, England's most prolific wicket-taker, had taken 12 wickets in the four tests in 2012, prompting then India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni to dub the seamer as the difference between the sides.",

        "Fans of Dave Chappelle's Comedy Central series, Chappelle's Show, will be surprised if they attempt to watch the stand-up comedian's sketch show on Netflix tonight. This is because Chappelle's Show has been removed from the streaming platform. The comedy series was initially released on both Netflix and HBO Max on November 1, marking a significant move for Chappelle, who has maintained a multi-special deal with Netflix for years. Chappelle even highlighted this major release event during his opening monologue while hosting the most recent episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\nHowever, the situation took a turn in the weeks following the show's debut on Netflix and HBO Max. On Tuesday, Chappelle uploaded a video to his Instagram titled \"Unforgiven.\" This 18-minute video appears to have been recorded during a recent set by Chappelle. In it, he reveals that he was the one who initiated the removal of Chappelle's Show from Netflix. He linked this decision to ongoing disputes with ViacomCBS and Comedy Central, alleging that they did not compensate him as part of the show's licensing agreement.\n\nIn the video, Chappelle elaborates on his history of disagreements with Viacom and why he departed from Chappelle's Show in 2005. He stated, \"If you are streaming that show, you are fencing stolen goods. They stole that (show) from me, they just took it,\" and further expressed, \"I found out these people were streaming my work and never had to ask me or they never had to tell me. Perfectly legal because I signed the contract, but is that right? I didn\u2019t think so.\"\n\nChappelle expressed gratitude to Netflix for respecting his request to remove the show, sharing with his audience, \"(Netflix) agreed that they would take it off their platform just so I could feel better. That\u2019s why I [work] with Netflix because they pay me my money, they do what they say they are going to do, and they went above and beyond what you could expect from a businessman.\"\n\nThe veteran stand-up then appealed directly to his audience, expressing his pain and disappointment with his treatment by Viacom: \"So I\u2019m not going to the agents, I\u2019m coming to my real boss \u2014 I\u2019m coming to you. I\u2019m begging you \u2014 if you ever liked me, if you ever think there was anything worthwhile about me, I\u2019m begging you, please don\u2019t watch that show.",

        "## CLX Communications and Juniper Research Forecast Quadrupling of Enterprise CPaaS Spending by 2022\n\n**London and Stockholm \u2013 February 20, 2018** \u2013 CLX Communications AB (publ) (XSTO: CLX) and Juniper Research have released a new white paper forecasting that enterprise spending on Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) will quadruple to $6.7 billion by 2022.\n\nJuniper Research estimates the CPaaS market grew by 50% to more than $1.6 billion in 2017. While early CPaaS adoption was primarily driven by agile, disruptive, digital-first companies, the landscape is shifting.  Established businesses are recognizing the crucial role of differentiation and personalization in attracting and retaining customers, with customer engagement becoming a key competitive battleground.\n\nCPaaS is a cloud-based platform that allows businesses to seamlessly integrate communication capabilities\u2014such as voice, video, and messaging\u2014into their applications without building backend infrastructure and interfaces. This empowers them to effortlessly add features like chatbots, service agents, and contact center functionality to their customer-facing applications.\n\nThe white paper, \"Communications Platforms \u2013 Transforming Enterprises into Digital Innovators,\" provides an overview of the CPaaS market and its growth potential. It also charts the evolution from SaaS to PaaS and demonstrates the effectiveness of CPaaS through various use cases.\n\n\"We live in a hyper-connected world where we routinely engage with friends and family using a range of voice, video, and messaging technologies,\" commented Robert Gerstmann, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer at CLX. \"As consumers, we expect to engage with our chosen brands and businesses whenever and however we like. CPaaS enables enterprises to rapidly innovate to meet this consumer demand, making it easy to integrate a range of communication functions within existing customer-facing apps and online systems. As our white paper with Juniper illustrates, it's no longer just tech-native businesses innovating through CPaaS. Many established multinationals are now recognizing the importance of omnichannel communication for attracting and engaging the customer of tomorrow.\"\n\nDr. Windsor Holden, Head of Forecasting & Consultancy at Juniper Research, added: \"The rapid pace of technological change can be challenging even for the most agile enterprises. New technologies and devices spawn new demand patterns, making it difficult to keep pace, let alone future-proof operations. CPaaS offers a highly flexible solution that enables greater scalability while reducing implementation time.  Enterprises using CPaaS can continually evolve their customer engagement channels in line with consumer demand, which is why we predict enterprise spend on CPaaS to surge in the next four years.\"\n\nDownload the \"Communications Platforms \u2013 Transforming Enterprises into Digital Innovators\" white paper from the CLX Communications website: [https://www.clxcommunications.com/help/downloads-reports/](https://www.clxcommunications.com/help/downloads-reports/)\n\n\n**About CLX Communications**\n\nCLX Communications (CLX) is a leading CPaaS provider to enterprises and mobile operators.

        "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is the most well-known among cryptocurrencies, experiencing a significant price surge since its introduction. Notable financial experts, including Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman, have recommended investing in Bitcoin to some extent.\n\nWhile investing in Bitcoin may offer potential returns, it shouldn't be the primary focus of your retirement savings strategy. Here's why:\n\nDiversification is key, even with Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin has shown remarkable growth, its real-world application remains limited, and its track record is relatively short compared to traditional assets. The future of Bitcoin is uncertain, and its value is solely based on public perception, making it a risky investment that could result in long-term losses.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may carry more risk than established investments like index funds or stocks, reliance on it alone to secure a comfortable retirement is unwise. A well-rounded retirement portfolio should not hinge on a single investment, whether it's Bitcoin, Apple shares (NASDAQ: AAPL), or an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nRelying solely on one asset poses a high risk in retirement planning, as Social Security only replaces 40% of pre-retirement income. A diversified portfolio, including stocks, bonds, index funds, and possibly cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risk while potentially increasing returns for retirement savings.\n\nPractical factors also come into play, as most 401(k) plans do not allow investment in Bitcoin. It's important to allocate funds to traditional retirement accounts to benefit from employer contributions and ensure financial security in retirement.\n\nIf you believe in the future of Bitcoin and wish to include it in your investment strategy, that's fine. However, it shouldn't be your sole reliance for financial stability in retirement, as the viability of virtual currencies over time is uncertain.\n\nIn conclusion, maintaining a balanced investment portfolio is crucial for retirement planning. While Bitcoin may offer opportunities, it should be one component of a diversified portfolio tailored to meet your long-term financial goals. Remember, a thoughtful mix of assets can help secure a comfortable retirement lifestyle.\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of November 10, 2021\n\nChristy Bieber has no position in any of the mentioned stocks.

        "Here's a restructured and improved version of the game review:\n\n# Inscryption: Where Card Games Meet Dark Fantasy\n*By Anusha Ganapathi*  \n*Express News Service*\n\nCHENNAI: In the dimly lit confines of a mysterious cabin, I find myself trapped with only a table, cursed candles, and an enigmatic bearded stranger whose skeletal fingers and bright eyes pierce through the darkness. This is Inscryption \u2013 a deceptively complex puzzle-based deck-building game that masterfully weaves simple board game mechanics into a haunting video game experience.\n\nThe stranger, my cryptic host, spins a tale of forests and caravans, populating my imagination with helpful witches, greedy hunters, and peculiar packrats. These become my guardian creatures in a high-stakes card game where victory is the only path forward. Failure means starting anew, but each attempt brings its own rewards.\n\nWhile the game's card system might initially seem like an alien language to newcomers, Inscryption excels at visual instruction. Players begin with a starter deck of woodland creatures, centered around the humble squirrel. These small creatures serve as sacrificial pawns, their power transferring to stronger cards that can then assault the enemy's defenses and tip the scales of battle in your favor.\n\nAs you progress and overcome mini-bosses, your deck evolves. The beauty of Inscryption lies in its flexibility \u2013 veterans of card games can dive deep into complex strategies, while newcomers like myself can opt for a more straightforward approach, focusing on powerful creatures and maximizing their stats at every opportunity. With the right combination, victory can be achieved in a single, devastating move.\n\nThough it took me no fewer than 15 attempts to reach the third boss, each defeat felt meaningful. Every loss offered opportunities to refine my deck and potentially discover more powerful cards on subsequent runs. The game's refreshing approach to failure, combined with its mysterious narrative, kept me engaged until the very end.\n\n**Rating: 4/4 sacrifices**\n\n*Inscryption is available on PC through the Steam store.*",
