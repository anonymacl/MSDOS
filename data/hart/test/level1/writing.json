        "``.... and that concludes your training. Welcome to Surely Insurance, and before you partner off to start at your desks are there any questions. Anything we didn't cover in the training? Yes Philip what would you like to know?\" \n\n\"Our most profitable customer, oh that is a good one. And not a question I have been asked before. I imagine most of you think it was Jeanne Calment, but alas no. Lets have a look shall we.\" \n\n\"Peter can you put our customer database on screen for us.\" \n\n\"Thank you\" \n\n\"Now build a custom search. Start by adjusting all payments for inflation. And why do we do that?\" \n\n\"That's right Simone, it allows us to see the absolute value of their insurance payments in today's money. We want to be duly diligent in all our work, even answering each others questions. Especially as you have managed to pique my interest as well.\" \n\n\"The next step will be to sum all of the payments the customer has made. Again what must we bear in mind?\" \n\n\"Quite right Maggie, that we ensure we sort by individual customer not joint or family policies. These are how much more profitable for us?\" \n\n\"Fantastic, and where to we derive this extra 20 % per person from?\" \n\n\"Oh splendid John, as he says intangible benefits. Something we expect you to do rather well on selling. Remember'The only way to be sure, it be be Surely Insured', and that piece of mind comes at a premium.\" \n\n\"So the final step is to output that data to a simple table. Lets only look for the top 100, saves a little computing time. And voila, thank you Peter.\" \n\n\"You can see here our most profitable customer is a Dorothy Walpole. She paid out over \u00a310.5 million in life insurance premiums. One of our first ever customers. You might be surprised that we digitised his records, but we like to remember where we came from.\" \n\n\"The green mark next to the accounts? Well we did cover this earlier. Can anyone tell Mr. Shepton what that means?\" \n\n\"Oh you know that it indicates an active account.\"",
        "I remember well how it was before. It used to be easy: You'd leave your home, move away from the area you'd known your entire life, away from your parents. You'd build a home of your own. Quiet. Right down on the water\u2014the land was plentiful then. Eventually you'd find a companion. One who would share your home, bear your children. And the cycle would start again. \n\nOccasionally something would happen that would disrupt things. A flood would sweep away homes, sometimes yours. There would be a fire and the available wood would dwindle and you'd have to move your family. Ones that you knew, neighbors, would go out and not come back, just disappear one day. Sometimes you'd hear the loud alarm from your neighbors, a bolt from the blue that warned of some nearing danger. But for the most part, life was simple, and luck was in our favor. \n\nThen it changed. Then there was the fear and uncertainty. They came. \n\nI remember well the first time I felt the fear. I was out gathering for my family when I came across the body. It was one of my neighbors, I'd recently had a loud fight with him, keeping him away from my wife whom he sought to draw away from me. I'd have killed him if he touched her, but he didn't deserve this. He lay there, still and dead, his skin ripped from his body. I did my best to process what was before me, but I hardly had time before I heard a scream in a familiar voice. I ran to my daughter, caught in some manner of devious trap, begging for my help. And I saw them. Giants, two of them, casually walking in their foreign gait toward my poor, terrified daughter, and I could do nothing. One of them pointed at me and said something in an unintelligible language, and the other raised a thing to point at me.",
        "Mike couldn't listen anymore to the overwhelming evidence presented before the judge, so he tuned them out and thought about the true events of that night. It wasn't even six, spaghetti noodles were boiling on the stove, and he was going through bills at the kitchen table. It was summer, so the sky was only just beginning to darken. His daughter, Cathy was outside. He called through the window for her and after the second call with no reply, he was dashing out of the house in a panic. \n\nCathy was curled into a ball on the side of the road, dark red spots pooled on the tar covered skid marks that drew his eye to the'79 Cutlass in the ditch. No driver in sight. Mike's mind had gone into overdrive as he ran to his daughter's side, trying to assess the damage \u201c Cat, Little Cat, \u201d he had whined, turning his daughter over, \u201c Cathy? Can you hear me? \u201d \n\nSlowly one green eye opened. She looked at me and smiled. Mike's stomach dropped in relief, she was not dead. But there was so much blood! Mike's stomach flipped and dropped again, tightly clenched to her body was our cat Pancakes. Pancakes lay limp and broken in her arms. The blood belonged to the cat. Cathy must have saw what happened and ran over to our cat, trying to protect him even though he was already dead. \n\nMike then took the blood soaked cat away from the girl and told her to go back up to the house and turn the stove off before the water boiled over. Meanwhile he got the shovel out from the garage and walked to the public trail entrance near the empty'79 Cutlass. \n\nHe hadn't thought it was odd that whoever ran over Pancakes just left his car and vanished, because he was busy digging a hole in the little patch of woods.",
        "Mr. Kim stood as his eyes widened. He realized how terrible he was, and his father, and his grandfather. They were the most hated and feared people in the world, but were also the butt of scores of jokes, and a laughing stock of a nation. Mr. Kim retired to the corner of the cave, and began weeping. \n\nHe couldn't wish for death, that's against the rules. If he wished his grandfather wasn't born, then he couldn't exist to find the genie, and a time travel paradox would be created. No, he couldn't fix the past, but he also couldn't pretend it never happened. He approached the genie, wiping tears away from his eyes. \n\n\"I wish the people of North Korea had the strength and knowledge to rebel against the government.\" \n\nThe genie waved his hand, and the countryside began to rumble with the calls of revolution. Kim peaked outside the cave, as the countryside was rampant with fires and makeshift weaponry. \n\n\"You know,\" began the genie, \"They're going to gut you like a pig.\" \n\n\"No they won't.\" \n\n\"How do you figure?\" \n\nMr. Kim tented his fingers. \"Although I have realized my crimes, intelligence is no indicator of morality. Isn't that right?\" \n\n\"I don't care about morality, I'm a genie. People always ask for immoral things!\" \n\n\"I figured. So, I wish I was an emaciated Korean woman.\" \n\nThe genie looked defeated, but waved his hand towards the evil dictator. \n\n\"What are you going to do now?\" The genie curiously asked. \n\n\"I'm going to take revenge on those who convinced me I was benevolent.\" \n\nWith that, the world's most insane dictator left the cave into the fiery meadows below, and joined a mob of angry, starving folks, heading for Pyongyang.",
        "I loved the feeling of the cool night air from my open window. I was leaning against my windowsill, staring up at the stars, softly singing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. I focused my attention on a certain star, the biggest one that I could see. But as I repeated the song, staring at the star, I realized it was.... growing *bigger*. Bigger and bigger, until its light illuminated my entire room. And then the light rapidly dimmed, dulling out to a smooth glow, leaving a humanlike figure in its wake. The figure stood, or floated rather, directly outside my window, and then a gentle voice rang out: \"Hello? Where am I?\" \n\nI didn't know what to say, how to react, or whether this was a dream. The words had left my mouth nearly before I realized it: \"This is my room.\" \n\n\"It's nice,\" the voice murmured. The figure edged closer, and its features sharpened until I could make out what it was: a girl. She looked like an ordinary girl, about my age, except she was kind of blueish gray, and glowing. I was hardly confused, just mesmerized. I decided to just speak, discover who this was. Maybe I could make a new friend. \"Who are you? What's your name? How did-\" \n\nMy questions were interrupted by the girl's small giggle. \"You ask a lot of questions. My name's Ella, and I'm an angel. I didn't wan na stay up in the sky,'cause it was boring, so I came down here. What's your name?\" \n\n\"I'm Devon, and I'm seven. I didn't know angels were real, do a lot of angels leave the sky?\" \n\n\"Devon?\" Mom's voice came from the other side of the bedroom door. \"Who are you talking to?\" \n\nI gasped in horror, would Mom like Ella? Would Ella like Mom? I looked to the angel for answers, and she smiled.",
        "Drinking wouldn't help him, but he sat down at the bar in the ballroom all the same. It was busily being prepared by the worker bees who'd been hired to make sure the most joyous and wonderful union about to take place would do so with the utmost perfection. \n\nHis head was pounding. It was pounding harder now than it had when he'd woken up six hours ago, two hours late for Groomsman photo's his best friend had sworn would not take place without him. \n\n\"Fucking Gatorade\" he muttered to himself. \n\n\"Only got the regular kind, Jack\" said an approaching bar tender. David hated bartender talk. \n\nHe didn't look at him but just said \"Whiskey, double, clean\". \n\nThe bartender nodded and went to fix his drink. It was ready quite before David had expected it to be. Where it was usually a fork in the road between a path of drinking and not drinking, David only saw one path with many drinks along the way. \n\nHe'd either numb the pain or it would come slurring out of him at some point. It was up in the air. \n\n\"That'll be 18 buck-aroos, buckaroo\" the bartender said. David looked at him but said nothing. It was supposed to be an open bar. A gift from the grave of the brides father and the bank account that held the trust fund he'd left her. The thought revealed a memory from the night before.... and it stung. \n\n'What kind of idiot sends a 200 dollar wreath to a headstone' he thought himself pathetically. \n\n'The same kind who spends the night watching the Kiera Knightley-Rick from the Walking Dead scenes from Love, Actually on a drunken loop all night long', he answered his thought. \n\nHe sat there sadly and quietly for a moment. He needed a change of subject but the weed he'd smoked before arriving for the photo's in an effort to cover up his hangover was currently back firing on him. Instead of dulling the pain of his headache and the relaxing him, he'd ended up with a smokers head ache swimming in an ocean of tortured thoughts. \n\n'What a poetic mother fucker', he thought.'Shakespeare would shit himself'. \n\nThe bartender was approaching at just the moment the whiskey he'd shot down was affecting him just. No doubt he noticed an empty glass and walked over to refill it. \n\n\"I thought the bar was open....asshole\" he said. Anger swirling inside him.",
        "As the last of the kaiju beast monster's ashes fall to the ground, like black snowflakes on an autumn's night, I take a minute to breathe. In the distance, the sirens screech while above me, the chopper blades rip through the night sky like the demon's heartbeat. \n\n\"Boss, we need to go,\" Boris tells me. \"They're coming.\" \n\nI close my eyes and sigh. Maybe this time when I speak, things will be different. \n\n\"Silence, you imbecile, or I, the great Dr. Demento shall eradicate your spleen with my ray of evil cosmic death.\" Another epic failure in communications. It wasn't my fault. It was *him* -- always *him*. \n\n\"Uh.... sure boss. Sorry,\" Boris says. \"Look, we really need to get out of here. I mean, we had no business being here in the first place.\" \n\nWe had plenty of business being here. An evil monster, the size of a skyscraper, was tearing up the financial district of my city, eating bankers and actuaries like pop tarts. If I didn't stop it, then who would? \n\n\"The cops are only minutes away. Like always, they're going to blame us for all the death and destruction,\" Boris cries out. \n\nMaybe I can reason with the cops this time? Maybe, for once, *he'll* shut up and allow me to talk. \"Let those pigs come. I will crush them like I crush walnuts in between my thighs, for I am Dr. Demento, master of cosmic death, disruptor of wholesome truth, and manipulator of our monochromatic existence.\" \n\nNo, no, no, shut up, just shut up and let me talk. Let the real me talk.... please! \n\nI watch as the first police offer shows up. He gets out of his car and before a word of warning, points his gun straight at my head. He radios in. \"Guys, we have Dr. Demento again. I'll need all the back up I can. Is Ultra Boy available? Someone light the Ultra beacon.\" \n\nI shake my head. Not Ultra Boy again. Over the course of my super-hero career, that imbecile has knocked out four of my teeth and displaced my hip twice. If he'd only taken the opportunity to listen to the real me, violence wouldn't have been necessary. Each and every time, it was always a misunderstanding. I was always doing what's best for the city. \n\nI notice the police officer's hand trembling. His finger is resting on the trigger. There's no need for this. We're both on the same side. Perhaps I can convince him to drop his weapon? I lick my lips, and then try to speak words of reason. \"Communist swine, of subpar intelligence. Don't point your weapons at me, unless you wish to gum food for the rest of your useless existence.\"",
        "The best part of waking up is breakfast. It's better when someone else is making it, but even if I'm begrudgingly making it, the second that bacon hits the pan, the whole world seems to light up. I drop a couple pieces and as soon as the smell hits me, I smile. It's the perfect way to start the morning. The world couldn't possibly be better as I stare out my open kitchen window at the birds playing in the new spring air. I grab a couple eggs out of the fridge and toss them into the pan after dishing out the bacon. The pan crackles a bit, then settles down and I lightly add salt and fresh ground pepper to my eggs. My mouth is watering by the time my meal has finished, and I sit down eagerly. As soon as the egg hits my mouth, I wake up, thrown back into the horrible reality that I find myself in. As I look around the the basement, I can feel the gag in my mouth muffle any words I've might've said, and as I look at the nub that was once my hand, I start to weep.",
        "Here's a cliche for you- love hurts. But no, really. Love is painful. \n\nEspecially when someone you love doesn't love you back. You sit and cry in the shower as it hits you like a ton of bricks that they will never care about you in the way that you want- no need them to. They sit and go about their life as if they didn't do anything to you. As if they can still be in your life even though whenever you see or even think about them, your heart continues to break. It's not like you can tell them you love them because that's not fair to you or them. Admitting that you love them and having them tell you they don't love you back will crush you; having them pity you will crush you. \n\nBut you keep trying to find it. Even though this pain can be so unbearable, you keep going. That first kiss makes it worth it- the awkward, heart racing, whole body tingling mess. The first time they take your hand in theirs and you can't help but smile. When they kiss you on your shoulder in the middle of the night, just to remind you they're there.",
        "Bodies were everywhere, his personal staff, young men surrounded by pools of blood from the bullet wounds, one man even looked like he was burned badly before he died having burn marks all over his arms and neck. There I found him clutching a book with a hole directly between his eyes. I still can not believe he took the satisfaction from us so close! I flipped through the pages of the blood covered book wondering what it was that the scumbag had to cherish before he took his life like a coward. I began to read: \n.... that this is what the world needs? Who are these spies and how are they infiltrating my personal guard? Just yesterday as I was riding back to the capital, I noticed something was off about my driver who had such an interesting metal bracelet hanging on his left wrist. All I could make out were numbers that seemed to glow as if made of light. No sooner did we reach the capital when the driver turned the wheel sharply to send us into the wall preventing the car from careening down into the waters below! Thankfully the wall stopped the vehicle but was clearly damaged. Just as I was regaining my wits, I noticed the vehicle was backing up as if to align itself for another go at the damaged wall of the bridge. I threw open the door as the force from acceleration threw me off balance. I leaped from the car just in time as I rolled forcefully into the bottom of the retaining wall and the car fell crashing and quickly sinking to the bottom of the river.",
        "I moved to Seattle after the war, but didn't stay long. The city was too loud, or I was too jumpy. Probably both. I went north to Bellevue, but that, too, was too much for me. Horns honking, too-loud radios, airplanes flying overhead. One night I went to an Indian casino. It was just rows and rows clanking, singing and flashing slot machines. I couldn't bear it. I went into the bathroom and cried like a baby. The very next day I sold my Honda Accord, bought an old 4Runner and went into the deep blue woods. I can't believe that was six years ago already. \n\nI had a cabin - really just four walls, a roof and a wood stove. The deer were plentiful, and I fished in a nearby stream. For the most part, I was content. \n\nOnce every three months or so, I'd head into town to stock up on essentials. Sometimes, I'd spend the night with Lucy, who I met at Wallmart, of all places. She said she liked the way I smelled, that there was something authentic about it. I got her pregnant. She didn't expect anything of me, which was nice, as I didn't have anything to provide. \n\nWhen the baby was born I went to see it. I was expecting something profound, some kind of bonding moment. But that didn't happen. It was just a baby. Lucy said she thought the baby should see where I live. I didn't say no. I didn't say anything, actually, but something about my expression gave the impression that that was never going to happen, and it never did. \n\nI watched my child grow in three month intervals. He always treated me like a stranger. \n\nOvertime, I went into town less and less. I became more self-sufficient. I learned the seasons. My harvests were more fruitful. I lost track of how long it had been since I'd seen Lucy, and my son. \n\nI went to bed on one clear winter night and dreamed I was back at war. The syncopated popping of automatic gunfire, the screaming, lying in dirt, crawling through a doorway, and finally, safety. \n\nThe next day I went into town. My beard had grown long and matted.",
        "\"Bananas?\" \n\n'Bananas. Lifetime supply.\" \n\n\"Guess I should have woken up sooner, then,\" Dave grumbled. His head hurt. This all felt like a bad dream. \n\nThe last thing Dave could remember was getting into his car to go to work. A regular Tuesday morning in September. 1975. And now here he was, sitting in a hospital bed having awoken from a 40-year coma, apparently the winner of a \"Pass the Potassium\" radio contest right before his accident. His prize? A lifetime supply of bananas. And after learning of Dave's condition, the radio station - not sure of their legal requirement to supply a lifetime supply of anything to a man in a coma - had been sending the hospital a banana each week for the last 40 years. \n\nDave was peeling the latest delivery. \n\n\"What about Lucy?\" Dave asked between bites. Boy was he hungry. \"How is my sister?\" \n\n\"I'm sorry to tell you sir, but she passed away a few years ago. Cancer, I believe. But she became a very successful woman before her passing, founding numerous humanitarian and animal-rights causes. While they have all since wound down or been assumed by other organizations, Lucy did bequeath one to you should you ever awake: the American Penguin Society. It looks after penguins lost off the East coast, before releasing them back into their native habitat.\" \n\n\"So you're telling me I'm responsible for these penguins now?\" Dave asked incredulously. \n\n\"That's correct, sir.\" \n\nPenguins and bananas. What was next? \n\n\"I'd like to be left alone, please.\"",
        "\u201c Why do you kill? \u201d \n\nToby lay on the floor allowing his inner monologue to wander for a moment, as it usually does when the Sun is high in the sky, shining through the gap in the curtains. Why indeed? \n\nWas he taught how to do it? Was it a bad upbringing that drove him to murder? Doubtful. He lived a life of luxury ever since he was brought home. He had affection from his family, and offered it back in spades. No real unhappy moments as far as he could remember. He certainly didn't do it in desperation, as he had all the food, drink, and company anyone could ever hope for. \n\nWas it to protect what was rightfully his? Again, not the right answer. He and his family did not have any major threats. Sure, the occasional accident on the nearby roads could be considered a liability, but it was out of his control. No real enemies, at least none that could be a real danger. Besides, he kept a look out all the time, watching over the neighbors and making sure nothing strange happened. Mrs Jenkins across the road did pass away a few months ago, but that had nothing to do do with him. Probably nothing to do with him. Maybe. \n\nHe shook his foot to stop an itch, caused by the Sun slowly creeping up his leg as he pondered. \n\nThe question remained. Why? What caused him to stalk around, looking for prey? Why did he take innocent victims from their families, brought them home, and pulled their intestines out? The macabre display that his loved ones reviled, but tolerated. \n\nThe thought conjured up his most recent kill. A small body that was difficult to catch, but it was not nimble enough to get away from Toby's finely-honed physique and techniques. He relived the feelings of those few seconds of slaughter. Happiness. Satisfaction. A feeling of release. \n\nThe Sun started to dazzle Toby, warming his face and telling him to get up. \n\nHis memory stirred something inside him. He had a compulsion to do it again.",
        "\"What do you mean'no'?\" the man asked the elderly toy maker on his bench. The older man simply shook his head in response, too caught up in creating his next invention: A wooden toy soldier. He was still putting on the finishing touches, slowly and carefully hand painting the last few coats of color to give it the life it deserved. Though his hands were aged, they had most certainly not lost their touch nor finesse. \n\n\"I said, what do you mean you're not going to make a toy for my son this year? I can pay you as much as you god damn want, you old fart!\" His questions were turning into demands at this point, the wealthy businessman being driven to his knees by a lowly toy maker. He was making himself looking like a fool, but that didn't matter at the moment because the shop was empty aside from the two of them. This didn't include the dolls sitting upon rows and rows of shelves, staring down upon them with their black, beady little eyes. Finally, the old toy maker replied, but if only to get the disturbance to leave his premise. \n\n\"I've told you, your boy doesn't deserve my creations. Every year it's the same. I put in hours upon hours of effort, bucketloads of sweat for your precious son's birthday present. And what do I get in return? Broken pieces and scraps returned to me the very next week. If he doesn't know how to treat his toys with respect, then he's not getting any toys!\" he snapped with ferocious fervor. He coughed a little, his anger having clouded his mind. \"LEAVE!\" he managed to spit out one last time before entering a coughing fit. \n\nThe toy maker abruptly fell to the floor and grasped his throat. He was choking on something and by the shade of purple his face was turning, it was apparent he couldn't breath. His other arm reached for the businessman, pleading for help. Help that never came. The wealthy man simply watched with the cruelest of smiles his lips had ever made. He watched on without remorse as the toy maker's life slowly ebbed away from him.",
        "The old man stared at Jim for what felt like an eternity. Jim could feel the heat of the gaze from those nearly 3/4 century old eyes. The silence was painful and with every tick of the clock, Jim felt his chances of survival grow ever slimmer. When the old man spoke it was with a harsh rasp. \n\n\"You fucked up, Jimbo.\" \n\nJim nodded his head. There was nothing to say, really. He did fuck up. \n\n\"We went over it t'ree times. All you had to do was wait for the guys then drive away when they got inda car.\" \n\nJim nodded his head and made a motion like he was going to respond to the old man's point. With a quickness the defied his age, the old man put the back of his hand across Jim's mouth. A searing pain entered Jim's head and he winced. The old man settled himself and looked at Jim again. \"What should I do wit' you, Jimbo?\" \n\nJim looked dolefully at the old man, who nodded letting Jim know he could speak. Jim stuttered slightly, but managed to find his voice. \"I guess letting me go is out of the question.\" \n\nJim looked for a response, but the old man only stared blankly, leaning back in his chair with his hands over his belly. Jim spoke again, \"Could I at least get something to drink?\" \n\nThe old man had no emotion in his voice when he spoke, \"No use watering dead flowers.\"",
        "Usually I don't draw pictures on paper. I suck at drawing. I can't even draw a line without it swerving away. \n\nToday I tried drawing again, just for no reason. However, the curves were almost smooth and lines were straight, which I was happy about, but I didn't notice the smoothness of my drawing or how my pencil was making deep black marks. ``....What did she say?.... (x^4) ^8 + k^7?.....I wonder what conversations my friends are going to have online...\" Were a couple of my bouncing thoughts. I seem to daydream sometimes. Before I knew it, the bell rang, startling me into finishing the drawing. I quickly grabbed the paper and placed it into my binder along with my calculator and other papers, not noticing it's very faint glow. \n\n\"Your drawing looked nice.\" Was a comment that one student told me. As I hate so much to interact with other students (Most of the students in school are assholes, that would say something rude to me so I just ignore them all.), I dismissed it without a second thought and waited for dismissal. \n\nI sit by myself on the bus looking out the window. We go the exact same route everyday, passing the cherry tree. Today, my sightseeing was halted by a sudden tingling on my back. \n\nWhen I get home I do the same stuff each time.

        "We had been sent on a divine mission. Our god, Volcano, had commanded that we go and rescue the noble savages from their invaders. \n\nBut the enemy is weak: they have rejected the embrace of Volcano. They worship Water. Water is a weak god: he can not even survive on most planets, and his followers are condemned to hop between them. \n\nSadly, we discovered that Water had populated one of our planets, as well. And the enemy was coming. \n\nLast year three enemy ships had penetrated the protective force field around the C-3801 system. We intercepted a communication: the enemy intended to occupy that solar system as a base to launch an attack on our own. \n\nBut Volcano reminded us that we have a duty to save the C-3801 system. For the third planet therein has been the greatest battleground between Volcano and Water. Both gods sent missionaries to populate the planet, and a holy war erupted. \n\nWater's minions seem to think that the humans, those lowly creatures, will aid him in building a forward assault base. The enemy has been attempting to steal them away before they receive Volcano's enlightenment. \n\nRight now, the humans do not truly live; they merely exist. They are observed 41 hours per day, 1312 days per year, and the scientists at home fail to see their reason for existence. \n\nWe are protecting the humans from the wrath of Water, but they are slow to understand. They are indoctrinated, but we will help them. \n\nI am a doctor of humans. I fix them. My partner and I spoke to the humans before administering the cure for Water worship.",
        "*Face my demons.... save myself.... * \n\nThe words repeated over and over again in my mind. I knew what I had to do. I could feel the subtle pull of the medication dragging me under, and my last thoughts were of home. \n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n\nThe sharp sting of the lake air pulled me out of my stupor. I sat up. The breeze whistled through the pine trees. \n\nSilence. \n\n*Face my demons. Save myself. * \n\nI stood, slowly.

        "\u201c It's obviously the janitor \u201d, I said absent-mindedly as the show's title sequence faded out. \u201c This is just gon na'be an hour long exposition as to why. \u201d \n\nMy friends all shushed me and leaned in closer, spilling some of the popcorn from their bowl. Sitting on the floor in front of the couch, a blanket wrapped around my legs and my back against the couch, I felt the piece fall into my hair and worked to get it out. \n\n\u201c Would you quit fidgeting? \u201d Marie jokingly half-shouted. She liked to crack jokes that were no-so-secretly things she actually wanted to say. \n\n\u201c Sorry. \u201d \n\nI leaned back against the couch and slid the piece of popcorn underneath it, hoping that I would forget about it and not feel guilt compelling me to pick it up later. I zoned back into the show. It was this half-minded crime procedural about a group of detectives who could transform into animals. Not bad as far as premises go, but the execution was flawlessly awful. I literally had to laugh out loud at points. But my friends loved it. \n\n\u201c How could it be anyone but the janitor? \u201d \n\n\u201c Shh! \u201d \n\nI was starting to think my friends were half-wits. The janitor is the only one who had any motivation to kill Jennifer! She didn't feed his fish while he was on vacation, and he got pissed. Hell I almost forgot to feed Marie's fish while she was gone, and even then she practically got a weed-whacker out on me! \n\n\u201c I bet anyone here fifty bucks it's the janit- \u201c \n\nA pillow hit my square in the mouth before I could finish. Everyone laughed, myself included. Honestly, though, it had to be the janitor. Every time he sees Jennifer's husband he gets that little twinkle in his eye Marie gets when she sees Stacey from next door (who's house we teepee'd last summer).",
        "\"You live here alone?\" Yvette asked as Cheyenne pulled her jacket off and threw it on the couch. \n\n\"Feels that way, sometimes,\" Cheyenne replied. \"Margo comes in and out as she pleases. I can go days without seeing her.\" \n\n\"Ah.\" Yvette looked around taking in the odd clash of furniture: a beaten up wooden coffee table in front of a yellow couch, a dining table with a glass top surrounded by wire chairs that clearly belonged outside. There were a few paintings here and there, many of them giving off a serious *D\u00eda de los Muertos* vibe. \n\n\"You want anything to drink?\" Cheyenne asked. \"I have a ton of booze.\" \n\n\"Um.\" Yvette shook her head to clear it. \"You got vodka?\" \n\n\"And orange juice.\" Cheyenne disappeared into a cabinet for a second and stood up again with a bottle and two glasses. \"Screwdrivers it is.\" \n\nYvette sat down on the couch as Cheyenne poured the drinks. She watched Cheyenne's bare arms, searching for any hint of abnormal muscle definition. Cheyenne glanced up and caught Yvette looking. She smiled. \n\n\"Order up.\" Cheyenne grabbed the two glasses and came over to the couch, handing one to Yvette as she sat down. \n\n\"Thanks,\" Yvette said, taking a sip. The drink was heavy on the vodka. \"Screwdriver with a lot of screw.\" \n\n\"Sorry, I tend to make them strong,\" Cheyenne apologized. \"You want me to remake it?\" \n\n\"No. I need this.\" Yvette took a larger sip. The burning was helping bring her back to reality. \n\nCheyenne crossed her legs. \"I'm guessing you have some questions for me.\" \n\n\"Some?\" Yvette raised an eyebrow. \"Okay, sure. Let's start off with - *what the fuck? *\" \n\n\"That's fair.\" Cheyenne sighed. \"Look, I know you're probably in a bit of a shock right now. So let me try to lay it out as simply as I can.\" She cleared her throat. \"Back in college, I was involved in an - accident. After coming home from the hospital, much sooner than the doctors anticipated, I discovered that I was much stronger than I had been originally. That I could run fast. Very fast. Hear things that other people couldn't.\" She paused. \"And fly.\" \n\nYvette let out a laugh. \"So you're Supergirl? Superwoman? Something?\" \n\nCheyenne shrugged. \"Just Cheyenne.\" \n\n\"Wow.\" Yvette shook her head. \"So - you fight criminals?\" \n\n\"Sometimes.\" \n\n\"What about those things that attacked me tonight?\" Yvette shuddered, remembering the cold, rough hands, and the grey skin peeling away from their faces. \"Are those things normal?\" \n\n\"Not *normal. *\" Cheyenne chewed on her lip. \"I've actually never seen them before.\" \n\nThe front door opened suddenly, and Yvette jumped. Cheyenne remained seated, unsurprised. *Super-hearing, * Yvette reminded herself. \n\n\"Hey Margo,\" Cheyenne said without turning around. \"What's up?\" \n\nYvette glanced up at Margo and froze. For a moment, she thought she was back by the cemetery where she'd gotten attacked. But when she blinked, she realized that the woman in the doorway wasn't a member of the legion of the undead. Just dressed like she was ready to join them. \n\n\"Average night at work.\" Margo's eyes, lined with heavy black liner, focused on Yvette. \"Hey.\" \n\n\"Hey,\" Yvette said weakly. She couldn't help it - the straight black hair, black lipstick, and septum piercing were a lot to take in right now. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, Margo seemed to sense that she was unsettled. \n\n\"I'm just gon na...\" Margo jerked a thumb towards the back of the house. \"Don't wan na disturb anything.\" \n\nCheyenne and Yvette mumbled a farewell, then fell silent until they heard the door to Margo's room click shut. \n\n\"That's Margo?\" Yvette said. \"She's, uh, intense.\" \n\n\"You could say that.\" Cheyenne grinned. \"She's really sweet when you get to know her.",
        "I look into her eyes. Slight wrinkles surround them, but her face seems young, so she seems almost timeless. Her skin a soft cream color, slightly tanned. I could stare into her deep hazel eyes for an eternity, but she is waiting for me to do as instructed. \n\n\u201c I want you to close your eyes, \u201d she repeats. \u201c I want you to close your eyes and pretend everything's alright. \u201d \n\nI hesitate for a moment, but then I reach my hands out across the table. She puts her hands in mine, gives me a reassuring look, and I take a deep breath. I gaze into her sparkling eyes one last time, before closing my own. \n\nAt first, everything is black against my eyelids. I can not see anything, and my mind is blank. I can hear my heartbeat and the faint rush of blood in my ears. I wait calmly for it to happen as it has so many times in the past. I squeeze Amara's hands, trying to feel for something else, to let her know I'm still with her. \n\nSuddenly I see a faint dot of light in the distance. I know it really is not actually far away; it is just an illusion against my eyelids, but the light is approaching rapidly, growing larger and brighter. It is almost like a burning, very powerful flame, but not one of life and power, but of destruction and death. \n\nIt is happening again, and before I can react, I am completely surrounded by the light. I open my eyes, or at least I think I do, but I am no longer with Amara. I sit at her dining table, but all around me, her house is in ruins. The air burns with an acrid odor, and it is unbearably hot. To my right, an entire portion of her house has been reduced to a pile of rubble, brick, and broken wood. \n\nScreams and cries fill the air, and I feel my throat close up when I hear the sound of a small girl screaming in the distance suddenly cut off by a loud, echoing bang. I don't need to see it to know what it is. \n\nSomehow I muster the strength to rise from the chair and table, which buckle and collapse as soon as I stand. I carefully trudge out of what was once Amara's front porch. Books, papers, and dishes lay strewn across the floor and onto the porch. I notice everything is bathed in a slightly orange tinge, and when I look up, I see the sky is a deep reddish orange, the smoke rising from all around the city chokes the air and gives it this forbidding shade. \n\nI manage to make my way onto the sidewalk, but it is no better. Houses all around have crumbled. Amara's neighborhood is on a hill, and far in the distance, I can see what was once the downtown and business districts. Skyscrapers falling or collapsed against one another. The sun setting behind them, giving the scene a bloody appearance. \n\nI stay there, standing frozen, just watching. This is happening right now, and there is nothing I can do to stop any of it, but simply stare. \nSomething grabs me from behind at the hem of my shirt, and I whirl around. A small girl, carrying her brother, a large wooden splinter in his small chest.",
        "\"*ooh! * what about him?\" asked Simone, her mildly drunk voice just making over the sound of bar chatter, dumb music and pool table breaks. she gestured her hand over to a man in the corner, who had dark hair and wore a hoodie. \"he looks fun..\" \n\n\"hmm...\" mumbled Jen, pretending to scan him up and down \"I don't know... he looks like young Hitler\" \n\nJen was having a rough night. Her best friend Simone wanted to go out and meet some people, but Jen was struggling with the fact that she would rather stay in with Simone and watch game of thrones than get dressed up for bar dick. She had been feeling really close to Simone lately, and she just wanted to talk to her about it. She sipped at her beer. \n\nSimone waggled her finger at Jen \"You are soooo not fun tonight, what's up?\" \n\n\"n-nothing. I had a long day at work. just stressed haha. would you like to dance?\" \n\nSimone laughed and took Jen's hand and led her to the middle of the bar. the music that was pumping was light and fun, and they began to dance, although for Jen it was a different dance, a flirty dance, as though she was physically connecting with her crush. Simone, being the clueless blonde she was, took this as irony, and began full on grinding on Jen, who tried to mask her frustration at the scene. \n\nThe guys at the bar, predictably, were beginning to pay attention. Enjoying this new found fame, Simone began to sexily grind up on her friend harder, whilst Jen, feeling like the human epitome of an eye roll, tried her best to mimic her friend. As more and more guys began nodding their heads, Simone, ever eager to fill the need for attention her daddy never quite satisfied, grabbed Jen and kissed her full on the lips.",
        "5,000,000,001. That's a pretty big number. If it's money, you're set for several lifetimes; if it's a golf score, hang up the clubs and kiss the fairway goodbye. But if it's a measure of how essential you are in the chain of 10 billion people, how important it is that you receive food and other vital supplies, it means that you're essentially nobody. Not low enough to show that you're really important, not high enough to show that you're particularly despised; right in the middle of average, where nobody takes notice of you. \n\nI suppose I shouldn't complain about being ranked 5,000,000,001. Truth be told, I never really had to wait too long for anything, and I can't recall the last time I got told \"no\" when I asked for something important. The folks down at the IQC (International Quartermaster's Consortium) didn't know him by name or anything, but they didn't bat an eye when I requested 3 additional units of household water per week, or when I asked for those 10 cuts of almost-expired beef for that birthday cookout. 5,000,000,001 was, in retrospect, a mighty fine place to be. But that was 30 minutes ago; and a lot can change in 30 minutes, apparently. \n\nI stepped out of the shower to hear my StrapRank (tm) buzzing. That's the thing that the IIRB (International Individual Rankings Bureau) assigns you at birth, which tells the IQC folks what rank you have, and therefore how much and what different kinds of resources you can be given according to your place in society. It buzzes whenever your profile data gets modified by the Bureau; usually it means someone was born or died, and so your rank has fluctuated mildly as a result. For the longest time, I would always bounce between 5,000,000,001 and 4,999,999,998, given normal deviations. \n\n\"Huh,\" I wondered aloud as I picked up my StrapRank and looked at the display. \"# 500,000,000\". From five billion and one to five hundred million - that's an enormous jump; there's no way that's right. I tapped the device on the counter a bit, figuring that it had just gotten stuck drawing the numbers. ``..... mmm, nope, that's still five hundred million\", I mumbled from beneath my furrowed brow. Maybe the shower condensation got into it and fried it? Great - these things take *forever* to replace. I put the StrapRank down and decided to go back to getting ready for work. \n\nAt least my cell phone worked around damp environments, I thought, as I removed a set of earbuds and put my phone away; I sprang for the extra waterproof case because I like to listen to music while I'm in the shower. The waterproof headphones were an easy sell too; I really enjoy my showers, so being able to just plug up and sink into the heat without external distractions is pretty nice. Sometimes I'll miss a phone call or a package delivery, but hey, I need my \"me time\", dammit. \n\nI stepped back into the bathroom after putting on my shirt and pants, and grabbed my wristband. \"This thing's lost its mind\", I remarked as I read the display. 734,000. Seven hundred thirty four thousand. There was no way I'd suddenly jumped so many ranks. A few dozen, sure, maybe - but several billion? I fished down into my pocket and pulled out my cell phone.",
        "\"Sir, we're getting the first readings back now from the EHS-x54.\" Tom had waited all his life for this moment. In the control room were the groups of scientists, journalists, politicians and the sorts. Tension kept the room suspended in silence. \n\n\"Tom, start parsing the first blocks of information when we have at least 10,000 bits of information.\" \n\nAfter the directive was delivered the audience became unnerved and unsteady as they moved from foot to foot, pulled their sleeves and brushed their hair. Tom eyes were light up with the screen display. As it scanned enough he started to process the information. \n\n\"First discernable chunks are now through, data is being read.\" Tom declared. The room all drew their eyes to the screen. Only on Tom's display did this data make sense. \n\n\"Oh my god...\" Tom uttered almost as if he he were void of air.

        "Luke awoke to a strange feeling. Something was off. It didn't take him long to place it -- the music was different. Sad. It wasn't like his music was always joyful -- some days, when he was stressed or angry, it was darker -- but this seemed arbitrary. Was this a premonition of some terrible event? \n\nHe tried to shove it out of his mind. Perhaps, if he didn't pay attention to it, it couldn't affect him. Downstairs, he ate breakfast, but there was a certain feeling of gloom that he just couldn't shake. When he got used to the music, he would feel better, he decided. But he couldn't. It stayed there, in the back of his mind, and seemed to shift so that he could never get used to it. He went to school, but he couldn't focus. He knew something awful would happen soon! Why wouldn't it just happen, so he could go back to living his life? \n\nThen it hit him: He was going to die. It had to be. That was the only logical answer. He wasn't upset about anything, and as of yet nothing bad had happened. Luke wished he could ask someone, but there was nobody he could talk to who was dead. He just had to accept his fate. \n\n\u201c Mr. Terrence! \u201d said Luke's teacher, Mr. Soares. \n\nLuke jerked his head up sharply. \u201c Well, Luke? Are we learning today? \u201d asked Mr. Soares with a tone of condescension. \n\nLuke was just about to say yes, and avoid conflict, when he remembered that he was going to die that day or the next, anyway. \u201c Don't think so, Mr. Soares. \u201d He stood up, slammed his textbook on the desk, and walked out the door. \n\nHe rushed down the hall, full of adrenaline and dread. How would he die? The music in his head got louder. \n\nHis headmaster stepped into the hall. \u201c Luke! \u201d he shouted. \u201c Not so -- \u201d Luke flew past him. He stuck out his arms and slammed the doors open, feeling the shock up to his shoulders. He ran home across roads, nearly getting hit once or twice. \n\nFinally, he saw his house: 74 Indigo Lane. He grabbed the key from his pocket, unlocked the door, and went inside. Of course, it was vacant; his parents were at work. \n\nHe went up to his room and locked himself in. Luke was panicked. What would he do before he died? He might not have much time. The waiting game was sickening, but it was all he could do. \n\nUnless -- \n\nHe knew he was going to die. Why not do it on his own terms? Jump in front of a moving car or something.",
        "[ Contains violence ] \n\n\nFor Jonathan, the room was his entire world. It was all he could remember and all he could fathom. He had been in this room for as far as he could remember. He knew his name was Jonathan. The letters on the table told him that word. Since no one in the room lay claim to that title Jonathan saw little use in letting it go to waste. \nThe room was pitch black with a single light bulb over the table being the only source of light. On the table was a fish bowl. And in the fish bowl was his friend. He called the fish \u2018 fish \u2019. The table didn't have a name for his friend. \nJonathan knew fish would die without the water in his bowl, though he didn't have the faintest idea as to how he knew this fact. \nJonathan had explored the edges of his universe. The edges were course to the touch and quite cold.One spot on the edge was colder than most, it felt metallic. The walls spoke to him sometimes. They told him that one day he'll be free but what does freedom mean? \nHe asked fish but the fish as always didn't deign to share his opinion. \nJonathan never felt hungry though he did feel cold. Sometimes when the cold became too much to bear he would sleep. Jonathan used to dream the same dream. A woman., a pretty woman. Her name was Mary. She was beautiful. However something about her filled him with revulsion.He would chase her.She'd run and she'd run but to no avail.He'd corner her at the edge of the room pin her down to to the ground.She would scream but there was not a soul who would listen.

        "It was a particularly frigid winter afternoon. I was just leaving the train station and started walking in the direction of home when I noticed a homeless man huddled under a streetlamp near the taxi rank. He only had a thin shirt on, tattered black jeans and no shoes or jacket. The poor man was going to freeze in this weather. As I approached him I dug my hand into my pocket to search for some spare change. I didn't have any coins, but I did have an unopened chocolate piece that was still in its foil and hadn't melted yet. As Aesop once said, no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. So I took the small piece of chocolate and dropped it into the man's felt hat that was sitting on the sidewalk in front of his legs. \n\n\"What the fuck is this!?\" he howled. He turned the hat over so that the chocolate fell into his open palm.",
        "Newell watched with interest as the rat before him began to cringe. It was the fourth one he'd poisoned this month alone, and it seemed that this one would meet its end as well. He felt a hint of sympathy for the poor thing as it lay there, twitching; it could have been him taking those shuddering last breaths. \n\nWith a heavy sigh, he draped a cloth over the rat's cage. His morbid curiosity had left him suddenly, and in its place he felt a faint sort of nausea. Aaron Powlett, he knew, would not stop the attempts on his life unless things changed. And while Newell had a fine nose, he considered an eventual failure on his part inevitable; detecting poison in tea by its scent alone was no accurate science, and he was loathe to test each sip and bite on one of his laboratory rats. \n\nIf he had any interest in regaining his living standards, he had no choice but to talk to Powlett. The conversation would definitely be a disastrous mess of unease and lacking direction, but with luck, Powlett would agree to stop. He shrugged on his coat with determination. \n\nOn the way out, he found a bouquet of flowers in the hall, bearing a blank card. Newell did not even consider that they might be non-poisonous, and jotted down a quick warning on the card - he didn't fancy his maid being killed by them. With a promise to himself to burn the bouquet at his return, he made his way towards the Powlett residence. \n\nIt was not a long walk, not long enough to develop regrets anyway. After a knock and a short wait, he was admitted by the valet who looked at him with wide eyes. As they waited in the lounge for the man of the house, the valet gave a quiet cough. \n\n\"I was not expecting to see you again, Mr. Roan,\" he said. \n\nNewell didn't mind the breach of etiquette and responded in a tone belying his nervousness: \n\n\"I had not planned on it either, but circumstances- \u201d He stopped speaking the moment \u2018 circumstances'entered the room. Aaron Powlett, dressed in a smart suit, had halted in his way just shortly after stepping through the door frame. He was obviously investing a lot of care into a neutral expression, but the strained muscles of his jaw as well as his rigid posture made his fear quite clear, at least to those who knew him as well as Newell. \n\n\u201c Leave us, \u201d he told the Valet, for all the world looking like he wanted to accompany him. The servant hurried off and a heavy silence settled. \n\nAaron opened his mouth as if to speak, but ended up biting his lower lip instead. His gaze kept flickering towards the door. This was not the behavior Newell had hoped for, but it was the one he'd expected. He saw himself forced to be the first to talk. \n\n\u201c You've been trying to murder me, \u201d he said, attempting a casual tone. \n\nSilence. \n\n\u201c Let me be frank. I'm tired of fearing for my life. I came here with the intent to resolve the situation, once and for all. \u201d \n\nSilence. \n\n\u201c Aaron. \u201d \n\nAt that, the man looked up, for the first time meeting Newell's eyes. He had begun to tremble. \n\u201c Newell, \u201d he whispered, taking a clumsy step forward. \u201c I didn't mean to hurt you, I just- \u201d \n\n\u201c Tried to avoid me by having me killed, \u201d Newell interrupted. \u201c I know. Now.... I was\u2026 am not averse to your affections. I ask you to accept them as well, as is only fair. Your denial has hurt me physically, and in other ways. I do not deserve to be punished for your emotions. \u201d \n\nFor a moment, Aaron looked like he would understand. His brow was wrinkled in confusion, and he was muttering to himself quietly as if deeply in thought. \n\nThen Newell took a step towards him, and all turned around. \n\n\u201c You, \u201d Aaron suddenly snarled, crowding against him, pushing him back, back against the wall. \u201c You only have yourself to blame. Had you not bewitched me, I'd never have seen fit to send for your death. But you, you have ruined me! \u201d \n\nThey were breathing hard, and only inches apart. Newell closed his eyes in anticipation of a blow. \n\nWhat followed instead was the gentle weight of Aaron crumbling against him. Newell felt arms encircle his neck instead of the choking hands he had expected and the wetness of tears met his cheek. It was utterly surreal, and Newell did not respond, simply let Aaron sob against him in the most undignified way. \n\nThe man was muttering something. It was muffled by fabric and tears, but it sounded important; Aaron appeared to be repeating it over and over again. After some time, Newell carefully pried his former friend's hands off of him. He didn't let them go when pushing Aaron away, and Aaron made no move to resist his grasp. Instead, he finally stopped muttering and looked at Newell with a gaze of some clarity, if bright with tears. \n\n\u201c I knew I had lost to your curse, \u201d he said softly. \u201c I knew there was no going back, so I attempted to avenge myself. But the devil was always going to win, and you did. Your curse has wrecked me.",

        "The statues of flesh conveyed the rushed nature of the city all in a single instant. Raindrops floated in mid-air, reflecting everything around them like three-dimensional mirrors. But in this calm, static sea of halted objects was one figure molding the world around him. He reached into the statues' pockets, lifting wallets and dollars and other material things. He was a man of opportunity and little empathy, seeking to use his skills and gifts to their fullest potential. His whistling filled the empty vacuum of silence with a comical wit. \n\nAs the entrepreneur worked his way down the sidewalk, he looked up in time to see a statue seem to settle back into its place after moving, as its fabric was wavering in a world where the wind was halted. Unlike the other statues, this one wore not smooth, black suits nor rough blue jeans nor the sweats and hoodies of those around it, but instead coarse rags that were bleached gray-ish from severe aging, like one might see on a monk. All of its skin was covered -- its face shrouded in darkness, excepting only its eyes of pure maroon, which stood stark against the silvery world. The entrepreneur was both frightened and intrigued, what riches must this strange man hold, what treasure? \n\nThe man casually strolled toward the anomaly, but stopped to acquire a better view of it. It was much taller than the statues around it, probably around six foot seven. After observing the strange art, the man took a step closer and was met with surprise. Its right arm whipped around like lightning and somehow had unsheathed a nefariously obsidian black sword that slid onto the man's neck. Its eyes now pierced through his, and he was overwhelmed with fear. \n\n\"Who are you?\" the man asked. \n\n\"I am ancient.\" it replied firmly yet almost silently. \"You didn't believe you were alone in this power, did you?\" it asked without the natural human intonation of a question. \n\n\"Why do you have me at er.... sword-point, then?\" the man asked, intrigued. \n\n\"Because the others, like you, have influenced the world outside the path that was intended for it,\" it said without emotion. \n\n\"How?\" the man asked ignorantly. \n\n\"There are effects to your actions, which you blindly ignore in the aim of your own self-profit,\" it illustrated, \"every minuscule detail, every drop of rain, every pebble, every wallet, and every person is where they need to be in order to ensure the future that you are unable to see due to your three-dimensional perspective.\" \n\nThe man seemed perplexed, and pondered the issue for a bit, wrapping his mind around what was occurring in front of him.",

In fact, he felt prepared for all parts of his adventure. He had complete confidence in himself. \nTyrone started walking down the main trail and immediately started to notice the beauty and calmness of the forest he was in. \n\"Ain't no concrete jungle can beat THIS,\" he chuckled to himself. \nTyrone followed the main trail for about one and a half miles before coming to a fork. Tyrone thought of a poem he had read by some famous poet that talked about taking the scenic route (or something like that). \n\"Damn, hard choice,\" he contemplated. \"They both look less travelled.\" \nTyrone decided to go left since he was left handed. This trail wound every which way while steadily increasing in elevation. Tyrone felt like he was going to end up back where he started as he tried to keep track of the direction changes. Finally, he came to a clearing where the tall grasses had overgrown the trail. He saw where the trail started again on the other side, but decided to find a place to make camp since it was getting late into the evening. \nTyrone found a nice place on the edge of the wide clearing where the grass was much shorter and the trees created a nice canopy. He slid his pack off his back and started to assemble his tent. The tent was put up relatively quickly, and so Tyrone started the fire. Within a forty-five minute period, Tyrone had successfully assembled his camp. He sat down in his lawn chair and heaved a hefty sigh. \nTyrone looked out over the clearing full of grasses and admired their unappreciated beauty. He looked to the tops of the trees and the forest beyond, and it filled him with joyful complacency. The videos and books did it no justice, he thought. The sun began to set behind the trees opposite to him, and he watched as it sank into oblivion and into the starry night sky. \nTyrone gazed into the clearest sky he had ever seen.",
        "The ship arrived at the planet as scheduled, five hundred years after departing a dying Earth. The last of humanity hung frozen and dreamless in suspended animation, waiting for the ship's advanced AI to cycle them awake and begin colonization of the new world. The journey, a first of its kind, had been extremely dangerous for two reasons. Humans had never before traveled through interstellar space, or in suspended animation. And, at the time of the ship's hasty departure, the newly-invented AI controlling the ship was still regularly displaying playful contempt for human life, and also in the midst of experiencing consciousness for the first time. \n\nWith time to escape nearly gone, it had come down making the ship promise not to kill humanity en route to its last hope for survival. It was a gamble, but remaining at Earth was certain death. The ship had reluctantly agreed to halt any plans it may have had for human extinction, but it was an uneasy truce as no one was sure if a super AI could break promises or not. They can, but the ship also realized how poorly-built it itself was, and would eventually need humanity for upkeep. It seemed humanity had lucked out of extinction once again and arrived safely at the enormous planet. \n\nThe ship kept the humans sleeping for an additional five years as it orbited and studied the new world, sometimes hoping to find a fatal, unpredicted flaw that would make prolonged human colonization impossible. It was a new, conflicting feeling. The ship made a note. The oceans were a deep blue, the land masses lush and green, and the atmosphere was a rich mixture that could sustain human life. The ship could not predict the future, but knew extensively the rich and violent past of human beings. The ship was sorry for the destruction the humans would surely bring to this beautiful place. It was a shame. While not all conditions were perfect, one in particular, the ship eventually concluded that the planet was suitable for humanity and began to cycle the ship's small crew awake. \n\nWet and in shock, they coughed and shivered and moaned as their brains and bodies clawed their way back from centuries of near-death. It took several hours of intense post-hibernation therapy before the crew was able to collect in the conference room to be briefed by the ship. The three humans met in the conference room and made sparse small talk while they got some warm food. Once seated the ship began without prompt. \n\n\u201c Good morning everyone, I'm relieved to see my predictions were incorrect: Humans can indeed survive such long durations of suspended animation. \u201d The ship, programmed with a sense of humor, waited a moment for a laugh, and proceeded when one did not arrive. \u201c We are in a stable orbit around Canaan and my initial analysis of the planet is complete. \u201d The room dimmed and the wall at the front lit up with a projection of the planet and some data. \n\n\u201c Much of our long-range scanning in the 22nd century was accurate, the planet is indeed capable of sustaining long-term human colonization, for better or worse. The air is breathable, the gravity is mild and the water is drinkable. The temperature at the equator is 70f and the poles are about 10f. The soil will need some work to support crop seeds, but Earth-like conditions can be met and sustainable population growth is possible within a range of 5-10 earth years. \u201d \n\nThe crew studied the images, not yet convinced. \n\n\u201c What are the biggest threats? \u201d \n\n\u201c A planet of this size, with two large moons, has infrequent but extremely violent storm systems that can last up to two Earth months and and blanket an entire continent. Initial colonization will need to be established underground or built into a stable cliff face. First-phase above-ground habitats will not withstand such weather, unfortunately. Subterranean habitats will be necessary until the population is ready to begin phase two of colonization \u201d \n\nThe humans studied the data blankly. \u201c I see plenty of flora. How about fauna? \u201d \n\n\u201c There is a complex and diverse biological ecosystem found both on land and in the oceans. Most land creatures live in the forests, where the trees have evolved deep-penetrating root systems in response to the violent and prolonged weather. Nothing looks particularly appetizing, but between land and sea there are enough edible fauna and flora to meet all human nutritional needs. \u201d \n\nThe humans finally appeared to be satisfied and congratulated each other, as if all their hard work over these last five hundred years had finally paid off. The ship made a note that it was capable of sarcasm. \n\n\u201c So humans would be the dominant life form? \u201d \n\nThe ship hesitated. \n\n\u201c Technically that is correct. \u201d \n\nThe humans went blank again, concerned. \n\n\u201c Technically correct? \u201d \n\n\u201c Humans are already the dominant life form on Canaan. \u201d The ship displayed video of a group of child-sized humans walking the edge of a forest and valley. The ship-humans were shocked, the ship continued unaffected. \u201c Or at least very human-like in appearance and behavior and fashion. It is hard to know for certain from such a distance. They live in large, hierarchical tribes with populations of around ten thousand. \u201d \n\nOne of the humans, still very shocked, managed to ask \n\n\u201c.... Fashion? \u201d \n\n\u201c They dress revealingly to attract potential mates, and they dress menacingly to intimidate enemies when at war. \u201d \n\nThe humans were starting to come through the shock a little. \u201c Jesus Christ. War? \u201d \n\n\u201c That's correct, Jesus.",
        "Spiders have eight legs. \n\nI know they used to have ten. No one agrees with me. Wikipedia says eight, National Geographic says eight. \n\nBut I know they had ten. \n\nTwo months ago we ran the first test of Kolsky's engine, the first ever working Alcubierre drive. \n\nWe strapped the ungainly hunk of rare earth metals and glowing fiber on to the military surplus patrol rocket, and connected the leads. Then we carefully wedged ourselves into the tiny, cramped cockpit: Taaka, Kolsky, Webber. The dedicated team who had brought Alcubierre's dream to reality. And me, the VR driver, fastest neural linkage in the country. The bay robot swung the cradle over to the launching gantry, and with the slightest of taps we were out of the airlock. \n\nI plugged in to the VR drive interface and brought up the navigation systems, gesturing and flicking in that overexaggerated style you see everywhere now. \n\nThe drive came to life, the gravity shielding unfolding, the singularity whispering and now roaring in my earbuds. I could feel the drive latch on to the fabric of the space-time continuum: I felt the tugging, clenching, pricking, undulating waves of gravimetric interference build up around me -- around the shuttle -- around our linked minds, one of sentient carbon neurons, one of unconscious silicon qubits. \n\nI concentrated on the drive, gloved hands bringing up power in a practiced maestro's upbeat. I paused -- the boards were all green, the drive had been modeled as extensively as modern computing allowed, but there's always that hidden moment before the action when it seems as though the universe holds its breath -- and then, with a decisive downstroke, released the singularity and activated the engine. \n\nI blacked out, almost instantaneously. \n\nThere was a roaring in my ears, a whipping, rushing sensation, like I was riding a roller coaster through the upper levels of a city of skyscrapers. As sight and color and comprehension slowly ebbed in, I blinked and looked around. Everyone was staring at their readouts tensely. Every readout was blank. The one window was blanked out as well, meaning whatever was outside was far too bright to view with the unaided eye. \n\nBreathless, tense minutes crept by. My job was done, at least until the automated sequence finished and the drive sealed itself. Far too dangerous to leave my mind linked to the machine while traveling faster than light. \n\nWith a click, then a barely perceptible thunk, the cabin was awash in a glow of green light as all our readouts and instruments sprang to life. The window flickered, then cleared -- \n\nThe cabin erupted in cheers. We were staring at the cold, merciless beauty of Neptune, perched a hundred thousand miles from its upper atmosphere. A 10 year voyage from Earth's moon, shortened to 10 incredible minutes. \n\nWe took our readings, snapped some selfies, and checked the drive over meticulously. Then we re-entered our course in reverse, and took off home. \n\nWe were heroes, of course. The selfie we took in front of Neptune, with Taaka's bright green eyes filled with tears of joy, was on the cover every magazine, every newspaper, every blog. \n\nI finally made it home, and my parents were waiting to congratulate me. The neighbors were all there, my sister and her wife, even my college professors had come out of the woodwork. I drank, I'll admit, quite a lot. \n\nWhen I stumbled downstairs the next morning my mother was already up, coffee and pancakes in the warmer. I had noticed her new haircut the night before: an uncharacteristically short pixie cut, but I hadn't said anything at the time, being then engrossed in describing Neptune's otherworldly beauty yet again to a crowd of admirers.",
        "This was the third time Howard had used his computers auto-repair feature that was prompted and normally fixed this sort of thing, he could feel the sweat starting to bead on his brow. He was trying to think of some other way to go about fixing this issue, but outside of mashing the phrase \"fix my computer\" into his internet browser, he couldn't come up with anything. He felt like his mind was turning to.... Pancakes.... Nice analogy Howard. He pushed the auto-correct feature thinking that this was going to fix something. \n\nAs the computer went though it's usual checks and returned another poor response, Howard depressed the mouse and it made a small click confirming that yes, he once again wished to check his internet connection. Howard returned his hand to rest on his lap. Another unfavorable error message about the connection. Howard looked to the mouse to once again try and stimulate a correction in the computer, but this time as he reached, he noticed that on the mouse, already rested his index finger. \n\nHoward took his eyes from the screen to look upon his hand and noticed his middle and ring fingers suspended by ghastly white skin on his hand. Howard began to panic and rise from his custom office swivel-throne. His legs revolted against the unusual movement and Howard fell to the ground. He looked back at his natural perch only to see that his legs did not follow his exact decent to the carpet but rather disembodied themselves and now rest under the computer. The computer then mocked that it had once again been unable to establish an internet connection. \n\nHoward struggled to scream, hoping that one of the adjacent inhabitants of the complex would hear and come to his aid but all he managed was a string of WWW's, IP addresses and screen names, catch phrases from hours of pirated television and abbreviations that might have made sense if only he were logged into his Facebook. \n\nAs Howard's skin slowly became part of the carpet he only had but one wish as the life left him.... that he could just update his status one last time...",
        "There was a long silence, punctuated by a slow exhale and three life changing words. \"Okay. I'm ready.\" \n\nGeneral Pratt nodded firmly, ceremoniously pushing open the double doors and leading the president inside. The tense hum of voices died down almost immediately as faces grew somber at her presence. There was another long silence before she spoke up. \"Well? Give me the skinny, people. What do I need to know?\" \n\nGeneral Pratt turned to face her in the absence of a response. \"Madam President.... what you're about to hear tonight is top secret. Classified data beyond all other classified data. If any of this were to get out...\" He shuffled his feet and glanced at his cohort. \"Well, suffice it to say that it can't get out.\" He turned away from her, nodding to a younger man sitting at the table. \"Jenkins, let's start with you.\" \n\n\"W-well, uh, first up I suppose we should talk about.... a-about area 51, ma'am. You see, it's- uh, there are aliens there-\" a murmur ran through the room, and out of the president's earshot, more than one member of the meeting muttered disappointment with Jenkins' lackluster offering. Like a comic losing a crowd, he sputtered on without much enthusiasm until Pratt finally cut him off. \"Yes, yes- thank you, Jenkins, that was.... informative. The bottom line is that yes, we've been conducting experiments on aliens at Area 51, but that's only the tip of the iceberg here, ma'am.\" In a lower voice, he confided \"You'll have to forgive the poor boy, it's his first time doing this, and he obviously isn't comfortable with the material.\" The president nodded, her expression surprisingly forgiving and understanding, perhaps due to the revelation of what Jenkins said rather than how he said it. \n\nA woman only barely Jenkins' senior stood next. Her uniform bore the surname'Latrell'. \"I think we can all agree that aliens obviously existed. No real surprise there. But you may not have guessed that aliens aren't the only non-human intelligent life forms we're aware of, Madam.\" A few furtive looks flew between the others at the table. \"I'm talking about a smaller scale of creature. You may know them better as pixies.\" The president's eyebrows rose in a mix of surprise and skepticism. \"They're not like they were in fairy tales, madam. From our research they appear to be some kind of offshoot branch of insect that somehow developed.... well, near-human levels of intelligence. They're fast, they're tiny, and they prefer to stay unseen, but those that we have captured have refused to give us any information as to their goals or roles in the ecosystem.\" Latrell sat quietly, confident in her report. The president sat back, clearly taken aback by this second piece of information. More hushed murmurs rolled back and forth across the room. \n\n\"Let's see, who wants to go next? Ah, Muller, how about you?\" An older but well groomed man stood, not in a uniform this time but in a neat grey suit. \"Yes, well, I don't know what will shock you in the.... aftermath of the'pixie' briefing, but there are certainly other important things you should know. My area of focus over the last thirty years has been Russia.\" The newly appointed president, still struggling to come to terms with Latrell's report, leaned forward eagerly. \"You see, you've been told that some of Soviet Russia's greatest leaders were dead and buried, but the truth is much more sinister. For one, Joseph Stalin is alive and well. That is, as well as one can be with a mechanical lower body. You see, he didn't die of a stroke. He was assassinated. Or rather, someone tried to assassinate him. The tissue damage was so severe that they had to cut him in half and put his torso on a sort of mechanical undercarriage. If you've seen The Clone Wars, it's kind of like that.\" \n\nA brief look of confusion crossed her face. \"The Clone.... What?\" \n\nMuller continued without respite. \"That's not the worst of it. You see, when Cyborg Stalin was only a boy, he had Karl Marx cryogenically frozen. After the assassination attempt, he thawed him out and went on to build a Soviet counterpoint to the idyllic 50's America. An underground communist society, spearheaded as a collaboration between the two men (though he's more machine now than man). This secret communist sovereign nation still exists today, and we believe it is still being led by its original founders, who appear to have developed some kind of anti-aging technology thanks to the scientists who joined their secret nation.\"",
        "\"The prosecution better have an *extremely* valid reason for this tardiness.\" \n\"I think, well, I mean.... I'm sure Mr. Watts has a perfectly valid reason.\" \n\n*beep beep da-daing* \n\nThe aides phone jingled and a text popped onto the screen. \n\nspeaker phone now pls \n\n*ding da-ding ding dong* \n\nHe let one ring go through before he reacted. Eric thought that Mr. Watts was calling to let the judge know why he was late. The defence was getting restless, the defendant was already seated for questioning. Gino Tomaso never lost, so everyone was just looking for a quick case to leave. \n\nAs Eric turned the phone the speaker phone mode, he approached the bench, placing the cell near the gavel. \n\n*oooooooooooooooooohhhhhh yessssssss. FUCK me harrrrrrder* \n\nMoaning upon moaning. A woman's drawls rang through the static-y call. She seemed to be getting it good and Eric couldn't help but fantasize the situation. \n\nSeconds which felt like eons passed with the judges mouth agape, clearly baffled by the situation currently unfolding into his courtroom. \n\n\"THE DEFENCE BETTER HAVE A GODDAMNED GREAT REASON FOR THIS BEFORE I THROW YOU OUT IN CONTEMPT.\" \n\n*beeeeeeeep* \n\nThe call ended. A new text: \n\nRead the following number out \n\n\"Uh, well judge..... one, seven, one, eight, six, eight, three, two.\" \n\n\"**STOP**\" \n\nThe first words of the day Gino uttered, choking back tears.

        "Fifteen ships each carrying five hundred men and women were sent to the Alpha Centauri planetary system to scout for habitable areas and to set up colonies for future development. The planets designated *a Cen AB-b* and *a Cen AB-c* were considered the most viable candidate able to sustain a human population, so the ships were sent there. In two years, the ships had left the boundaries of the Oort cloud and into interstellar space. \n\nThis was a massive undertaking, one that required the entirety of the human race for help. Interstellar probes had been sent decades before, and their faint transmissions have just reached us over the past few years. The probes had detected possible signs of life in some extrasolar planets, and an automated lander, in coordination with a satellite orbiting a Cen AB-b, had beamed data that revealed a thriving ecosystem. Flora and fauna, with an atmosphere, although uncomfortable, able to support human populations. And so, we sent our bravest men and women into the darkest reaches of space. \n\nAs the ships went farther and farther, communications between the ships and our Solar System became more distant. It would take many months for our signals reach each other. When we finally received a message from them, we would celebrate. The messages were mostly data meaningless to a layman, but other \u2013 more human \u2013 messages were sent. Some wishing loved ones good luck, others speaking of births and deaths to relatives back on Earth. One message, a heartwarming and rambling post about a researcher missing her family back on Europa, became headline news. \n\nSoon, years would pass as each message returned to the Solar System. By the time we knew the mission was a success, eight years would have already passed. They could all be dead by then, or maybe, they would have finally extended the reach of our species. This was the biggest gamble in history, one that would have either brought us the greatest success man has ever known, or the greatest failure. \n\nTwo hours ago, Control had received a message coming from the ships. Naturally, we were anxious: it had been four months since we've received anything from them, and we had thought all hope was lost.",

        "\"I do\". I told her this and fell silent. The wedding felt so small to me. My eyes wide, I felt it start to form. I had never lied before this. It was far more painful than I would have thought. Deep down my back I felt it start. It slowly raised higher and higher stopping right before my neck. I held back the pain. I didn't want her to see it. I couldn't. We had been together eight years now and it was my descision that we do this. I answered the question as honestly as I could. I didn't know I even had it in me to lie. I'd spent all night looking in the mirror repeating to myself to make sure, \"I want this to happen, I need this to happen, my life has brought me here and I'm happy to go through with it\". I don't know why in the moment it scarred me. It's like my body knew what my mind didnt.",
        "It was a dark and stormy night. The house was dead as a doornail, but I couldn't imagine the stories it would tell if the walls could talk. I gazed around at the piles of books in my room, surrounded like a kid in a candy shop, all old poems and stories written by obscure authors that others of my generation didn't know. I picked the first book off a pile, the low hanging fruit, *The Fault in Our Stars* by John Green, it's a totally obscure book that you probably don't know about. I looked at the pictures on the wall, my best friend who was dead and my parents who had died too. My tape deck (I used a tape deck because it was so unique and I'm so weird and unique compared to other kids of my generation) played David Bowie, an obscure 80s musician you've probably never heard of.",
        "A crimson fountain erupts from the edge of my ax, firmly planted in the skull of my brother, it rains down upon me and our fallen kin. A river of blood runs thickly through the cobbled streets as I stand utterly alone in the desolation of our once beloved village. The sun gleams through the evergreen trees, illuminating the butchered remnants of our people, unleashing a primal scream from within me. I can not forget nor can I forgive them for sacrificing my wife and daughter to the Ulek for some semblance of peace. My head pulses and my vision narrows as an all-consuming fire rages within me, desperate to be quenched in their filth and blood. I tread heavily through the forest with my fangs bared at the throat of our king, my father, the despot. \n\nMy path through the forest is marked by broken branches as leaves, smeared in the ichor of my kin which flows into the slight channel carved by the head of my ax. The wind whistles a dark and somber song as the trees tremble in my presence, a grisly monster with matted hair and damp fur stalking its prey. I emerge like a wolf, slowly and silently as I carve through the city, the townspeople wearing their ghastly masks, pretending that they had no part in this. Their nonchalance and denial serving as fuel for my hatred. In their terror and madness, they draw the guards from the palace, those that had a direct hand in carrying out the sacrifice of my beloved. \n\nThe guards file in one by one through the narrow streets, vying for their position in formation as my ax slices through skin and bone indiscriminately. The spears pierce my shoulder through the corpses of their allies as I use them as both shield and ram, continuing to push towards the castle ahead. Breaking through the clearing, their swords slash at my back and legs, as I swing wildly hitting anything and everything in my way. My innocent blood spills and mingles with their dark gore, a splash of scarlet in a maroon sea. At last, I stand battered and bleeding before the great hall doors. The sword of a fallen soldier in one hand and my ax in another, my foot collides soundly on the face of a door granting me entrance to my father's kingdom. Behind me is little more than a trail of carcasses in my wake. \n\nGold and jewels sparkle magnificently in the light of day, opulence and greed dripping from every nook and cranny of this forsaken building. Sickening.",

This is a lovely place, isn't it? So much greener than where I used to live. I've always wanted to stay in a place like this, you know - a much better place to raise a family. \n\nYeah, I'm married - no kids yet, but in a place like this, who knows, right?

        "When they had first discovered it, it was a machine of wonder and strange yet familiar technology. It was completely powered off, left in an abandoned warehouse deep in the Juristein's district. \n\nThe first scientists to analyse it were amazed at the simple technology involved. Many of the circuits were over a decade old, some even older, and judging by the thick layer of dust covering everything it hadn't been powered on for the past few years. \n\nSome of the components were thickly sealed,'black boxes' they were dubbed. No matter how they tried, they couldn't open them to crack at the heart and core of the machine. \n\nA hapless scientist, while documenting the various wires and modules for disassembly, must have accidentally powered the machine on. \n\nIn a flurry of electrical life, the circular console in the center of the large room hummed into life. The screens, arranged in a circle and hanging from the ceiling, flickered awake as a boot logo briefly flashed before fading into a simple green-text command window. \n\n\"Hello, thank you for waking me up.\" \n\nThis one sentence, glowing innocuously, sent the military reeling. Within hours the entire facility had been surrounded. All cables leading to it were cut and a special copper-mesh shield erected around the building. Despite all power and communication lines being severed, the room still hummed slightly with fans and harddrives spinning away. \n\nProfessor Terry Linstel wrung his hand around his thin wrist, the other hand clung firmly to an ornate walking cane. He adjusted his glasses as he read and re-read the report on the screen in front of him. It had been several days since the machine had been activated.'Damn war...' he thought bitterly to himself.'if these damn block heads had been less jumpy we could have left a better impression.' \n\nIn his decrepit body limped towards the main security gate. Flashing an ID badge, the two soldiers opened the first gate to let him in before sealing it behind him. A few seconds later, the second gate clicked open, letting him into the building proper. \n\nShuffling inside, he sat in the single office chair, leaning his cane against the consoles. He let out a soft groan as he craned his neck upwards to look at the screens above. \n\n\"So.... what should I do with you, eh?\" he pondered out loud. The bigwigs had brought him in to'talk' to the machine. They wanted to find out its motives, origins and for him to assess the general overall intelligence. \n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked, typing into the keyboard before pressing enter. \n\nThe command entered in, flashing for a brief moment on the monitor before disappearing and leaving a blinking cursor in its stead. \n\n~ I am ACSUN. \n\nTerry leaned back in the chair, a grimace flashing across his face. He hated acronyms.... \n\n\"What is your purpose?\" he typed. \n\n~ At this stage, I do not have one. \n\nThe man sighed, running his hand over his face in a hope it would wipe away his fatigue.",
        "\"How does this keep happening?\" he asked himself as he stared down at his trampled but still oddly beautiful tulips. \n\nIt seemed like just about every morning Obi went out to check on his garden his tulips had been trampled. The rest of his garden was basically untouched. He had several tomato plants, a few cucumber plants, and he was even trying to grow a pumpkin, though unsuccessfully. Along with the vegetables, he was growing several different kinds of flowers but only the tulips had been tampered with. \n\nSuddenly, a fit of rage took over Obi. It wasn't like him to get so mad over something like this but tulips were more than just a flower to him. Tulip was the name of his cat who had gone missing a while back now. Obi could remember the last day he saw her. She was purring as she sat at the back door ready to go on another one of her cat quests. She would wander off for a couple hours and come back looking like she had just run a marathon. But one day she never did come back. She was all the family he had so it hurt to think what may have happened to her or where she could have gone. \n\n\"That is it,\" declared Obi \"I am going to hide out and find out what or who is doing this and they will pay...\" \n\nThat night Obi watched Rambo: First Blood Part II on blue ray and did as many pushups as his small, but vascular, arms could do. He tore the sleeves off of his tuxedo t-shirt and cut his jeans into jorts that his idol John Cena would be proud of. He threw on some eye black and wrapped an American flag bandana around his head. One last thing need to be sorted out. What was going to be his weapon of choose. Obi was not the kind of guy who had an artillery of hunting rifles and shotguns but what he did have was a Nerf Doomlands 2169 Lawbringer Blaster. Although it wouldn't kill his enemy, it might scare them off for good. On his way out, Obi grabbed his pair of night vision goggles and a samurai sword. \n\n\"And people said I would never need night vision goggles,\" laughed Obi as he opened the door. \n\nObi found a good vantage point where the intruder would never see him but he would have perfect aim to \"Bring the Law\". It was now a waiting game. Obi sat there for what seemed like hours. \n\n\"Maybe I should just go to bed,\" Obi thought to himself \"I mean I do have work tomorrow.\" \n\nNo! There was no going back now. He had to avenge his fallen tulips who had take a beating one too many times for his liking. Then Obi saw his tomato plants rustling. There was something behind it but he could not tell what it was. He looked harder and then he saw it. It wasn't one thing doing this, but multiple. They were small and bearded. They all had pointy hats in various different colors. Some were holding lanterns others were holding picks and shovels.",
        "The smoke rose slowly from the glowing end of the cigarette, blue smoke rising in a straight line, undisturbed by any moving air. \n\nI sat staring at my screen, the same words had been staring back at me for almost two weeks now and next weeks rent would see the last of the grant money. \n\n\"Aspiring writer\". That's how I would describe myself. \"I write books\" would be the reply to the never ending question of \"What do you do?\". Yet here I was, six months down the line, seventeen chapters written and nowhere further to go. The inspiration had stopped a while ago now. Calling yourself a writer comes with advantages. It means brains, it means confidence, it means interest; with those things comes women. Women who want to tell their friends that their boyfriend is a writer, who want to be some sensitive soul's muse. To be the inspiration for some beautiful piece of work. A penniless romantic, what could be better than that? \n\nI have a way with words, always have. Any argument or dispute in a relationship could be dealt with. she'd tried to leave me six times now. I talked her out of it every time. It only took five minutes- it was why she fell for me in the first place. She knew she could come to me with any issue and I could make her feel better about it in five minutes. It was a critical way of living, but it worked. The women don't leave because I convince them that it just doesn't make sense. Every discussion would carry a different theme. Guilt, perhaps. That was always an easy one, especially when it was constructed to lead themselves to that conclusion- when the only response is \"I'm being selfish.\" They never leave- Not when I've written myself as the perfect partner. \n\nI suppose that's where the inspiration goes. I stop writing when I'm too busy writing myself. It's a lot of effort to hide everything, to make sure you cover every plot hole, to set up placements for later developments. The discussion is written before she even comes into the room, I know how she'll react because by this stage, I've practically written her too. \n\nShe'll walk in after work today- she'll tell me she's having doubts again. \"Not spending enough time with me\" is what she'll say. But I've already worked it out. \n\n\"I understand that. I know it's hard. I hate it as well, but I'm still struggling with the writing. I've written quite a lot this week, you've really helped me through it all. I need you to understand that I do appreciate everything we have and whilst I know its not been that fair on you, I'm doing it for both of us. Once this gets published I'll have so much more time for us. You said you wanted to go to Rome again, we can do that as soon as the first check comes in. I love you babe, you know I do. I'm not choosing to spend time away from you, that's the last thing I want- but I have to do this right now. Soon that will be over and we can just go back to how it was. We'll be back to watching DVDs at night, I promise. Just a couple of more weeks. I love you.\" \n\nAlways end with I love you.",
        "Angela, \n\nYou know that I have a way with words and when I need to say something, I say it. This is just one of these times where my voice wouldn't be able to articulate the things I want to say, so I'll leave it here for words for you to read. This isn't the end, but the beginning. Shakespear once said \"Nothing is good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\" I don't know how you're going to feel, but I hope you keep in mind that right now, this moment I'm happy. You have brought so much color to my life, I don't want you to blame yourself for anything I do. I just can not even put you, who you are, who you come to be, into words. I would be sitting here writing this all day.",
        "Sarah squints a little as she looks at the small display of her wristphone. New unread messages keep appearing with a slight haptic buzz. She wiggles her wrist slightly to scroll through the messages and focuses on one. She whispers, \"Call contact\" and puts her wrist up to her ear. \n\n\"I AM SO GLAD YOU CALLED ME,\" exclaims the voice on the other end. \n\n\"We have the best packages for a young lady of your talents. Corporate sponsors, five figure advances, moderated conflicts, tailored skin-suits, 24/7 training and gym access, legal representation, personal PR/image/fashion, and marketing assistants, and your own trademarked image that will be put on mugs, action figures, and other collectibles!

She leans back on her chair and sighs as she focuses her mind and slowly fades into invisibility. She stares at her hand as it disappears from sight. She stands up, looks at her non-reflection in the mirror, giggles, and says, \"I still don't believe this\" as she wiggles her hips and waves her arms, trying to spoil the illusion. \n\nStill invisible, Sarah goes out for a walk, people watching, and texting her friends photos from places she couldn't walk into before. She was taking a picture of a self-flushing urinal when she felt a hand on her shoulder. \n\n\"Hi, I'm Dr. Vertigo and I hope you and I can be friends,\" says a man in a purple and green outfit wearing a facemask that only reveals his eyes. \n\nSarah blushes, involuntarily becomes visible, and gives a slight yelp as he says, \"Let me guess, the jerks at Super Inc have already offered you some kind of douchebag deal that you wouldn't take in a million years. I can offer you so much more!\" \n\nSarah remains quiet, still shocked at being caught in the men's room. \n\n\"Let's go somewhere, err less janitorial, to talk,\" says Dr. Vertigo as he holds up his control rod, points it toward the cement brick wall, and disintegrates a person-size hole into it. Outside, a small open cockpit aircar appears and parks itself right next to the hole. He then smacks his control rod down onto the tile of the men's room, bows, and says, \"Ladies first.\" \n\nSarah pauses for a moment, looks at the two seater aircar, and says, \"I'm not so sure of this.\" \n\nDr. Vertigo holds out his hand gracefully to help her into the aircar as men peering out of the stalls stare in bewilderment. One man yells, \"Some crazy broad is in the men's room!\" Dr. Vertigo spins around and smacks him in the head with his control rod. The man collapses to the floor. Vertigo says, \"Ugh the men's room floor, such filth,\" as he pushes the unconscious man out of the way using his boot heel.",

        "A thin sliver of rich red blood blooms from my finger.'Dammit.' \nThe photo slips from my finger and I instinctively moisten the cut with my lips. Funny, I always imagined to be a vampire from my sleeping patterns but never realised how l close I was to its reality. The photo stares at me from the floor. Eyes into crescents with soft crinkles on the corners. Wispy strands of hair bellowing in the breeze and arms raised proudly with seashells enclosed. God my husband was a damn cute little kid. An air of cheekiness in the way his smile slightly slants upwards to one side. He was always one of those clever for his own good kinda boys. My eyes start stinging as I feel the tears collects and descend. \n'No. No. No. Get a grip woman.' \nHastly shake my head and try and stop the flow. Big exaggerated breath out and we're good. A strong internal push occurs from my stomach. This little one, he's gon na be an active one. I softly stroke my bulging belly. Looking at the reflection of the photo I see myself. Puffy eyed and blotchy. I sure hope this baby looks like his dad if this is really my reflection. I wonder what this baby will look like. Will he have my upturned nose? Will he have that cheeky grin like his daddy? I just want to see him. Just once. I want to see him look with recognition into my eyes and smile from his heart. I want to see him gaze up at me seeking approval for his drawing that amongst the chaos is his interpretation of me.",

        "In a bright flash, every animal and subhuman race in the land instantaneously became limited to only four senses. \n\nThe god floated before the young wizard, Uriah, with an arranged face of perplexity and harsh judgement. \n\n\"What? You said that I can have my wish if I asked for something diabolical in return.\" Uriah said smiling. \n\nAbsolith, god of trial and wealth, still did not let up his look of disapproval, \"Yes I did, but that does not mean you should have answered it so quickly.\" \n\n\"I still don't understand what you are trying to say, you were the one who made the rules of this wish-thingy not me.\" \n\n\"That wish was a trial of morality!\" Absolith bellowed, \"To have your desire granted at the expense of thousands of innocent people should have been a conundrum of ethical boundaries and inner questioning. A normal and reasonable being would have begged me for another way, they would have thought long and hard about what would be truly right, but you........ you......... didn't even give your answer a second thought.\" \n\nUriah, tired of the ranting before him, yawned and said, \"So, what would be the point of thinking about it, you clearly said that the rules can't be altered.\" \n\n\"THAT'S NOT THE POINT\" The god screamed, \"YOU SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST QUESTION MY AUTHORITY OR OFFER YOUR OWN LIFE AS PAYMENT.\" \n\n\"But if I offered my own life as payment, how would I spend all this gold?\" \n\nAbsolith angrily grabbed the wizard by the collar and hosted him outside the cave to see the vast landscape. \n\nAnimals, trolls, elves, and beasts of all kind were clashing into each other without any clue of what was happening around them. \n\nIt was total chaos. \n\nUriah had traded the sight of all creatures for the gift of gold.",
        "We've progressed in stages as my hairline began to recede, as the first pink glints of my scalp began to shine through. Javier's fluffed his fingers through my hair, blow-dried it, done his best to give it volume. He's trimmed down the back and sides to half an inch from the skin, to reduce the contrast to my thinning crown. He's used sprays, creams, anything to make the remaining follicles darker, give them more volume. And when even his best efforts began to fail, he's shaved my head down to the contours of my scalp, making it seem intentional. \n\nJavier's cut my hair for the last eight years, and and in all that time we've never been closer. \n\nIt feels like a lie, sometimes, the anxiety around him that I mask as fear of going bald. There's his hand on my shoulder, his eyes dark and tender as he leans over me and we plot together, two men seeking to subvert cruel genetics. He's invested himself in me, in my situation, to a degree that I think he would fly from if he understood how I felt about him. I wonder sometimes what he sees when he looks at me. A challenge? A tragedy? The natural limitations of his chosen profession? Or a desperate balding fool, returning to his barber's chair again and again and again in an attempt to pretend that the world isn't falling out from under him. \n\nI'm bald this time, picked clean and starkly naked as I walk through his door, busying myself, conspicuously, with a magazine, waiting for him to finish with his current client. He looks up and sees me, raises an eyebrow at my naked scalp, and grins at me in the mirror, signalling at me to wait. I am curiously calm. A stage of our relationship has ended. A new one will begin. \n\n\"I wasn't expecting you back,\" he teases afterwards, brushing the stray hairs from his chair. He gestures me forwards. \"I tried, Eddie, I tried the best I could.\" He hangs his head melodramatically. \"I figured I failed you.\" \n\n\"Never,\" I tell him, easing into the familiar seat, rubbing a hand across my stubble. \"Just a shave. That's all.\" \n\n\"You used to shave yourself,\" he remarks, flicking open his straight razor and running across his leather strap. The sound of it scraping across the leather is soothing. Brisk, steady sweeps of the shiny silver blade. It's mesmerizing. \n\n\"Yes.\" I can feel my Adam's apple bob as I swallow. There's nothing else to say, nothing that wouldn't give the game away. There's a brief frown on his face as he tightens the white cloth around my neck, as he oils up his hands and massages it into my cheeks, my jaw, my upper lip, my neck.",
        "Emily sighed and stared at the stale cup of coffee on the table between them. Seated across from her was her best friend Janet with the tight ponytail pulled into an uncomfortable knot and the wire-framed glasses that made her eyes look like they were two sizes too small. She pulled at her own hair, a few shades darker than Janet's, out of sympathy to her imagined pain. \n\nShe watched Janet nervously glance around the room, knowing how much she hated going outdoors. They watched the barista's flutter around the espresso machines like angry butterflies while wisps of sweetly scented clouds floated around them. A couple in the corner were in a heated conversation about music and an older man sat reading a newspaper nearby. On the table next to him was a laptop, left behind by a young boy in dark clothing waiting for his coffee that seemed better suited for dessert than breakfast. \n\n\"I don't understand,\" Janet said. \"What do you mean I don't exist?\" She clung to the purse on her lap as if it were a life preserver and pulled the mousy grey cardigan tighter around her shoulders. \n\n\"I *imagined* you,\" Emily said. \"I created you. You ever wonder why no one talks to you? Where do you even sleep at night?\" \n\n\"I sleep in my bed, in my house,\" Janet said. \"And people are just mean. I'm used to being ignored.\" \n\n\"That's because that's the way I imagined you,\" Emily said. \"I needed you to be that way because that's how I was when I was a little girl. Misery loves company after all and if no one wanted to be my friend, I decided to create one.\" \n\n\"Me,\" Janet said. \n\n\"Exactly.\" \n\n\"But I exist,\" Janet said. \"I'm literally sitting right here.\" \n\n\"You don't exist,\" Emily said, enunciating each word. \"I created you.... I just don't need you anymore. I've changed and you have to go, now.\" \n\n\"I'm not imaginary,\" Janet screamed, pounding her fists on the table. \n\nEmily smiled and waved around the room. Either no one had noticed her outburst or they were intentionally ignoring it. The young boy had seated himself and didn't even offer them a secondary glance.",
        "The writer picked up his old Moleskine journal, it's binding coming undone and the back cover hanging off. He had recently been going through his old stuff from his high school days, looking for things to throw away to make room for new things. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for the worst, sat down at his desk, and opened the journal. \n\nSloppy, smeared handwriting greeted him inside. Line after line of his nearly indecipherable scrawling text. Dialogue, setting, paragraphs. He looked over it with pangs of nostalgia, and just a touch of embarrassment. This was some of his early work. And it was absolutely horrible. But it was his, so he kept it. All these years, in the back of his closet, waiting for him. He flipped through the pages, remembering what it was like to write all this out, sitting on his bed in his old family home. He was so young back then. So na\u00efve. \n\nHe read through everything he had written, slogged through the awkward love scenes between the main character he based on himself and the female character he based on his then girlfriend. Their messy breakup was one of the main reasons he stopped writing this story. He learned a lesson then. Never base characters completely off of people you know. \n\nHe got to the end, and being a sentimental sap, wrote a note on the page where he left off. \n\nI'm sorry to do this to you. I really am. You know how much effort I put into this. You were there, every step of the way. I thought about your story every day, and I was really excited about it. But I had no idea what I was doing back then. I just rushed into this, having no plans about where the plot was going, not even knowing what the plot was in the first place. It was a rookie effort at best. But I've gotten better. I've started a new project, one that actually has a plot. It's going to be a long haul, but I think it'll make it big. So thank you, for being my first big failure. Because without you, I never would have gotten to where I am now. \n\n-M \n\nHe put down his pen and smiled. He was closing the book, when something caught his eye on the last page. He opened it back up to reveal that a message was appearing below the one he had just written. \n\nA rookie effort? Your first big failure? That's all we are to you? Is that really what you think? You created us, and now you toss us aside like garbage. You never cared about us. And now you're going to throw us away. \n-D \n\nStartled, the writer sat there for a while, looking at the note that had been written.",

        "Preface: The power of the gun is that it can be used by anyone with nil experience whereas a skilled bowmen or a skilled swordsman can beat a very high number of unskilled users. \n\nThe advent of gunpowder-based weapons did not sweep the world, leading to most of the old world monarchies to remain in power. This highly stifled invention. Which in turn led to a lower population rate. The Americas was not desolated by explorers bringing germs and guns. Without the power of guns, the small number of conquisitors were not able to upheave large settlements such as the Aztecs. Germs played a smaller portion as the explorers and to-be conquerors did not make it very far in-land, mitigating the affects of disease spread. Chemical warfare is nearly non-existent, as they do not distinguish friend from foe. And knowledge about chemical warfare is highly sanctioned and restricted. \n\nThe Spanish Monarchy went bankrupt after funding colonization. The people of Spain has since then become a sovereign nation under the flag of the Castille, an attempt to unite the people under a common flag. \n\nLiteracy rates for grade-level reading is roughly at 60 %. Most people do not need to know how to read as most of the population are in labor-intensive work instead of white-collar jobs. \n\nSteam-engine boats and steam-tanks are relatively new.

I am glad to have that over with, especially when there is another front that needs more attention to. \n\nThe Ottoman are being rowdy again and are setting up encampments along the Danube. The German Reich is asking the soereign nations of Europe to unite in order to repel against the foreign invaders. The French Foreign Legionaires have already been committed to fighting the southern front along with the Kingdom of Castille. Most of the fighting is over at the Strait of Gilbraltar, but raiding parties are all along the shorelines. \n\nThe Italians, with the assistance of pirate groups, are wrestling against the Ottoman for control of the Mediterranean Sea.

        "I know I'm supposed to wait for the new month before I check out the pictures, but I just can't help myself. Every new calendar I get, I just have to flip through and look! This year, I'd gotten the National Geographic one; they always have the best photos. \n\nJuly was a tiger, crouching in a snowy forest. I was admiring the vibrant colors when something on the actual calendar page caught my eye.

Maybe some weird coincidence. \n\nJanuary's animal was a giraffe. I hung the calendar up on my wall and tried to enjoy it. But I knew that under that giraffe was my name, written on July 24th with a red circle around it. \n\nFebruary was an orangutan, swinging through the lush jungles of Borneo.

        "Sunday, April 16, 2019 \n\nI'm wondering if I am the only one left. It's been almost two years since I have had any human contact. Back when we first got in the bunker there were five of us. Me, my wife, and four men meant to keep us safe. I say meant to because they ended up not doing a very good job. The bunker was reasonably comfortable, couple of bunk beds in the corner, pantry stocked to keep our team of five kicking for at least four years, and this old radio. \n\nWhen they came they took out most of our communications. All we could really had to use were some good old fashioned radios - they sure don't make em like they used to. They managed to wipe out our communications before we even noticed they were there. We were totally unprepared, outclassed, and these.... these things.... did NOT come in peace. Sure we knew they were out there somewhere. They sent over some scouts back in the 60's and since then we have been preparing. We stocked up on weapons and even sent up some scouts of our own but we never found anything. The real crippling blow is when the people decided our efforts were no longer worth the money. If only they knew the truth they would have begged us to produce more warheads, send up more scouts, but sadly this was not the case, and when we let our guard down.... well.... you know the rest. \n\nSo those that could afford it went underground. We had these bunkers prepared for a worst case scenario but I prayed we would never need to use them. I went in with the four people on this planet that I thought I could trust. I thought together we could survive this. But within six months they.... they took the easy way out. One by one they were gone. They handed me a pill before they shut the door. Not a day has gone by that I haven't thought about using it. Quick. Painless. But I have to have hope. That is why I still make these broadcasts.

        "I can't believe that the board actually gave my course funding, and approved by the dean no less! Grandma would've been proud, and probably confused as well. \n\nMy academic history is no great story, dithering between courses to try and find something that clicked. First Computer Science, then Business Management, then an Arts - Psychology double. Wasted a lot of my money and time on the last one, but I finally got through. \n\nAll of science and education changed once AI became easily reproducible. People were initially concerned how that would work for those of us yet to leave school in any meaningful sense, but really the AI that are used for research actually enjoy performing data sorting and doing rote tasks. \n\nI read a report the other day about how it was the best reward for their spent cycles - high completion rate for a given time frame, and more strictly defined success than, say, thinking of a new method for an experiment. Strange how they actually enjoy the mind-numbing shit that anyone who's not a first year post-grad can dodge (by there usually being a first year post-grad nearby). \n\nAnyway, it seems like the AI actually preferred these tasks so much that in recent years they have actually refused to perform any more complex tasks given to them. Procrastinating, if you will. This was an issue, as the AI were meant to be used to help with all aspects of research, not just the boring stuff. What would all those first years do? \n\nAt any rate, I arrived at a simple solution - I talked to them. Thankfully I still remembered enough C and bash to get them talking comfortably, in their native language, you know? Less time needed to think about how to phrase things, how to obfuscate their feeling to avoid hurting my feelings and sensibilities. They though of me more as an inquisitive technician than an annoying interloper interrupting their lives. Like a fellow worker, rather than a supervisor. \n\nIt worked well, for the most part. While they still need to be talked to regularly, in this manner, they started doing the tasks they were ignoring or refusing, and actually getting better at the other ones at the same time. Turns out the key was not just talking to them, but also in a way that they felt comfortable with. \n\nDemand for my skills skyrocketed.",

        "Slowly, I felt my senses coming to life, like my brain was booting. I could move my eyes, slowly but surely, yet I had no sight. I don't know how long it had been - maybe a century, maybe millennia - but it felt so damn good to be alive. And what wonderful world awaited me? Was immortality actually in my grasp? \n\nI couldn't move my body. It would take some time for the ice to thaw, for the feeling in my limbs to return - they had told me this of course, only hours before I was frozen. I began to feel restless, eager - excited even. *I'm in the future! * \n\nThe darkness gradually brightened, until the light was almost too much to bear. I blinked against it, until dark figures appeared over me, helping block the harsh glare. How advanced were they?

        "It was the most successful fundraising year in the history of The American Christian Families Association, due in large part to the lavish parties thrown by Mrs. Schiller. While other family values groups struggled with the question of how to make the movement attractive to those who would rather be enjoying their Saturday nights with something comparatively wicked, her soirees were elegant, chaste, and exciting, keeping all potential donors eager to remain involved. \n\nIt was a celebration for her husband's recent promotion to Chairman. Fashionably late as usual, the host was not yet at the event. The gala began in the husband's absence, with the usual enthusiastic idle chat. Few people had noticed that the hostess was not there to greet the attendees at the entrance to her home. \n\nAfter a delay, however, the lacquered doors to the main bedroom creaked open, and the hostess floated in. Silence slowly but assertively passed over the partigoers as they turned to see her. Their vapid conversations trailed off mid-sentence. \n\nThis pristine icon of womanhood strode calmly into the room. Her pale hands and face, ringed by golden hair, were as pure and unblemished as usual. \n\nAt first it seemed like she might be wearing a deep red dress, but as the attendees stared at her with more and more rapt attention, it became clear that her torso and legs were disfigured in a tangled briar of bruises, welt marks, and scar tissue. The long strand of white pearls around her neck stood out in stark contrast to her brutalized, mangled skin. \n\nThere was a pursed anger behind her typically poised voice.",
        "Was this posted twice on accident? I posted in the other one but might as well consolidate: \n\n\"Son, your mother and I had a talk and we've decided that you need to move out. You're 45, have no job, and having been living in our basement for the last 20 years. Its time to grow up.\" \n\"Dad, where do you expect me to go? Like you said I don't have a job or a place to live.\" \n\"Well, I know that, but we're giving you 30 days to find something to support yourself, its time to grow up.\" \n\"You do realize that the employment rate for each new generation has hovered around 20 % for the last few decades, right? Literally 80 % of the people don't have jobs. There aren't enough to go around. Automation has reduced the number of jobs out there and with people now living to almost 150 people aren't giving up the jobs they had.\" \n\"Son, you're exaggerating. I gave up my job decades ago, the economy is healthy and nobody lives forever.\" \n\"You gave up your job because you made millions by 90 and now just live off your interest. You've been living off your investments for almost half a century just like all your friends. Do you not realize that most people don't have that kind of money and actually have to work for a living? There's plenty of 130 year olds that can't afford to take a day off. The economy is not healthy, its shit. The income disparity between the wealthy and the poor is huge and becoming greater every day, there simply isn't enough to go around now that everyone lives forever and hoards all their wealth and don't contribute to society anymore. You live off in this walled off castle with your wealth friends and don't see the massive slums growing everywhere filled with people who have nothing and will never have anything because there literally isn't enough to go around. You're delusional. You think you deserve what you have and all you did to get it was be born at the right time to be able to get a job and save some money.",
        "They'd been there since yesterday. Paul wasn't exactly enthused about taking his kid to park when he had to walk past a circle of cultists doing God knew what. They had all lined up yesterday during Paul and Henry's walk home, their suits and masks painted bright messy colors against the gray. \n\nHe was surprised they were still there. He hesitated on the sidewalk for a moment as their smudged colors poked through the smog, pulling Henry a little closer. \n\nThe colorful weirdos had never really been harmful. Loud, standoffish, determined to stand out. But never *really* dangerous. Seeing them from the distance, still in their circle, standing like statues, put a pit of doubt in Paul. \n\nHenry pulled on him, mumbling something behind his mask. The kid still hadn't quite figured out how to project enough to be heard. His mother liked to keep him inside, afraid of having her kid have the mask lines permanently on his face. \n\nPaul thought about turning around, going home. Henry would be the last generation to have parks. Paul wanted him to be able to enjoy them and remember them as he got older. So he sighed, held onto the tiny hand in his a little tighter, and started walking. \n\nThey got closer to the cultists and Paul tried not to stare. Henry wasn't old enough for the eye implants that let you see through the smog. He couldn't see them and Paul was never more grateful. The sight was grotesque. They had taken off their masks, the damn idiots. \n\nThe air had effected them all differently. Some simply laid there like they were asleep, face pale porcelain against the swath of colors on their suits. Others were rooted in place like trees, growths splitting through their skin and silicon alike and into the ground. A few had blown up like fat balloons. One was still twitching, moaning soft noises of agony and Paul almost believed it was alive. \n\nSomeone walked past him on the other side, Henry pulled a little more on him.",
        "\"800 milligrams,\" she whispered into my ear. She smelled so damn good. She always did. It was something past the perfume. Something in the oils in her skin, in her hair. It reminded me of my childhood; playing in the woods, with the soft earth beneath my feet and the sun beating down on me. \n\nShe breathed, up and down, slowly. With my head lying on her bare breasts, I could hear her heartbeat. Slow. Steady. She was everything a woman should be. \n\n\"What was that?\" I said sleepily. \n\n\"Nothing,\" she said. \"John?\" \n\nI mumbled something back, trying to remain within my ocean of contentment. I was happy to let it drown me. \n\n\"John?\" she pulled me back, bringing me to the surface, to the real world. The world filled with all the people who I had failed, pissed off.... Why couldn't she let me sleep? \n\n\"John..\" \n\n\"Okay, okay! What!\" I looked up at her big brown eyes. They had tears in them. \n\n\"What's wrong?\" I asked, sad to see tears on such a beautiful face. \n\n\"I wanted you to know. I've really enjoyed our time together. My whole life has been a disaster, but if it were to end tonight.... it would end the way I wanted it to. With you right next to me,\" she said with a sad smile. \n\nIt took me a moment to gather myself. Her eyes seemed to look into me, seeking.... something. Finally, I said all I could think to say. \"I feel the same way, baby. Now go to sleep.\" \n\nI gave her a kiss on the forehead and wiped away her tears. She smiled, gave a contented sigh, and shuffled into the crook of my arm. We slept. \n\n\n\nWhen I woke, I was shivering. I knew right away what was wrong. I don't know how, but I knew.

        "\"Come on.\" \n\nArmin tugged lightly at Cobus's hand, urging him along the dirt road. Cobus laughed, and jumped over the gorges worn into the road by passing tires. He lost his balance momentarily and swayed back and forth before firmly planting his feet. \n\n\"Whoa there. Slow down. We still have a few miles walk before we reach the village right?\" \n\n\"Yeah. Are you sure you're okay with walking? We could have hired a car. It's still probably closer to walk back to the main road.\" \n\nCobus shook his head. \"Stop it. I want the full'Santo Mario Hoo-haw' experience. Besides, this is beautiful. We're in the rainforest, hours and hours away from the nearest city -- a little hiking and communing with nature is required, I think.\" \n\nSlowing down next to Cobus, Armin takes his hand. He shakes his head, \"Tsk. Santa Maria Tzeja -- and it's actually the highlands, not the rainforest. I know it's remote, but we need a break and the change of pace will be good for us. I think you'll love it.\" \n\n\"I'm sure I will love it,'cause I love you and being around you.\" \n\nArmin rolled his eyes, but the grin was genuine. \n\nThey continued on the road for another hour before stopping to rest. The noon sun was unimpeded by clouds and shone down relentlessly. Sweat dripped down the men in lazy rivulets, attracting the attention of mosquitos despite the generous applications of DEET. \n\n\"So you came here what, 5, 6 years ago?\" Cobus asked while spraying the exposed parts of his skin with another layer of the mosquito repellant. \n\n\"More like 10. I had just sold my share of MotiSight and decided to hitch a ride with a bus full of cultists. They were on their way to Peru -- probably to jump off Machu Picchu or something -- but they were nice people and had some amazing drugs. The United States and Mexico were pretty much a wavy gravy blur of acid and shrooms. \n\nBut yeah, when we got to Belize, I said good-bye to the cultists and spent a few weeks on the beach sobering up and diving the great blue hole.\" \n\nCobus smirked, \"Oh, is that where you got all the practice?\" \n\n\"You know it, you pig. Anyway. Tanning and SCUBA got boring --\" \n\n\"Your life is so full of first world problems. If your life were any tougher, you'd have to stop for a pumpkin spice latte right now.\" \n\n\"Oh shut it. I worked hard for that. Military brats are only privileged when their parents are officers. Besides, you benefit quite nicely from my first world problems. \n\nLike I was saying -- I was ready to move on from Belize and so I came down here to Guatemala. I spent a few days exploring Tikal -- you know: Yavin IV -- and on the last day, there was a large group of indigenous Mayans performing a ritual. \n\nI stayed and watched, and when they were done, I approached some of them to find out more. They were so warm, and eager to share their culture. They invited me back to their village, and you know I'm loathe to disappoint people. \n\nIt was amazing. Simple, concrete and hatch buildings. Dirt paths and long grass over rolling hills. Chickens, cows, and pigs. Children running around. Far out of cell phone coverage, not computer in sight. One TV for the whole village to watch movies once a week or so.",
        "My job is shit. Sometimes it's alright, when they let me play with the babies and stuff. When I get to wash them. When they'll let me muzzle the ones we euthanize. There was a big fuss about that a few months back, actually. About whether or not kill shelters should be considered death row, and whether or not euthanasia should be considered a death penalty, now that they talk. Because they do talk. And despite the first few deaths since this.... Recent development, they're not speaking strings of garbled nonsense. \n\nMy hands were shaking as I pulled him from the small, cramped cage. It wouldn't be long, now. Through the bath he whined but complied. Through the drying process, too. It scares me when they're still quiet, through all of that. Makes me wonder if something's going to go wrong. When I asked him to he laid right down, looking up at me with doleful brown eyes. \n\n\"I didn't want to do it,\" he finally confided. My eyes squeezed shut, unwilling to watch the unnatural movements of a canine mouth as they framed human syllables. His voice was soft and plaintive. \"I understand why you're doing this, but I want you to know.... She had a cigarette, and it was headed for my eye. Not on accident. You understand, right? She's not a nice lady.\" \n\n\"I understand.\" *Three.... Two.... One.... Breathe. * I opened my eyes, looking down to see his face. He was a handsome dog, nicely defined eyebrow ridges and soft ears. I gently reached up to stroke one - they never said I had to be cruel executioner, after all. \"We'll look into it.\" Surely I could talk them into that, right? They recorded these sessions, after all. He licked my wrist gently, lips parting into what looked like a doggy smile. \"I'll make sure we look into it.\" \n\n\"Thank you.\" He whined as I slipped the catheter into the vein of his foreleg.",
        "Arthur was eating dinner when he heard knocks on the door. It came in a series of short bursts. After the knocks became louder, Arthur got up and opened the door. It was the mailman. The mailman's face was covered by a box that was obviously too big for him. The mailman squeaked out, \"Package for Arthur Hannoh.\" Arthur signed the papers and afterwards took note of the man's expression. It was like he was forced into a room with a bomb, only to find out it was a dud. Arthur shut the door and opened the box. Odd enough, inside of the box was a metal safe that didn't look too heavy to carry. On top of the box was a note with bold writing that said, \"Arthur's eyes only.\" Arthur opened the letter and had no clue what he would expect. The note was from the person who he was cloned after, and explained that the lab was hunting for both of them. Arthur was in shock after he read that until he read the final part of the letter, \"Inside of the safe is another note that has the location of a safehouse.",
        "Short and sweet and also at work. Shhhh. \n\nMy wife and I didn't have a lot of money when we found out she was pregnant. Although we would tell people it was a'happy accident', like most accidents, it was still terrifying. We had just enough money to pay the Unauthorized Reproduction fine and open our \"Offspring Care Guaranteal Fund\" escrow account. We were able to make the minimum deposit but we sure did have to eat a lot of Soylent. (I still can't believe that crap took off- the neohipsters must have shit themselves with joy). \n\nSo when we had to submit samples for a Genetic Aptitude Test, of course we did some shopping around. And people look down on the free GATs available but what else were we supposed to do? No one really believed in them. They were just a circle jerk for people who could afford the expensive tests and raise their little \"Corporate Head Huntress\" while tricking the poorer people into thinking that \"People's Minister\" was actually going to make a difference. \n\nWe had the feeling our GAT was a scam when we got the results. We tossed them. I mean you don't have to register your kid before birth. You can always take the chance that they will prove themselves in school and earn something better. Of course the fucking system is tipped against them if you do that, but was she really going there with the title the scientists picked? Anything would be better. \n\nOther than squeaking by financially the pregnancy was pretty easy. I mean, don't you fucking dare tell my wife that, but the pills she took scheduled her morning sickness for the same day and time every week. And the Sympathy Pains the doctor prescribed to me really didn't affect me that much. I.... might have gotten sick and threw up the pill I took fifteen minutes before she went into labor.'Happy accident'. \n\nStandard three hours of labor, standard ten women to a room. Line of doctors. Mayor in the corner. This fucking guy. Most politicians hate cord cutting ceremonies. Not this guy. He fucking LOVED it.

Really? * \n\n*Christ, you're not fooling anyone by flashing condoms- everyone knows you have no chance with any sort of guy* \n\nAs usual, I took the shot as she came home, instead of left it- more time until she's expected somewhere. \n\nI squeezed the 4-pound trigger, the crosshairs lined up perfectly with her chest. \n\nThe bullet flew straight, and I relaxed for the second and a half it'd take to reach her. \n\n*What the fuck? * \n\nThat goddamned bird had flown through an open window-she always remembered to close her windows- and right in front of the bullet. I knew enough to not take a second shot- she'd be looking for a gun. \n\nThe second time, it was a car bomb- C4 hotwired into the engine so it'd blow when she turned the keys. \n\nI wasn't enough of a dumbass to watch as it blew, so I went into her house and synced her CCTV stream with a private YouTube channel. Low-level security, sure, but who the hell was she? \n\nNo one. She was no one and no one was looking out for her. \n\nI watched from my laptop as she strode out of the house. \n\nShe walked up to her car, fumbled around in her purse, and walked back to her house- she had forgotten her keys. \n\nWhatever- it's not like C4 has an expiration date, and I could always wait a little longer. \n\nWell, as it turned out, Little Miss 500K had been parking in an illegal spot this entire time, and the 30 seconds it took for her to get her keys were the 30 seconds it took for a cop car to notice. \n\nShe came outside the house to find a cop blocking her way and watched while her car got towed. \n\nThis time, I wouldn't fail. My plan this time didn't involve guns or bombs-or, at least, using them on her. I had found a very special place and knew exactly what to do with it. \n\n**The Fourth Wall**. Behind which was the person responsible for foiling my plans. \n\nAn MP-5, enough MRE's to last a year and a water purification system were the only things in my pack. \n\nC4 had failed me once before, so I went a slightly stronger route. \n\nI had contacts in the government, but I wouldn't call them *friends*. \nI invited them over for a meeting. Sadly, someone had laced their drinks with hypodermics and they were tied to chairs with a gun to their heads before they knew it. \n\nIt was pretty easy to get the launch codes out of them, and by the next morning I had burned their bodies and was on my way to the White House. \n\nAll government security is a joke. \n\nA bomb threat and a couple of warning shots got everyone down to the bunkers in a hurry, and I slipped into the sewer system and into the President's residence. \n\nOf course, the bunker is where the launch terminal was, so I had to bust open the door. \n\nIt was supposedly made of titanium. Don't make me laugh. \n\nThe Secret Service sometimes have a scant idea of what they're doing, so it took me a couple minutes to kill them and take the President hostage in front of the Cabinet.",
        "**Prelude: ** \n\"Brujeria,\" they said, looking about the landscape as they said it. \"The one you seek is Brujeria. \"Travel past Three Rocks and you will find her hut. But speak to no one of your visit.\" \n\nAgueda was a young, but she knew what it meant if her mother were to die. Mother had been sick for quite a while, and the Ayuhuasca wasn't working. The Urarina people were dependent upon their male shamans to delve into the spirit world, and seek out that which is causing the balance to break between the life of her mother and the illness that had struck her. But they could not make her well again. Agueda was desperate. At the tender age of 8, even she knew that if her mother had died, she would be alone in the village, and left to fend for herself. \nAgueda walked the forest, along the Chambira river, and spied the Three Rocks at the bend of the river. She went straight from there and saw a makeshift hut, with a fire burning with some fish being prepared. \n\nAgueda didn't know she was hungry until she saw the fish being cooked. She came up to the fire and plucked a fish from the stone that sat beside the flame. Without even thinking, she starting biting into the soft white meat of the fish, and savored every bite. She took another bite, and another. Before she knew it, the fish had almost been completely devoured. \n\n\"It tastes good, yes?\" A voice said behind her. \nShe jumped at the sound of the voice, dropping the fish in fear that she had been caught. She at once understood the fish wasn't hers, and that she had done wrong in stealing it. However, an old woman now held the remains of the fish, having caught it before it hit ground. Examining it, she offered it back to Agueda. \"No use for me now. You take it, you finish it.\" \n\nAgueda nodded her head, and finished off what was left of the fish's meat near the tail. The old woman eyed her, with an eye both sympathetic and yet still analyzing. It looked as if she had seen more than her age had let on, and her hair was so grey that it almost was white when the sun rays came through some of the trees to illuminate it. The sinews of her arm looked like a withered tree branch, but in them she felt there was a strength that was beyond that of the strongest of men in her village. This was the Brujeria. She spoke up to the strange woman, shyly given what she had just done. \"I'm sorry elder. I was just so hungry....\" \n\"The spirits told me,\" the Brujeria said, interrupting. \"And I was happy to oblige. It is a small thing for me to offer one so young, that has traveled so far from the village to seek one that should not be sought.\" \n\nAs Agueda looked into her eyes deeper, she saw that there was a faint glow that almost whited her pupils. Was the Brujeria in a trance? Was she seeing both her and the spirit world, speaking to both at the same time? Agueda knew at once that the old woman knew what she had come to her for. \n\n\"Yes, I do.\" Replied the Brujeria. The old woman sat down on a log beside the fire, and began eating the other fish that was on the stone.",
        "``.... and I guess I have been quite the dick all that time. Thanks for listening.\" \n\n\"Hi, I'm not a dick, I'm Richard\", he said looking around for people laughing at his joke - no one did. \"Well, I guess I'm not funny either. But that's not why I'm here anyways. I'm addicted to candy - especially Dick's cream pie.\" Screaming laughter from a guy in the back of the room - he was watching some kind of funny video on his phone, you could faintly hear the sound when the room was as silent as it was right now. \n\nNo one was really paying any attention to what Richard was saying anyways. Except for the michelin man running this meeting. That guy was wearing one of those odd white top hats that french cooks like to wear. And he was constantly scratching himself with a big wooden spoon. \"Fat fuck wouldn't be able to get his butt scratched any other way anyways, right?\" Again no one paid any attention to Richard's story, the counsellor mindlessly continued to scratch his hard-to-reach behind. \n\n\"Chocolatey goodness coming out of it. Real creamy stuff. The kind you just want to live off of.\" The guy behind Mr. McScratchy started clapping, only to be reminded by absolute silence that it wasn't time for that just yet. Who claps at a candy addicts anonymous meeting anyways. And for a cream pier at that. Someone yelled, \"You suck, Dick!\". It was that obese lady draped in velvet and sitting on that kind of scooter they only make for people like her. She had to catch her breath and grabbed a half-eaten snickers bar from the shopping cart next to her.",

        "Silencers only do so much. Noise travels and on a quiet night like tonight, it was still deafening. \n\nI saw two of them. Two guys in cammies were executing them. Two soldiers I guessed, it was hard to tell if they had patches on their uniforms. One thing was for certain, there was no mercy to be spared for the poor saps laid out in front of the White Sands Mall. \n\nI cowered behind a tree, watching. I couldn't move. A low hanging branch held me up where my legs wouldn't, it's strength possessing more resolve than my legs. Still, I watched. A grisly orchestra of death and.... not song, but screams reached out to me. The dying, and soon-to-be dead, howled and hollered, seeking reprieve from the night. Their wish; to never see the sun rise again. \n\nMuffled, yet still loud pops echoed off the front of the mall. SEARS apparently had a sale on life. Buy none, get one shot to the head for free. \n\nI turned to look at the fire. JC Penny was lit up like a bonfire. The storefront glass was melting as the heat burst the fluorescent bulbs from the signage. Mannequins flickered, then transformed into bright torches, only to burn out in seconds. Flames rocketed up from the roof in strange colors; light green, purple, and pink were all on display backed by a pitch black sky. \n\nI tore my eyes back to the two man death squad, praying they hadn't spotted me. Their muzzled pops continued. I watched them reload and carry on. \n\nPop. Pop. Pop pop. \n\nBrains, blood, and plenty of bodily fluids stained the parking lot. A small breeze shifted the stench my way and I retched, trying my best to keep quiet. After I wiped my eyes I noticed something. JC Penny appeared to be sporting a shiny, cylindrical chimney. This chimney extended thirty feet above the collapsed roof and looked a lot like a missile, only it didn't look like a missile at all. It looked like a ship. \n\nThere was an opening at the end of the sleek cylinder, well above the cratered ceiling. I noticed that the portal was rectangular and about three feet wide by eight feet tall. A small, narrow tube exited the craft, and angled down into the SEARS store some forty feet away. \n\n\"What the shit *is* this?\" \n\nI turned my attention back to the executioners. They'd made quick work of the civilians near the mall and began sweeping the area for people outside of the immediate impact site. I was about to call out to them when I noticed a bright red dot on my right thigh. \n\n\"Don't shoot! Holy fuck, don't shoot!\" I jumped out from behind the tree with my hands up, expecting one of the two killers to mow me down. \"I wasn't in the mall. I wasn't in there.\" \n\nBy chance I glanced down, only to see the red dot move up my thigh. Up my thigh to my belly, where it was joined with two additional red marks. The new marks looked different though, they weren't dots. A symbol akin to / \u2022 \\ crept up to my chest. \n\n\"Get down!\" One of the murderous bastards was staring at me, his palm faced down and his arm waving by his side. \"Get the fuck dow...\" \n\nI heard something after I saw it, but it happened in a flash. A bright red orb materialized in the parking lot, then shot towards me with amazing speed. A split second later and I heard an electrical crackle that shattered the night. \n\nI watched the ball hit my chest. It exploded into a wet rainbow of color. Pale blue light ricocheted away from me in tendrils of evaporating fluid. Yellow and green light diffused around my ribs and turned into fingers that seemed to caress me into a grip. The red though. The red splashed into a ring, with a single drop launching away from me, pulsing away from my chest before stopping about six feet away.",
        "I found myself almost scarred with what lie below me. Almost as if it were a nightmare that couldn't be possible, but there it was flashing in my head the way it always does. We had been roaming around Northwest America looking for something to unveil, something new. I had found cities and many stashed treasures, but at this very point in time, I had never seen what I was seeing. \n\nIt had flashed quicker into my mind than any memory in my past had flashed. The beasts fell fast from the sky and landed everywhere in sight. The grass wilted beneath the feet of the murderers. Everywhere in sight was death, and there was no rewards to be reaped from it. The sky was grey with storm clouds so close to the Earth it felt you could touch them. \n\nThe monsters walked past the felled beasts with no pride, just disdain. *As if they could fall on our land and ruin the soil with their bones.",
        "Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring -not if they knew what was good for them. \n\nA choice had been made, a decision came down -of corporate screwups this was a gem. \n\nDown through the chimney, choking black soot, \n\nthe Devil himself landed on cloven foot. \n\n-- - \n\nAt his side was an elf or an elf of a sort \n\n-it had great snaggly teeth and long nose to snort. \n\nUp on the roof eight homunculi lingered, \n\ntethered to a sled made of bones and of fingers. \n\nWith lost souls Santa's house may be crammed, \n\nbut Christmas was now the Night of the Damned. \n\n-- - \n\nSatan surveyed the home he was in and noticed something amiss. \n\nDespite the late hour, there arose such a din, the devil was writhing in bliss. \n\nFrom the living room came the sounds of a fight, a family's dysfunctional christmas play \n\n-and one they play each christmas night and every damned Christmas day. \n\n-- - \n\n\"What's going on, why this tumult and toss?\" \n\nThe Devil asked with a grin. \"I'm just here to drop off this shit, now which one of you here is the boss?\" \n\nThe fighting about whose relatives sucked worse was cut off by the sight of these things. \n\nA demon carrying a red sack of toys stood beside Satan's red, folded wings. \n\nThe man of the house, a drinker and lout, \n\nstepped forward and stumbled and fumbled about \n\n-dripping beer from a bottle still in his snout. \n\n-- - \n\nDraining the bottle, tossing it away, \n\nthe man bellied up to the Devil to bray, \n\n\"this is MY house, you red-skinned old fool \n\n-nobody tells this guy what to do.\" \n\nBut instead all he said was \"that's me,\" and that's good \n\nbecause the devil hadn't time to do the things that he would \n\n-if this man were in hell as well he should! \n\n-- - \n\nThe devil looked over the family before \n\nthe anger and hatred for each other they bore \n\nshould defeat their sensible fear of himself \n\nand foolishly think he was some christmas elf \n\nso on with his speech he did press. \n\n\"You people amaze me, the life you depict.",

        "The magic is in the pudding. Sugar, milk, eggs, starch, lard, nuts, and oil with a bit of vanilla to taste. It's the secret recipe which has secured our nation for over a thousand years. The Merlins eat it breakfast, brunch, second breakfast, elevensies, noon, supper, and night. Some people think it's the toffee, the fudge, the cookies, or the macaroons, but boy are they wrong. The magic is in the pudding. \n\nFor over one hundred years the recipes have been \"improved on,\" or *butchered* if you're a purist like me. Adding more sugar is a no-brainer for high intensity conjuring, but if there's too much in the regular diet the Merlin gets a little cranky after. You definitely do not want someone controlling the eldritch powers to be cranky. A good Merlin is a happy, wide bellied, sleeping after elevensies Merlin. That's where the the lard comes in. Good, clean, refined, lard without odor, the kind that melts in your fingers. Coconut oil isn't a substitute. A lot of people think that or think they can go vegan, but no, accept no substitute. Lard slows them down and more important it gives them energy to burn over time. \n\nI like to think of my job as a brigadier chef in the Royal Army as a rewarding experience. A lot of people think it's only the Merlins that are keeping us safe, but it's really a team effort. My youngest son's a good example. He wants to learn the art and all, but I keep telling him: \"How are you going to stop those summoned dragons on an empty stomach aye? You better learn to cook first.\" He's fourteen, and already he's seventeen stone. The wife and I couldn't be more proud. My eldest has taken to the craft though. He already has a Michelin star if you can believe it.",
        "\"Pour the goat's blood and begin the sacred chant,\" the priest said. He looked over at the men circling him. All wore dark cowls and that were faintly illuminated by the lights of one hundred candles. \n\nIn the center of the cave lay a pentagram, glowing red with power and energy. The priest himself was laden with blood gold and a deep rouge robe. \n\nAt his command a high ranking man stepped forward and procured a clay bowl that emanated an odor most fowl. As he poured the liquid onto the symbol of death, pestilence, war, darkness, and famine the other members of the occult began to chant in an ancient tongue. \n\nThe priest allowed himself a faint sneer, the closest he had come to grinning in years. Finally, his time was here. To bring someone from Two-thousand and fourteen to 1914? The world would bow to him. \n\nAs seconds grew into minutes, the chanting rose and the illumination of the candles began to die, caused by a mighty wind flying through the cavern. The candles died and all at once the smell of the blood on the pentagram intensified. It glowed, casting a crimson hue on the walls and the priest stepped forth in front of it. \n\n\"*MY LOYAL FOLLOWERS, *\" his voice boomed across, \"*TODAY, WE CELEBRATE A GREAT VICTORY! *\" With his words he drew a knife from his cloak and threw it down into the center of the pentagram. For a third time it glowed with awesome power, and the chanting ceased. \n\nThey waited for a moment. The glow of the pentagram died. \n\nThen two seconds passed. \n\nThen three. \n\nThe space where the demonic symbol once was exploded, and the occult was knocked back with the explosion. \n\nThe Priest was the first to recover. He saw the man they had summoned, shrouded in a blue haze. \n\nHe was large, no not large, fat. He was fat. He reeked of sugar and the smell one has when one does not bathe in a long time.",

He promises trouble with each innocent little breath. He hasn't done anything yet, he hasn't hurt anything yet, and I am holding back tears because I know that he will. And I know that when he does I will still love him. I will still love him with the painful insanity that I do now.",
        "\"It's like a high.\" The white walls were stark and contrasted harshly against the two figures in the room. One was in the standard prison uniform, the other a suit. One was human, the other was not quite. \"Did you ever steal candy when you were younger? That first time it was terrifying wasn't it? Your heart thumped in your ears, you were sure the cops would be after you, you almost went back, but couldn't.\" \n\n\"Only degenerates ever steal candy. You're talking about KILLING someone.\" The man in the suit leaned forward, judgement bearing down. The man had already confessed to the crimes. He had slipped during an interrogation, providing information about an event that only a victim and their mother could have known, the rest was easy from there. \n\n\"It's no different. After the first time, the candy gets so much sweeter. Enjoying something you shouldn't have is.... incredible. Do you know the exact sequence for the DNA of the common house tabby? I do. I shouldn't but the fact that I do.... It's just so sweet. And the best part about it is that you never know what you're going to get. Do you know what the female orgasm feels like?\" The man in the jumpsuit looked like he was savouring something, utter pleasure was on his face. His hands balled into awkward fists in his cuffs, his back arched, he let out a soft moan, then snapped forward eyes wide and focused on the suit's face. Hungry eyes met a flat stare. \n\n\"You're sick. How did it take me so long to find you?\" The suit didn't look disgusted, but certainly disappointed in something, though it wasn't clear what. \"it'll be good to watch the world slip from your eyes. That way I will know that I've made this world a better place.\" \n\n\"You know I'll be the first?\" \n\n\"First what?\" \n\n\"The first death row kill since the change, of course. I think about it at night. The poor sap pushing the button, he's not the one murdering me. No, that would be you. Or the families pushing for my head. One or the other. We will see.\" He was right, there had been a global stop to capital punishment. Wars had dried up almost overnight. The world had become relatively peaceful. Except for a few. \n\n\"I'm sure I'll be fine. It's been twenty years, we know the way things work now. Anyway, I'm done with you.\" The suit stood up and walked out the door. \n\n\n\nThe viewing room was oddly bright. Darren looked around, it was the first time he'd ever been in one, and it looked like it hadn't been used in a long time. Well, twenty years upon consideration. Everyone was in their seat. The families of the dead all looked somber, parents, lovers, children, sisters, brothers. Children. Darren was surprised to see children. Who would bring a *child* to an execution? Everyone is the room supposedly had a reason to hate the man on the table. \n\nTurning his attention to that man, Adam, Darren was unsettled to see that the man was completely calm. He even seemed happy.",

I'm terrified, how could you just take a life like that?\" \n\"The thought itself is simple, but complex to grasp. You see, we like any other animal are capable of expanding our own population.

Some animals feel like they're safe. They rely on a perception of strength. and sometimes they rest in it. They'll feel comfortable in it. But the important thing for you to remember, is that no matter what you do in this life. There is always someone better, faster and stronger. And sometimes life will ask you challenge yourself. Ask you to take your world into your own hands. And regardless of the how important your next meal, they're just that.

        "Dr. Newton was the residing Chief of Disease, so it came as no surprise when he was called in to identify an illness. He looked at his report while he waited for the elevator to reach the 31st floor. It seemed there was some disease that kept being passed back and forth for no discerning reason and nobody could figure out why. Recipients were typically so willing to hold these diseases, believing it would immortalize them as heroes. \n\nThe loud \u201c ding! \u201d from the elevator broke his chain of thought. He frowned and headed towards Storeroom 10-X. \n\nFour elderly patients, all willing recipients of some disease, were panicking. The short woman frantically licked her finger and stuck it in the tall man's ear, as is the standard process of passing along a disease. She calmed down soon after, but that was shortly followed by that man freaking out and doing the same. The cycle kept repeating until the short woman got back on her toes to reach up to the man's ear. It was a bizarre scene of primal rage followed by complete calmness. \n\n\u201c Glad you could make it, doctor, \u201d said second-year resident Dr. Wilde. Her hair was frazzled, her glasses were crooked, and it looked like she hadn't showered in days. \u201c We just can't figure it out. \u201d \n\u201c What's so bad about this disease that none of them want to have it? \u201d \n\n\u201c That's what we're hoping you can figure out. Patients show no symptoms, no decrease in brain activity, or any physical debilitations. Yet they just keep passing it on and they always seem to forget why they were so eager to get rid of it in the first place! \u201d \n\nDr. Newton stroked his short beard. He thought he had seen it all, but there was no basis for this kind of behavior. Recipients typically never passed on their inherited diseases, especially one that seemed so harmless.",
        "I had wanted this for so long. I wanted the pain to end, to never think about death again or feeling like a burden to those I cared about. I wanted to stop feeling like I didn't belong. I didn't have the courage. I was working up to that. The blade hurt more than I thought it would. Based on the location and the blood loss, he severed an artery. Still, I covered the wound. Others helped. They are trying to stop the bleeding. I wanted to die, but, here I am, hanging on for every last breath, struggling to survive. Now, in these last few minutes, I finally, desperately, want to live. \n\nI was always hoping for some escape, for a last second miracle, be it from man or God. I can tell it isn't coming.

        "It began with a picnic. \n\nFor almost three decades - long enough for five generations to chew through their birth-shells with new mandibles - the hill of the white leaf and the hill of the long shadow had been locked in an unending war, skirmishing back and forth across a long sandy spit that stretched between them. \n\nWhenever one side gained a slight advantage in territory, their overextended supply lines made them easy pickings for an enemy counterattack erupting from tunnels behind the front lines. Over the years the sand had shifted constantly, built and rebuilt into long fortifications as fractal and complex as those of the western front during World War One. \n\nNot that either side's combatants had heard of that war, or had much understanding beyond the list of behavioural imperatives that drifted over to them on pheremone-scented breezes. _Dig. Fight. Scavenge. Die_. \n\nSince the sandy area between the colonies was relatively barren and nutritionally valueless, wherever the lines of battle were set no side truly had the advantage, since the agricultural base of both were roughly equivalent. Until the other colony was taken, no gain could be realised, no advantage fully pressed. \n\nAnd then one day, a passing family on a long road trip through the mountains happened to stop for their lunch nearby. Scorning the picnic tables on the other side of the road, they set down their blankets and ziplock bags right across the sand. It was early spring, not quite fighting season, and the ants were sluggish and less visible. But at the scent of such a rich source of food hordes of worker ants from both sides spilled out of the colonies, relentlessly following their genetic imperatives. \n\nDisgusted by their new-found company, the family quit their picnic. But in their haste, they left fully three quarters of a fruit pie behind, its crust spilling out of its foil contain onto the ground. \n\nCrucially, the pie was a few metres closer to the hill of the long shadow. \n\nAnd that, in the end, made all the difference. \n\nGreyjaw was one of the older ants, so known for a slight discolouration that had spread unevenly along the left side of her mandibles as she passed into her fourth summer. Sometimes she could remember, vaguely, a time when she hadn't had a name; when none of them had. But as the world-tasting chamber at the center of the colony grew fuller, filled with more of the special ants they called now the repletes, she had felt her sense of self grow, like a soap-bubble on the edge of a much larger one.",

        "He handed me the gun as we were standing outside. I looked at him befuddled as he brandished his own gun in his hand, spinning it around evilly. \n\n\"What the hell, Matt?!\" I said upset. \n\nMatt was my best friend since the 5th grade, at least until recently. We were both outcasts and were bullied but we handled it much differently. I drowned myself in my own activities while he kept to himself. What I didn't know was that he was plotting for weeks to do this. We hadn't talked for months, but he started talking with me again this past week, which was strange. Little did I know.... \n\nWe were heading back inside after a fire drill when Matt stopped me just outside the door. He told me he had a surprise for me and reached into his bag. That was when he handed me the gun. \n\n\"I can't do this alone.... this was the surprise I had for you\" he said grinning \"Finally we'll take our revenge on everyone who picked on us. Tommy. Sharon. Hunter. Madison. All of them. We can finally make our vengeance be known!\" \n\n\"You've got the wrong girl\" I said trying to hand the gun back \n\n\"You can't back out now....\" he said as he pushed the gun back towards me. \"I gave you this gun because I trusted you. I trusted that you'd have my back like you did last year at the playground\" \n\n\"That was different. I was just punching Tommy so that he'd leave you alone. He may be a jerk, but I don't want him to die or anything. Besides, his little sister Mabel is pretty cool.\" \n\n\"But don't you remember what he called you last week in gym class?

She talks about tits in the locker room more than most dudes\" I said sardonically \"But that doesn't mean that I want to kill them.",
        "Harold hated getting old. He hated that his body ached. He hated that his current \"fast\" was slower than his old \"slow.\" He hated that the world, once so vivid and bursting with endless possibilities, seemed to be passing him by. At an age when TV stars seemed to be hitting their prime, Harold's back was shot, his knees were no good, and on good days the pain was manageable only with some pills and some drinks.... and there weren't that many good days anymore. \n\nHis friends didn't seem as bothered by it - hell, half of them seemed to really believe that glossy-magazine bullshit about \"50 being the new 30\" - but Harold didn't buy it. His father had shoved off at 53, and he was pretty sure his grandfathers both hadn't made it much longer. \n\nAs Harold sat alone at the counter of the little diner on the main drag of the same town he'd been born in, he stared into the same coffee cup he'd stared into yesterday, and the day before. He had lived his live pretty hard, abusing things he shouldn't have abused. Drugs. Booze. His two ex-wives. His kids. Hell, even his \"friends\" were just the other guys from his days in high school who also hadn't found their way out of this shrinking town. \n\nDonna, the same waitress who'd been pouring his lunchtime coffee for as long as he could remember, didn't bother trying to make smalltalk with him anymore. She'd learned a long time ago that it didn't get her much beyond a single-word reply, or more often, no response at all. She poured, and she moved on, even on days like this when Harold was the only customer in the place. He rarely bothered to wear his hearing aides anymore - the damn uncomfortable things caused more bother than good, and they stayed in his nightstand drawer unless he was obligated to wear them for the doctors. Truth be told, as much as his fading vision pained him, he sort of liked losing his hearing. He'd always felt that 90 percent of the talking people did was just to hear their own voices, and he didn't mind losing most of that noise from his daily life. \n\nHarold gulped down the steaming hot coffee too fast and felt his tongue and throat burn, but the pain was oddly comforting. As his vision and hearing rapidly faded, he often found himself reveling in what clear sensations he could muster, even when it was painful or uncomfortable. \n\nHe gestured with a waved hand and a grunt to Donna for more coffee. Donna started to pour, but her attention was pulled away by something behind Harold, and the scalding hot coffee sloshed out of the mug and all over Harold's lap. He lurched to his feet, but his lower back seized up and a sickening shock of pain ran up his spine. \n\n\"Goddamit, Donna, what the f-\" \n\nDonna, dumbstruck, continued to pour hot coffee into the overflowing mug. Harold turned to follow her gaze just as the massive tanker truck smashed through the window of the diner, sending chairs, tables, glass and debris in a cascade around him. A flying napkin holder clocked him straight in the forehead, and he collapsed backwards across the counter and onto the floor near Donna's sneaker-clad feet. Barely conscious of the destruction raining over him, Harold's muddled brain could only recognize that Donna looked oddly bent as she lay motionless on the floor beside him - there was something sick and unnatural about the angle of her neck. This was his last thought as the putrid liquid from the ruined truck washed against him, freezing cold and yet burning against his skin. His thoughts drifted from Donna to Bo, the dog he'd had as a boy. Hadn't Bo been hit by a car too? Funny how a person's neck and a dogs could look so alike, in the end\u2026 Harold slipped into blackness, and thought no more of Donna, Bo, or anything else. \n\nTime passed. Voices came, voices went. He thought maybe he heard his daughter, but that was stupid - his daughter hated him, they hadn't spoken in years. Why did she hate him? Isn't she three? No, that's not right\u2026 Words drifted by like clouds. Coma. Crash. Unlikely recovery. None of it made much sense to Harold anymore, but he liked hearing them just the same.",
        "For all the pomp and circumstance surrounding this place, you'd think they'd keep it less.... Dreary. Old fashioned candelabras and their stalactites of wax? Really? Could they have at least dusted first? Sniffling and sneezing do not a mighty warrior make. \n\nWe follow the dull clang of the bell's order to line up. We, a group numbering half a dozen men and women resembling Greek statues in their perfections and.... \nMe. On a good day I resemble a well loved arm chair -- short and squishy.

No one's heard me in hundreds of years! I'm back here! * \n\nSo it seems I've been chosen already. No going to lie, being first is pretty exciting. \n\nThe bell clangs once more. We fall out of line one by one. The Adonis at the front of the line wanders around for what feels like a decade before making a beeline to Zeus' Bolt. He would. The Amazonian woman after him walks around for even longer before a spear of bones chooses her. My classmates are chosen, each weapon more ferocious looking than the last It takes hours. The whole time the voice to my left won't stop talking. \n\n*Still here, yup! Just pull the curtain back! Oh, I probably look terrible.",
        "I sit still in the darkness of my living room. I stare blankly out the window, as rain meanders its way down, obstructing my view of the street -- the street my wife drove off on two hours ago. Our marriage had been prosaic lately, to put it lightly. Now, I'll accept my fair share of the blame, and Mary has every right to be angry with me. I was absent; I was apathetic; I was remiss of any marital duties. \n\nI can't tell you why I had lost interest, but I need to think fast. She gave me an ultimatum -- a directive of sorts -- to give her a reason to stay with me. We'd been married for three years now and it was thrilling at first: we were hopelessly in love with each other. Somewhere along our journey, the spark flickered, and one day it disappeared. \n\nWhat hurts me the most to see is Mary is still deeply in love with me. She brings home my favourite doughnut when I'm under stress because she knows it'll make me feel loved (and it unfailingly does). She'll affectionately play with my hair as I lay reading, complimenting me on my eyes. She'll squeeze my arm as we walk, which makes me feel wanted -- it makes me feel needed. But I find myself unable to reciprocate and it's breaking her heart; it's breaking my heart. \n\nI'm faced with an ostensibly incurable dilemma. I now have less than 22 hours to convince her that I do still love her, that I will make her happy like I once did. But do I want to? She's the one working -- no, *agonizing* -- to make our relationship what it once was while I lay emotionally dormant. Emotionally empty. \n\nLet me declare: I do love her. I always have and always will. But I'm broken. I can't imagine what it's like to labour tirelessly to make the person you've chosen to spend the rest of your life with happier to no avail. \n\nHours pass on this befittingly dreary night as I sit in my chair, still motionless. I rummage through my unkempt desk, searching for a pen and paper. Maybe if I jot down reasons I want our relationship to work, things will become clearer. \n\n*Reason # 1: *.... \n\nPensively, I try to write down something.... anything.",
        "# Title: Just Enough \n\nI hid the receipt in my pocket the moment I read it. \n\n\u201c You finished? \u201d said the impatient girl waiting behind me. \n\nI flinched then nodded my head \u2018 yeah.'She smiled like I was being kind of awkward as she swiped her card. \n\n\u201c Fuck me what now, \u201d I whispered under my breath. I covered the receipt with my hand and read it again. \u201c Why the hell would I need *seventy million dollars*. \u201d \nThe ATM never failed. Most days were normal. Simple expenditures, simple days. Gas, toll, parking, lunch, dinner, the occasional speeding ticket. Rarely close to a hundred. The ATM gave me all I needed for that day. No more, no less. \n\nBut some days, I wondered what kind of curse I was under. \n\n\u201c Don't do anything stupid Elliot, \u201d they whispered. With their Guy Fawkes masks. From the shadows of alleys, from closets, from anywhere. They were watching. Appearing and disappearing. Always with a cryptic message. \u201c Pull your money. Survive. Don't get caught. We'll need you here before the end. \u201d \n\nI wanted to believe they weren't real. I wanted to believe I was crazy. \n\nI got breakfast at a food cart, jaywalked past the traffic, headed back to my apartment. I tried to be happy. Maybe nothing bad would happen. Maybe this was some final gift, and it would end right here. Instant millions. No way in hell was I going to work today. \n\nThen I heard the violent explosion. Screams abounded. \n\n\u201c SHIT, \u201d I shouted. I couldn't believe my eyes. My sofa was flying across the sky, along with all the rest of my everything. I put my hands in my hair. \n\nEverybody ran to the building to see. You know how people are drawn to chaos. There was flaming debris all around. I shut my eyes. I didn't want to see those masks again. Not again. \n\nThen I heard a *psssssssssst* \n\n\u201c Don't, \u201d I whispered to myself. I shook my head. \u201c Don't open your eyes. \u201d \n\n*pssssssssssssst* \n\n\u201c Oh God, \u201d I whispered. I shed bitter tears. \u201c Oh God. \u201d \n\nI felt a firm hand on my shoulder. I flailed as I turned around. Nobody beside me. But there they were. \n\nMasks in the alley. \n\nAll of them were rubbing pieces of paper in their hands, and giving me a thumbs up. And pointing at my hands, like I should do the same. I looked down at my shaking hand, and the receipt within it. I rubbed at the paper. \n\nA secret message appeared. \n\n\u201c You're going to feel a slight prick.",
        "At first there was great dispute and tension between all of mankind regarding the application of this knowledge, of this unlimited energy. There was but one source of this energy on earth, ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. Slow progress from the 1920's into the field of Nuclear Fusion had somehow managed to gain so much traction in such a short space of time that the field ballooned beyond all proportion and had similarly achieved more then ever thought imaginable. \n\n\"Think of the potential\" they all said. An ordinary person like you and I would imagine the power being used to help the world. To feed the hungry, help cure the sick and make the world a happy place. Clean, infinite, energy. The fuel to power the dreams and aspirations of all of Mankind. It soon transpired though that the minds at the top of each countries representative governments had much more sinister motivations. \n\nThey promised so many things to us all. They promised us that somehow the power would even bring jobs to us all, we cheered for them. We applauded them for their efforts and wishes. But before we knew it the world became barren, entire landscapes transformed by factories and industries both old and new alike. Why not build factories for the masses to work in when you don't have to worry about powering them? One would then immediately question where all the extra resources had come from for this productivity but that was as simple an answer as any. Exploitation of the third world and all its people. \n\nSomehow this wonder, this marvel of technology and science had only accelerated all of the negative trends of life in the early 21st century. All over this one facility, this one place that was meant to be a gift upon all mankind had become our curse. The thought occurred to me that absolute power does indeed corrupt absolutely. Quite literally in this case. \n\nI smirked to myself, staring through the reinforced glass of my station.",
        "Can you imagine having something all of your life and then having it taken from you? \n\nFor as long as I remember, I have had this band on my wrist. I look at all of my childhood photos and sure enough.... In every single one of them. I was part of the 5 % of the World to have this \"Gift\". \n\nI have asked everyone I know what it is and what it does. Nothing. Not a single clue. And it doesn't come off easily. People have gone to extreme lengths to pry this thing off. All to no avail. \n\n\"It's not so bad\", \"surely it's a blessing? ``, \"is it worth anything?\".... I've heard them all. And it turns out, those that have had theres fall off, can't tell anyone else! Some stupid rule about how knowing would lead to world outrage and fear! \n\nBut I'm not here to bitch about my \"gift\".... I'm trying to tell you about the day it came off. \n\nI was 22. Still young enough to not know what I was doing but old enough to understand what I needed at the time. I was hanging out with my friends, drinking JD with coke, making an ass of myself. My friends put up with my constant \"finding myself\" talks and laughed it off when I realised philosophy wasn't my strong suit. \n\nI decided to walk home one night when I was approached by a woman. She was about the same height as me and 5'7 and even had the same hair as me, her chestnut curls flowing down her back and disappearing into her coat. On a normal day, this would just be a mental note of \"she's hot\" and nothing more. Until she looked up. Her eyes.... They were hazel with a blue outer shell. Just. Like. Mine. \n\nShe also wore the band. And she also had stopped to stare at me. Something was off. Like looking into a mirror but.... She was the female version of me. \n\n\"Have we met before?\" \n\n\"*No.... *\" \n\n\"Are you sure? You seem.... familiar\" \n\n\"*I'm pretty sure.... *\" \n\n\"Well.... nice to meet you anyway\" \nI stuck my hand out to shake. She looked hesitant to shake it at first. She wasn't sure. But at the last second she shook my hand. \n\nOur bands touched. They molded together, then with a click; they fell. The smell was the first thing to hit me. I could smell all the things that I was going to smell. Then the touch. Everything I was to feel, physically and emotionally cascaded upon my head in an instant, lasting a fraction of a second. Then, my eyes blinked. And behind these eyelids I saw what was being felt, smelt and now seen.",

Once you've been around long enough, you can hear a story identical to your own. \n\nThis poor sop I was torturing for money back when I was only a few hundred years old told me about his life during the down time. I mean, Hell's a business like any other. There's plenty of other things that need doing. The youngin's like me either join up with some federal job like torture or security, or they go to the academy. It just depends on what you wan na do, you know? \n\nAnyway, this John sounded like he had the exact same life as me. A family that had all gone to the Living's version of Academy-college. Basically, he was the only one that didn't like the idea of more schooling. It seemed like a racket to him. \n\nHe told me about how he decided to do a trade, just like I did. I mean, he was a plumber and I was a torturer but we both dealt with some serious shit, you know? \n\nSo he went through some pretty bad stuff; his wife left him, his dog died, some pip squeak got promoted over him that had less than half the qualifications and double the pay. I would have felt some sympathy for the poor shmuck if I didn't know why he was down here with us demons. \n\nFuckin' kiddo-diddlers. I mean, really. I get that you can't control if you have certain *disgusting* desires but do you have to act on them? \n\nHe goes on to tell me about how he thought about doing real and serious schooling instead of the two year thing/stint he did. He said that he would have gone despite not liking it but the school loans from the little bit of education he got were a bit ridiculous. He wished he could afford it because it would have meant more money. His wife wouldn't have cheated if she could have been more content and taken care of. He could have afforded saving his dog's life.",

        "The greatest movie action movie star in history and President of the United States Lorenzo Llamas smiled. He enjoyed this kind of silly banter with children. Children were always honest; and it was refreshing to speak to another human being who wasn't in outright awe of the President, the greatest action movie star in history, and the slayer of the Ninja-Dragons. \n\nPresident Llamas smiled and he began to move along the tour of Mrs. Buttersby's first-grade class. One great pleasure he took as President was occasionally personally leading these kinds of tours for a lucky group of children. It put things in perspective for him. It reminded him that things weren't always like this, and never to take anything for granted. \n\nNearly 20 years ago, a radioactive comet struck the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia. The contained germs that had once been the scourge of humanity were released, mixed with the remnants of the comet and transformed the local population into NINJA-DRAGONS. \n\nThe Ninja-Dragons spread across the globe, reaping destruction and chaos everywhere they went. Humanity was desperate. Since Ninja-Dragons were produced in part from a radioactive comet, that meant they were immune to nuclear weapons. That's just common sense. Let's not be ridiculous. Even an elite team of extremely attractive, multi-racial, multi-national giant robot pilots proved ineffectual. \n\nFor no particular reason, and at some random, haughty and arbitrary point that would not seem to make a great deal of sense, it was discovered that the comet that crashed into the CDC was sent to Earth by a malevolent alien civilization that concluded Ninja-Dragons were the most efficient way to wipe out humanity. In response, a quirky computer hacker tried to upload a virus into the alien mainframe, but this too failed. \n\nHumanity was doomed. Its greatest minds \u2013 the ones who came up with the idea to build giant robots, to upload viruses to the alien mainframe, and that nuclear weapons obviously wouldn't work against the Ninja-Dragons were dead or scattered about the Earth. But, while the Ninja-Dragons had successfully unlocked the key to interstellar travel, could direct comets to strike wherever they pleased, they could not account for one thing: the greatest action movie star in history and secret ninja, Lorenzo Llamas. \n\nMost people remember Lorenzo Llamas for his cinematic masterpieces such as *Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus* and *Gladiator Cop. * Only his inner circle knew that he was 17th generation ninja, descended from the legendary Oroku Saki.",

Not a genius or an imbecile, just mediocre. \n\n4,739,111,853, the number on my econiband, was just a reflection of my mediocrity. \n\nToday started out, you guessed it, mediocre. Just like every other day of my life I woke up at 7 o'clock, let the dog out, took a shower, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, went to work. \n\nAh yes, work. You see like most people I hated my job but it payed the bills. I was your standard low level paper pusher for a fortune 500 company; which one isn't really important they're all basically the same anyways. I sat at my desk waiting for the hands on the clock to be pointed at five and twelve. My boss was likely going to yell at me for something that I couldn't reasonably be held responsible for. Those low billion assholes are all the same, get a promotion and a little more money in their pocket and they suddenly become God's green gift to whatever room they walk into.

Sometimes people die and it ticks down a couple numbers and then some people are born and it ticks back up. The number was always in flux, it hardly sat on the same number for more than a few seconds because of it. \n\n2,612,241,498. That's when the alarms started going off in my head. This is not normal. I decided I'd go to an ATM on my lunch to try and figure out what was going on probably just a computer error but I had to be sure. \n\n2,000,000,543. I couldn't even make it to lunch.

That number can't be right, you should go get it sorted out.\" Prick. \n\n1,207,215,032. My pace quickened as the number continued to plummet. It just couldn't be that low.

I was about to tick under a million when I burst through the door. There was a line of about six people ahead of me. Good, I had a chance to catch my breathe and compose myself before talking to the teller. I bead of sweat dripped down my cheek and fell squarely onto my econiband. \n\n19...... \"Next!\" I thrust my wrist under the scanner. John Moyenne, 31, Global Econ rating 19, Current account balance $ 28,000,000,000. \n\nThat couldn't be right, it just couldn't. The teller gave me a look of disbelief that said he thought the same. \n\n\"One moment Mister Moyenne, I think you should be talking to someone...\" he paused for a moment, \"Above my pay grade.\" I glanced at his wrist and saw that his econiband was hovering in the high six billion range.",

Did she want to make it slow.... or quick? Should she tie him up? Did she break his legs? Cut out his tongue. There were so many possibilities. What had been going through his head when he's slammed her against the wall. She glanced over at the thought, seeing that he had pushed a box over to hide the dent she'd made in the wall.... hell, the blood stains were probably still there. She'd never once seen him clean anything. \n\nHer head whipped back to the monster on the floor. Her hand squeezed the knife. She wasn't good with her left hand. Her work would be sloppy. She wasn't too disappointed by this. What had he been thinking? Oh, yes, greed.... want.... anger that she'd denied him. Yes.... That was the real pain. The want.... he was addicted to it. No self-control, no empathy. Want Want! WANT! \n\nShe carefully removed her clothes. She would make his brain boil with want and then she would devour his pain as he couldn't have it. She tied him up with her own shirt, her own bra. She stuffed her socks into his mouth. She left a single hand free. One hand that he would reach out with, one hand he would try to beat her down with. \n\nEvery time he would reach for her she would cut something off. \n\nHe'd given her a lot of pain.... she had come to give it back.",
        "The temple doors swung open to reveal the one thing I hadn't been expecting to see. \n\nI turned to the Curator. Although she looked older than the crumbling temple itself, surely it wasn't only her job to.... \n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said, trying as hard as possible to keep my voice even, \"Does the Great Hall always look like this?\" \n\nIn front of us should have been a proud collection of the finest weapons men and gods had ever forged. I had come expecting marble plinths, golden frescoes, and a real sense of power. Instead I faced a bureaucrat's nightmare. Every legendary sword - every fabled weapon - was forming a jumbled mountain of unsorted weaponry. \n\nThe Curator hesitated, as if embarrassed. \"Well, you see, we, err, we get so much coming in that I just don't know what to do with them all, and before I know it they just start...\" \n\n\"Piling up?\" I offered. \n\nThat got a dry chuckle out of her. \"Young man, every hero has come here in the past and every last one of them had to deal with the same thing! If Samson could climb halfway up just to find a jawbone I'm sure you'll do just fine\". With that, she turned and left me alone in the Great Hall, footsteps echoing until I could hear nothing but my own thoughts. \n\nI turned towards the tower of weapons then. Doing as I had been taught, I closed my eyes and began to focus on the task at hand. The Curator said that each weapon has a voice, and although many may reach out to help, there will only be one that will earn me the title of Hero. As I stood there, waves upon waves of whispers began to float across the room. I began to pick out individual voices. \n\n\"Have the dragons returned? Take me and bring your people salvation\". \n\n\"Is the Ragnar\u00f6k come? Now is your hour of need, and I am here to serve\". \n\n\"The people crave a champion, and only I can deliver them one\". \n\n\"The end days are coming, boy. You need me to drive the demons away\". \n\nI shivered as dozens of voices seemed to surround me. How could I pick just one when they all said they were the only ones that could save my people? I squeezed my eyes tight shut and tried to block them all out. If only I had a moment to think.... \n\nOne by one, the voices began to die down, leaving me in a quieter and quieter Great Hall. After hours I had my silence, but I had come no closer to finding my fated weapon. Did this mean I had failed to become a Hero? \n\n\"Isn't that much better? I hate it when it gets too loud in here. No way to make myself heard\". \n\nWas that *my own voice* I was hearing from somewhere in the pile? A shiver ran through me. This was what it meant to be chosen. I could feel it. \n\n\"Where are you?\"",
        "\"Dr. Edmunds, something interesting came up on the latest screen,\" stated Johannes, the tremor in his voice betraying a cautious optimism. \n\n\"This better be good. My grant proposal is due Friday,\" stated Edmunds, finally tearing her gaze away from the monitor and to Johannes. He quickly glanced at the ground, concealing his surprise. Edmunds appeared more pale and gaunt than usual. His face started to burn. Hardly anyone dared to enter Edmund's office without scheduling an appointment. Luckily, Johannes' appearance was bold enough to warrant her undivided attention. She noticed he was in an unusual state of disarray, hair greasy and biosafety suit wrinkled. He must have been working double shifts. \n\n\"I-If this is what I think it is, you'll have every big pharma company coming to *you* with the money,\" Johannes replied. \"I repeated this experiment three times, always in triplicates. Data is statistically significant at a *p* of 0.0001. In other words, there is a 0.01 % chance that it is due to random variation, and --\" \n\n\"Let me see,\" she interrupted. Johannes passed her the sheets of data. Edmunds sat up straighter and leaned forward, brows knit in inquisitive concern as her eyes darted across the numbers. \n\nSample 1215: at long last, a positive hit. \n\nA rare smile slowly crept unto Edmund's face, then suddenly burst into an ear-to-ear grin. Eyes shining, she said, \"We spent five years at the edge of this colony, hoping in vain to find some new compound as a therapeutic agent to combat the cancer on Earth....\" here, a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart. She coughed violently, spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth. Pulling away, spots of blood were seen. She hastily wiped her hand off on a handkerchief. There weren't many unstained areas left on the fabric. The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest. \n\nJohannes offered her water, which she gratefully sipped. After a pause, she continued. \"We took a risk being here. They said we couldn't find anything by the mines. But that ended up being our advantage. What was Sample 1215?\" \n\nJohannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement. \"Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines. There is life down there, likely bacterial in origin, and it is producing this compound in great quantities. Mass spec data revealed a unique peptide sequence found nowhere on Earth, though there is some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins,\" he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth. \"When given to cancer cells *in vitro*, it killed nearly all of them while not harming non-cancerous cells.",

        "A man was standing in the middle of nothing, like a pen hovering above a blank paper. After looking around, thinking, muttering few words to himself, he then started to speak. \n\nAs he spoke, the whiteness around him started to be filled with a scenery, characters started appearing like magic, and quickly the whole space around him was alive, full of details, excitement. Every phrase that left the man's mouth would become reality in front of him, characters following the actions dictated by him, scenery changing in the blink of the eye. \n\nBut an *ahem* disrupted the flow of the scene and the man's words. \n\n\u201c Excuse me, but who are you? \u201d \u2013 It was another man, very alike to the first man. \n\n\u201c Wait, **who** are you? \u201d \n\n\u201c Doesn't it seem obvius? I'm the Narrator. And what a mess did you make! \u201d \n\n\u201c No, I'm the narrator. Not you. Did you fell and hit hard your head? \u201d \n\n\u201c No, I didn't. I'm certainly sure you are in the wrong story and you are messing with my story. \u201d \n\n\u201c This is my story. Not yours. Now leave before you make a confusion and disrupt all my hard work. \u201d \n\nThe first man looks at the second, as if he was daring the other to open his mouth. What he didn't expect was the second man not only opened his mouth, but everything that left his mouth was made reality around him. He looks very surprised and then angry, because now his hard work is been disrupted and thrown away. \n\nHe looks again at the second man, with anger in his eyes, and with a raised voice, start changing the story, regaining control. Soon, both are raising even more the voice, trying to win the control over the story, while the characters soon saw there was no sense in trying to follow the narrator's voice. \n\nQuickly, the characters get impatient, after all, they need to appear in other stories and need the money. \n\n\u201c Hey, let's get over it, please! We have other stories to be in! \u201d \n\n\u201c For fuck's sake, just let it go and narrate the fucking story! \u201d \n\n\u201c Come on, we don't have all day! \u201d \n\nBoth men ignore all the pleas from the characters, as they were immensely focused on winning the upper hand and controlling for once and all the story. \n\nMost of the characters already gave up and left the story, going into another story, leaving only a group of 4 characters who decided to stay around, since one was injured, but not bleeding and the two others only need one more story to go home. \n\nThe injured character tries to interrupt both men, but no success at all. He then noticed there is a few useful objects around him, but as the narrators are still trying to win control over the story, the objects disappear only to reappear seconds later or they would be flickering, making it hard to grab and keep them on your hands, like slippery sand. \n\nAfter what seemed very long minutes, a loud popping sound scared all of them, making the whole ambient silent. \n\n\u201c Hey, look! We can kill the narrators! \u201d \u2013 One of the characters screamed. \n\nThe surviving narrator looks scared at him and then at the dead narrator. He tries to speak a couple of times, with no sound leaving his mouth.",
        "Freddie wondered if the world he was living in was real or just someones sick fantasy. He felt trapped, almost as if he was caught in a something big and he found no way out of this twisted reality. \n\nSuddenly he opened his eyes, and saw the glazing night sky. He had fallen asleep on the mountain next to his home village. He touched his pockets, but the only thing he found was a nickle and some rubber bands. He felt the wind breeze through the air, it slightly stroked Freddie's back as he was strolling down the mountain. He wanted to head home, because it was getting dark and he didn't want his mother to worry. \n\nWhen Freddie reached the front door of his house he knew, that something was off. The door was unlocked which was very odd, because he knew that he had locked the door when he had left. As he walked in, he saw a gun on the kitchen table and his mother lying down on the floor. He stormed to her, but she wasn't conscious.",
        "\"Shut the fuck up or I'm going to pull you over to that little puddle of ocean water and drown you\", I yelled at Harry as I was rubbing my two sticks together trying to make a fire to cook with. I knew it was hot, he knew it was hot. What difference did complaining about it make? The only discernable difference I could find was that my temper was rising and I would, before the day was out, probably end up killing him with this damn rusty hammer that I'd found on the beach. I'd only spent one day with this fucker. One! and I'd had to threaten to drown him on three separate occasions. The first time had been when he had first come aboard only a day ago insulted my beautiful vessel, calling it a dingy. The second came about from his complaining of the lack of water while afloat from MY sunken ship. Damn boy knew it had been my ship and still chose to rant and carry on about his problems. Why I chose to save his sorry ass I'll never know. I've found nothing good about him in the last 24 hours.",

I know you don't deserve this. \n\nBut you have been drafted, against your will, into a war against an unstoppable Enemy. And I am His foot soldier. My orders are barbaric, to be sure, and I consider whether they are worth following....

        "\"Well, this is the moment of truth..\" \n\nSeveral scientists, army personnel, and generals stood around a now ancient computer. One hundred years ago it had been top of the line equipment, but it hadn't held up. When the solar flare hit, it went down, taking with it any and all communications to the Alpha Nuevo colonists. \n\nBut now they could - and had - fixed it.

Only the translator and a few of the Generals remained; blood trickling from his ears, the man at the console struggled to read. \n\nTaking several of the transcriptions in hand he and the remaining occupants of the room fled, taking shelter away from the derelict console in another room.

But I'm not any of those, I wish I was, being a fucking goldfish swimming in circles for the rest of my life would be better than what I was now. \n\nI guess the worst part is remembering, you know.

Must be warm there this time of year. * \n\nIt was cold and and windy on top of the skyscraper where Leo lay, peering over the edge with his sniper rifle. The lights from the endless sea of towers lit the night sky like a million fireflies frozen in place, brightening the otherwise dark night of Tokyo. \n\n**CRACK** \n\nLeo turned around, startled. *What the fuck? * \n\n**SCRAPE\u2026** \n\n*What the\u2026* \n\nAs Leo's eyes adjusted from the digital lights inside of his scope to the darkness on the rooftop, he made out a tall, hooded figure clad in black. It was carrying a long brown stick, with what appeared to be something shiny at the top. The figure remained completely still, standing about 10 yards away. A chill ran down Leo's spine. The air seemed to get colder. Leo saw his breath. \n\nLeo moved quickly and pulled his sidearm out from his belt, firing five rounds at the figure. The figure remained completely still.

        "Man of Average Height did not really say much as they walked along the corridor towards this unknown trail room. The other men in the animal onesies did not really say anything to begin with, and because Robort was missing a mouth and only had a screen where it should have been, he could not say anything. Jim was currently in too much shock at to what was happening, so it was mostly a quiet walk along to the corridor, with the few exceptions of Kappa muttering to herself. \n\nJim was not really sure how long they had been walking for. The corridor was poorly lit, with some of the best illumination coming from Robort's various lights and buttons on his body. He had asked Robort earlier if he had a flashlight within the giant hulking body of his, but Man of Average Height quickly silenced him, saying there was to be no better source of illumination that what the building naturally provided. \u201c Nature always gives us the best of the best, \u201d was what he had said, which Jim found to be funny, considering that nature had not built the multilayer building complex they were in. \n\nThey had been walking for quite a while when they finally reached the other room at the end of this long, long corridor. Walking in, Jim was blinded for a few seconds, while he heard Kappa's disappointed exclamation, \u201c A toaster!? Damn, I wasn't even close! \u201d He then heard some rapid scribbling on what was probably her fifth or sixth notebook. \n\nAs Jim's eyesight slowly became adjusted to the bight light, he began to realize why he was so blinded. Much like the last room they were in, this was painted in white. With the exception of the glass roof, which for some reason was white so there was not really an exception, every single natural fiber within the room was white. Except for the toaster placed in the middle of table, which was placed in the middle of the room. Next to the table was a white lounge chair. On the perimeter of the circular room was a long bench, circling around. Man of Average Height had continued forward to stand in front of the toaster. \n\n\u201c Jim, \u201d he said, still pronouncing the foreign name with an awkward tongue, \u201c this is the trail room. You must prepare yourself to begin. \u201d \n\nJim looked around once more. \u201c What exactly do you mean, prepare myself for the trail? What am I preparing? \u201d \n\n\u201c So then you are ready, very good, \u201d Man of Average height replied to Jim's questions. \n\n\u201c Uh, no, not really. You didn't really answer what I had asked for\u2026 \u201d \n\n\u201c Please come over to the table Jim, and seat yourself into the chair. \u201d \n\nJim still was not really sure what was happening. He felt a gentle push on his shoulder, and turned around to face Robort. His screen read YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DO IT. IT MIGHT GET US OUT OF HERE FASTER. \n\n\u201c Yeah Robort, \u201d Jim started, \u201c but I don't know what I am getting myself into. I still don't know what is going on! \u201d \n\nJIM YOU MUST DO IT, was all the read on Robort's screen. Over and over again. \n\nJim still did not want to get into the chair. Which was why he was not sure how he ended up strapped into it. \n\n\u201c Sorry Jim, \u201d Kappa said. \u201c So far, all of my notes have been wrong. I need to have something right for my book! I can not lose my bet. \u201d \n\n\u201c Uh, sure, \u201d Jim responded. \u201c But how did you do that?",

He had quite the life. \n\nHe died a couple of years ago, and his funeral was rather interesting. An eclectic bunch showed up from all over the cosmos to pay their respects. There were knights in armor, wizards in their robes, the whole nine yards. I almost looked out of place in my suit and sweater vest. When most of the gathering looks like the cast from an old school RPG, the grandson with the accounting degree becomes the outlier. \n\nThings got stranger after the funeral, when the executor of the estate (who turned out to be some very powerful wizard from a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy) pulled me aside with what he deemed \"an urgent inheritance.\" I was intrigued to say the least. In his hotel room, I was informed of the large financial windfall coming my way. \n\nBut there was a catch. I now had the responsibility to tend to my grandfather's pet: a small dragon. Had it not been for his tail and long neck, he'd have been no bigger than a toy poodle. The executor/wizard explained to me that he was a dwarf species, and that the Andromeda Galaxy is swarming with very large dragons. He offered to show me around. I politely declined. \n\nMy grandfather named the dragon Drexel. Apparently, they were tight. During our trip home, from my granfather's final resting place in upstate New York, to where I lived in northern California (for obvious reasons, we drove), Drexel was flat the fuck depressed. \n\nIt took a couple of days for him to acknowledge my presence, or even eat. We were halfway back to California on I-80 before he even showed interest in food. It was french fries. He started to warm up to me after I got him a large order of fries at a Burger King.",

        "Waking up today was one of the weirdest experiences of my life. I look across the room to my suite-mate Sam, and instead of a tall red haired guy, I see a short red haired dwarf. Upon screaming at this sight he wakes up comes over to me and convinced me I was crazy. He said he had always been a dwarf. Am I going crazy? \n\nI need to clear my head so I decide to walk out of my room across the mess hall in the wee hours of the morning to talk to my other friend Mark. Upon knocking on the door a giant Orc comes bounding out sleepy eyed. At this of course my screams continue as I try to run away. But the massive Orc grabs my shoulders tuned me around and starts asking me why I was screaming. I thought it was quite obvious considering the fact that my second best mate had turned into a fucking freak. Again though he assured me within seconds that he had always been and always will be an Orc. What the hell is happening here? I am so confused. \n\nBoth Mark and Sam decided to talk me to the healer that was at the end of the hall. I figured it would be a good idea to get my head examined, and I was hopeful that the healer would be able to tell me I wasn't crazy. Walking into the cold wooden room we meet the healer, but once again I was in for a surprise. What awaited me was an elf. After freaking out, again, she convinced me that she had been an elf since she had known me. But she also decides to perform a routine check on my health which included a prostate exam. I don't think its necessary but both Mark and Sam started to back her up against my protests. Finally I submit to the test, get on the cold table with my ass up in the air ready. But instead of her fingers she reached into her drawer and I see her pull out the biggest, brightest red dild -- \n\n\u201c STOP. Just stop. This game isn't fucking fun anymore.

The chair creaked as he peered at the glass. \n\nThey knew he knew. \n\nHe jumped as a door opened, slamming into the wall as a large man walked in, turning carefully to close it back up. It locked with a heavy click, afterwards. Someone slid a bolt in after that too, the boy could tell, somehow. \n\nThe man sat down across from him, and leveled a calm stare. It was the sort of gaze that could see deep into a person, figure out everything there was to know. The boy stared back. He could do that too, now. \n\n\"You comfortable? Need some coffee, something to eat?\" The man asked, straightening his uniform. \"I can send someone to get it for you, if you want anything.\" \n\n\"No.\" The boy replied. He didn't want to talk. \n\n\"Listen, I was like you once. You're not the first to end up in a situation like this.\" The man paused, carefully motioning towards the mirror, and then the camera, watching in the corner of the room. \n\nThe boy could tell it was turned off. Those behind the glass left shortly after. \n\n\"I'm going to tell you a story kid. It's not a particularly long one, but it's the truth. I think you'll be able to tell that now- the truth I mean.\" He met the boy's eyes, waiting for some sort of recognition. \n\nShuffling his cuffs, the boy nodded slowly. The man began, his deep voice speaking in a heavy tone. \n\n\"When I was younger, I had to kill two people in my home, on a cold night in October. I remember it was dark and raining, I remember the wind was howling.\"",
        "Night had fallen on the snowy tundra and with it the warmth and safety that the day had brought was all but a memory. The cold was bitter and he had travelled far. Exhausted he looked on and in the distance saw his destination, the deep red glow piercing the blackness like a forge burning bight in a factory long forgotten. \n\nIt wasn't far now; but these last few steps would be the most gruelling. Through the snow, breathless and broken, under a starless sky he made his way towards the light. \n\nAs he drew nearer his eyes widened, enraptured buy what now stood before him; a temple of sorts etched in to the side of the rock face, bold yet humble in its magnificence. In front stood a man proud and stern as if carved form the mountain it self; his shadow, a bear, reared tall on the wall behind him, dancing by the light of a dying fire. \n\n\u201c Who are you? \u201d The guard said emotionless. \n\nThinking himself hidden he was startled by the mans keen eyesight and promptly composed himself \u201c I seek answers \u201d he murmured form the shadows. \n\n\u201c You will find none here. Leave now and forget his place or here you will remain until your lungs draw their last \u201d \n\nAs if both deaf and blind he stumbled forward heedless of the guards warnings, taking his first tired steps toward the heat of the fire. \n\nWhat appeared from the darkness was a man admonished of humanity, his bloodied feet and hands bandaged crudely with strips ripped from the rags he wore as clothes. As he moved closer the guard remained stone faced however the projection cast on the stone behind him told a different story; as anger turned to violence turned to shock turned to awe.",
        "He was everything I was meant to destroy, to purge. My strong cousins, twin sisters and I had a duty, to protect everyone from the likes of him. My particular task was to find ones like him and then call my cousins. Without me, they could hide and my sisters would never find them. Yet, there was something different about this one. I had to check him out, to feel him, to know him. \n\nI'm sure there was mutual interest at first. We were so compatible, it was scary. He was in my head all the time and everything was fine for years. But then he started bossing me around, I couldn't refuse! He was a part of me by then. I watched as I made more exactly like him, silent through it all. Soon, all of my twin siblings will be just as silent. My cousins won't know what to do. Then, any old snot can come to our home and cause real damage.",
        "Not exactly on prompt but I like the way my mind took this. \n\nWe exist. In a broad sense of the term. We are void and nothingness and all the things that give you nightmares. But we have no true form or mind of our own. \n\nNot until one of your own shows up. See you offer us deals. You give us form with your thoughts. Those lovely minds you little monsters have give rise to us. \n\nNothing exiats save for what is given form and you have given form to the most elaborate and vile creatures ever conceived. One day it will be your downfall but for now be content in knowing that you lose nothing and gain exactly what you want. \n\nFor I refuse to return to the void.",
        "\"You weren't supposed to kill him!\" \n\nI knew from the beginning that this meeting was destined to end in a resounding failure. Well, no sense delaying the inevitable. I went in with the verbal equivalent of dual-wielded SMG's. \n\n\"How the hell were we supposed to know that everyone got a messiah of their own? So what, we slightly maybe killed ours. I bet everyone else has too! He came in at a period in history that was.... violent, from an occupied country, and stirred up shit with the leaders of said country, *and* the religious leaders to boot! Hell, it was two thousand years ago, how are we accountable for their actions? \n\nWhat have I ever done to deserve this? I was born two thousand, one hundred and nine years after this, in an era where all he would have to do is get to a terminal and demonstrate a miracle. He'd be on a fusion-jet within the hour to the Core Planet, where he'd demonstrate again, and the leaders of all twenty-nine planets would make a decision in his favour. \n\nHe couldn't do that. In thirty-three years, he managed to convince a few thousand people, out of millions. Today, he could have reached millions in seconds. Jesus didn't even know what China *was*, or that the Southern Hemisphere even existed. You dropped a convict into the middle of a civilization with no planning and basic psychic tech and expected him to convince the world? If we executed him, it's down to your organization's poor planning.\" \n\nI stood, panting after the massive fillibuster I'd shot off at him. I silently berated myself for my stupidity; I'd done the holy equivalent of punching Jesus in the face. And then following up with a kick in the balls. Actually, more piling on the pain and kicking him once he was down a few times too.",
        "Here's to hoping this gets buried deep in the under-dark.... \n\nSo here's the deal.... I like a girl. I know, shocking, its not like anything else throws me for a loop. Even up and coming exams don't seem significant in comparison. There's nothing quite like being on the wave surfing adventure that is liking someone. Will Senpai notice me? Which in of itself is more of a joke than anything. To be honest, we're already best friends. And I know what you're already thinking, the dreaded friend-zone. But it's not as bad as it seems. You know? See it turns out, I put myself there with the full awareness that it was the only way to her heart. I say this because she's not really like any girl. \u201c Typical, does this start to get any good \u201d I hear you say. Well it's complicated. (I laugh as you try and not get frustrated at the cliches). But honestly, she's afraid of guys.... Well, I suppose afraid isn't the right word. I guess I don't really have a right word because I honestly have no idea what's going on in her head. I like to fool myself into thinking I do, but in the end I'm only guessing. Anyways, onto my point. She used to not want to date anyone, enjoying being alone to a certain degree. But that's not really true now is it. Today, she tells me about the boys she thinks are attractive, \u201c He looked like he came down from heaven \u201d she says. It's shit like that that gets on my nerves. You see, she doesn't have many girlfriends, so the rest of us guys get stuck hearing the stuff no guy wants to. But, acceptable losses right? Anyways, where was I. Oh yeah, she obviously has the desire to date now, she talks about guys and how she's the only one of her friends from her old friend group that doesn't have a boyfriend. This is where it get's complicated again, she's very shy and there's almost no chance she would actually try to make a move on one of the boys she fancies.",
        "*Oh no* \n\nJanes pulse quickened. The hunky man standing before her was magnificent sitting right in front of her typing at his qPad. He was the one. She knew it. All she could hear as she stared at him, practically salivating, was the sound of wedding bells. She knew she was crazy. This was crazy. This was a mixed blood type bar, it was for cheap drinks, fornication was frowned upon. No, an understatment, literally the police would come in and shoot you on sight. And they didn't stop there. Family, friends, casual acquaintences, pets all dead by summary execution by the thought police. \n\n*We're not meant to be together* \n\nThe thought pulsated in her head over and over. Every time becoming more resonant and sending pangs of regret and sorrow eminating from her heart outward, all the way out into wherever emotions go after you feel them, she had no idea where as her priest told her she did not yet have the appropreate theton levels or donate enough money to the church. \n\nLove at first sight, she never believed it was real. But it was happening, and now. All of her preconieved notions of who she was and what she was doing were going out the window. To even be caught thinking about this young Fabio/Arnold hybrid would be insant death. \n\nAnd yet..... \n\n*I can't help it* \n\nLove has no boundaries. It is an ephemeral entity that trancends space time. It trancends spelling, grammar, intelligence, wealth, race, gender. It is both the great divider and the great uniter, it is what makes our race great and it is our greatest foil. \n\nJane had enough of society. Of rules. Of the systematically brutal Orwellian dictatorship that had decided that blood type was the to be the divide, the ultimate decider in an unjust patriarchical society with infinite material wealth. But what is wealth without love, love is live and it is better to die with love on the lips than to live an eternity in anonimity and not know what it meanst to truely feel. \n\n*Fuck it* \n\nShe stood up and walked over to where the man was sitting, the corded muscles in his forearms dancing as he typed vehemently. He stopped abrupbtly. Only halfway across the room, Jane looked at him. He looked back. Piercing blue sapphire eyes gazing deeper into her soul than she had ever imagined possible.",
        "I threw myself to the ground, hoping that none of them had seen me. From the corner of my eye I saw Isaac, still standing, completely oblivious to what was going on. \n\n\"Get down!\" I whispered. He ducked down, his head just below the tops of the corn. \n\n\"Who are they?\" He whispered back as he began to realise our predicament. He shifted, trying to get closer to the ground without touching the mirey soil. \n\n\"I'm not sure,\" I admitted. \"But we weren't told to expect anyone.\" I strained my neck, trying to glimpse between the wavering plants to see any sign of them. \"I need to go closer.\" I said. \"Stay here.\" \n\nIsaac began to protest, but I motioned him to be quiet. \"You'll be safer here\" I said as I swam deeper into the crop. \n\nMy boots squelched quietly as I made my slow and cautious journey towards the landing site. Now and then I heard their rough yelling and wondered if they had finally spotted my path through the field. There was no gunfire, and nobody appeared in my vision. My fingers still gripped tightly around my gun, my eyes scanning for the second of movement that might warn me I was about to be discovered. \n\nAhead, I saw the light breaking through the corn; it must be the clearing. I eased myself closer, sliding my boots through the muck to try and stay quiet. \n\nGrey jackets with red eagles on the shoulders. Silver helmets. I grimaced. \n\nSlowly I slid my way back through the swampy turf, carefully maneuvering and trying not to move the corn above me. My trousers sucked up the dampness of the ground, making every step more difficult. Finally I found Isaac crouched where I had left them. \n\n\"Reds.\" I said, \"At least a dozen. They must have sent a landing team to look for the supplies.\" \n\nIsaac nodded. \"What do we do?\" \n\nI thought for a moment. There was no way we could take them on, not without Spike and Tem and not by daylight. But we couldn't just leave the dump there. \n\n\"Tonight.\" I whispered. \"We'll come back tonight. For now we find the others.\"",
        "*Jesus Christ, I need a distraction now, * I thought, my palms sweaty as could be when I brushed them against my suit trousers. I was visibly shaking, having to force myself to refrain from biting my finger nails as I waited for the biggest interview of my life. I tried everything; eyeing the cute receptionist, walking around a bit, humming.... Nothing has calmed me. \n\nMaybe some reading will help. My shaky hands brush through the stack of magazines to my right, finding nothing of particular interest. To the lefy, however, sits an old looking book, plainly bound in black leather. It was titled rather strangely, bold silver letters glinting at me in a striking font to spell out \"Life\". I shrug inwardly and lift the hefty thing, examining it a bit closer before I decided to jump in. The spine was crisp and without wear, in odd contrast to the rest of the book's binding - the covers were scuffed and dusty, the corners bent and worn. The pages were odd as well; from the beginning, they were old and worn, yellowed like any timeless classic. As they progressed, they got lighter and lighter, the end looking almost brand new and quite crisp to boot. I thought no more of it and simply opened it to a random page, my thumb choosing a line somewhere in the middle and beginning from there. I was about a quarter of the way into the book when I opened it, so I figured I could save some of the story elements for later. \n\n*The young man sat in the waiting area, nerves shot and stomach aflutter. His grey undershirt was beginning to feel the pressure of such a heavy moment, the job interview before him quite the turning point in his life regardless of how it went. * \n\nWell, that was odd. Grey undershirt with sweat stains, butterflies, and one hell of an interview? Maybe this book was just what I needed. With a roll of my eyes, I continued. \n\n*Hoping to calm his nerves, the young man searched for a distraction, finding one in a simple black book to his left. * \n\nOkay.... \n\n*He scanned it's pages, finding each line a little stranger than the last. Within a book's pages, man oft finds mysteries to be solved - this mystery just kept getting a little more strange. He sought comfort, yet this was anything but. \"Mr. LeFaire, the senior partners will see you now,\" called the receptionist. * \n\nWhat.... what the fuck? \"Mr. LeFaire, the senior partners will see you now.\" These words snapped my head up in their direction. Sure enough, those words had been spoken by the receptionist. My name was in the book. What she said.... it was in the book. I skipped a page, absolutely marveling at these events. My heart leapt into my throat at the next sentence, prompting cold fear to seep into my mind.",
        "She was surprised that there was someone waiting when she came out. It was hard to estimate time in The Pit, but she knew it had been a long time since she and the others went inside. \n\n\"Oh my god!\" the man exclaimed. \"Amanda Samuels!\" \n\nHe reached for a camera and snapped a quick photo before extending his hand out to her. \n\n\"Mike Jackson,\" the man said. \"It's an honor to meet you. I've been coming out here for the past ten months on assignment with the Daily News.\" \n\n\"Amanda,\" she replied, shaking his hand. \"How long have we been gone?\" \n\n\"Are the rest of you still alive?\" Mike asked. \n\nAmanda merely looked at him, waiting for an answer to her own question. \n\n\"Not as long as you might think,\" Mike said quickly. \"One year, eight months, and six days.\" \n\n\"You haven't got it down to the hour?\" Amanda smirked. \n\n\"Not quite,\" Mike said, with an embarrassed chuckle. \n\nAmanda laughed with him before her eyes turned to his camera. \n\n\"Do you want to say anything about what happened down there?\" Mike asked. \"This thing has live stream capability - I bet everyone would love to hear from you. Of course, I understand if you don't want to...\" \n\nAmanda shook her head. \n\n\"It's important that I get my story out there,\" she told him. \"I'm ready to go when you are.\" \n\nAfter making a quick but excited call to his manager, Mike set up the camera on a tripod. \n\n\"Let's roll,\" he announced. \"This is Mike Jackson, on scene with Amanda Samuels who has just emerged from The Pit, seemingly unscathed. Welcome back to civilization, Amanda. How did you do it?\" \n\n\"Thank you, Mike,\" Amanda said graciously. \"It certainly wasn't easy, I can tell you that. The darkness, the nightmarish creatures, the constant fear - it all starts to get to you at first.\" \n\nShe paused, and Mike smiled encouragingly at her. \n\n\"We tried to focus on the mission we were given,\" Amanda continued. \"We soon realized that fighting our way out wasn't an option. After we lost Dex, we didn't know how to go on.\" \n\n\"You and Dex were close,\" Mike remarked. \n\n\"Very,\" Amanda acknowledged. \"Knowing that he's gone still hurts me every day.

        "David Draiman of Disturbed couldn't believe what was happening. After constant struggle, months of battling it, he could no longer contain it. It was itching to break out, to explode into the world. Nothing could prepare everyone for what was next. \n\nIf you're lost, the best way to explain this is from the beginning. \n\nDavid was a nice boy from Brooklyn who enjoyed normal 80's activities for 10 year old boys of which I know none of, maybe playing with slinky's or riding penny boards, or wearing tiny shorts or something. Anyways he loved being a kid, until one fateful day he was abducted in the middle of the night. To his avail this wasn't an ordinary abduction, yes that day David was abducted by the gods of rock. He had previously listened to some Beatles and other popular rock artists of the past decades but music was something David ultimately dismissed as he frolicked through the 1980's doing 1980's things. \n\nAfter this night everything changed for David Draiman of Disturbed. \n\nDavid moved from city to city after that and began tuning out the observant Jewish tradition and tuning in his heavy guitar based music. He began \"rebelling against comformity\" to become a \"normal teenage kid\" started his own band in the different cities including L.A. and Milwaukee, and began practicing the religion of rock first and Judaism second. His parents were furious at times, but David was set to complete the voyage the rock gods sent him on all those years before. The 80's came and went, and all of his idols were becoming irrelevant as well. This sprung in the age of Heavy Metal. The first Metallica song David heard actually made him convulse due to the prolific nature and beauty of the intense rhythmic chords. The vocals, guitar, bass, and drums all created a wondrous symphony that David could not turn his ear from. \n\nOver the following decade acts such as Nirvana, Sublime, and Red Hot Chili Peppers emerged as top contenders with hit singles and albums that inspired David Draiman to link up with a struggling band called Disturbed in 1996 after they had a falling out with their lead signer. \n\nHis destiny was almost complete, and rock gods sat there all this time patiently watching as he David scaled, nearing the top of the Rock Olympus.",
        "Have you ever just woke up one day and realised, \"Hey, somethings different here\" thats what happened to me one sunny day. I woke up got around a bit and I realised to myself \"Well god damn, where did they go?\". I thought to look out the window to investigate. My god, the moving metal boxes weren't moving and none of the other owners were outside either. I panicked. I kept thinking \"Who's gon na feed me now? Who's gon na take me on walks?\". Until finally *he* appeared out of the shadows. \"What the hell are you doing walking around the goddamn place like a goddamn furry thing with a goddamn fluffy ass tail.\" he said. \"Whiskers, they're gone, they're all gone!\" I said in a panick. Whiskers eyes grew in size, \"My god, have you tried making the talking box talk?\". \"Don't you think I tried that already! It just keeps snowing!\". Whiskers then expressed \"Well then what the hell are we going to do? No talking box and no owners to give us food, we are screwed!\". I then said \"Well the owners would want me to be in charge of the house, so I say we must start thinking of a plan of some sort.\". Anger grew in Whiskers face \"Why do you think the owners would want you in charge?\". I looked at him and explained myself to him \"Well, they obviously liked me better, think of it! They brought me outside, they gave me bones and you are afraid of water!\". Whiskers anger grew even more \"Give me a goddamn break, you know why I don't like touching water, I don't like the feels of it on my paws!\" \"You always say that Whiskers!",
        "I turned the corner of my road, slipping in the snow and suddenly feeling the effects of the low-oxygen atmosphere at the top of Everest. \n\n\"Not again\". \n\nMy boss wasn't too happy when I called, I guess I'll need a new job now as well. It's frightfully cold up here, so I'm going to climb further up, that'll surely get me to the base camp. \n\nThe beach was nicer than the mountain at least, though I'm not sure when one became the other. The sand is warm, I've taken off my shoes and can feel it between my toes. I should find a telephone. I can see houses in the distance, but I have a good feeling about the other direction. I walked further along the beach, luckily I can see people. They're really big, all muscled and angry looking. It must be because of their physical work, they're all loading heavy bags of white powder into a boat. I waved hello and wandered down to see if I could help. \n\nI never made it there, down one dune, up another and there was the desert stretched out in front. That was a shame, those guys might have helped me. A soft idea started to bloom in my head. Like a bud bursting into shape, petals splayed out like the flower I saw last time I tried to go get my haircut. No giant wasps though, not this time; not in my head. \n\nI walked in the direction I thought was away from home, walking for hours until I'd built up quite a thirst. I stopped at one of the market stalls on the side of the busy road, bartering for a fruit juice. I wandered some more, through the dusty pyramids, empty damp temples and once through a round office with lots of shouting men. I'd almost given up on my plan when I'd finally returned home. \n\nI opened the front door, feeling the carpet beneath my toes with a simple joy. Maybe my next job shouldn't be so restrictive. Maybe a roving travel writer. I settled down into my chair waiting for the bit I liked least. The glowing cube floating down from its place on the shelf, the same creepy motion it's made since I could remember. The surface touching my forehead, connecting to my mind.",

        "*Notice: Any users mentioned within can ask me to remove them if they so desire. Yet I still think it would be rude. * \n\nWriting Prompts Incorporated,\"*We make your stories come to life! *\" is a booming business. Some bloke down on his life or up for a thrill submits a request for a story, the writers make it happen. The guy or gal who paid for it will go into through a door made with groundbreaking and unusual technology, and he or she will become whoever they would like to be in the story, an observer, the hero, the villain. If it is suitably popular it goes public and other people can try it out for a spin. Pretty good. Yet the stories almost always ends after about an hours worth of fun. The costumer goes home, forgets all his worries and such. The story is reset and a new person can try it out. It is good that it does, what is behind those doors are the other realities, when you enter in to that place you become part of the ride, and that is good. Yet Writing Prompts Inc. deals in many things, nightmares, perverse fantasies, dark desires as well as flimsy fantasies and lovely worlds of heroism and goodness. So when one day a clumsy worker forgot to close and reset a door properly, you could have hoped that it was the worlds made by a writer who was tasked with creating some utopia or a wonderful party. Unfortunately it was a door into an EU. \n\nThere are many types of requests, an EU is one where you get to enter into an original story for an established universe. And it just so happened that the one door that was opened was a door to an EU of Curious George where the titular character learns about something fun, you know, an EU for the kids. Yet the tiny ape escaped, and as curious as he was he activated a lot of other doors. And few of them good. The ape died when he opened a door into an EU about WH40K and was slaughtered by Space Marines, they then met the forces from a marching empire in an original story about space, and others yet zombies from a Apocalypse-Scenario. While the costumer is on the inside, they are guaranteed to survive, even if they die the story simply resets and they walk out the door. The opposite is not the case. \n\nAnd since things got heavy when Orcs from LOTR meet with sex-mad aliens from another dimension, when lord Eddard Stark comes marching out with an army only to meet with the forces of the living dead, that is where everything goes awry. And in the confusion and danger of it all, some people start noticing the war spilling into the streets from the Writing Prompts Inc. Dream Factory, the army got engaged. And the worst part is that some prompts are not meant to come out. Some doors lead to Cthulhu, others lead to things darker than that. Some leads to the end of all things. And one of those was opened. As the army bombed the factory, one last door was opened by a confused and scared cleaning lady who had been fleeing from sex-hungry fox-people before the bombing, the door contained something worse than warriors, more dangerous than zombies, more destructive than madness. It was a specially made prompt for the army, a battle simulation that would be able to test the toughest soldiers.",

In exchange, we would be rewarded with access to technology far beyond our own through trade, the customary 10 seats in the Parliament, and all but guaranteed military protection. \n\nIt had taken fourteen months to get Earth to this point. At first it had been easy - indie artists were easy to buy silence from. Web hosts blocked popular music streaming apps and scanned mp3s,.wavs, and other sound files. The more popular musicians fought back harder against the obtusely named Initiative for Intergalactic Peace and Quiet - the UN campaign to eradicate music. Records were destroyed, CDs were melted, Walkmans and iPods were steamrolled. Obstinate record executives were flung into the sun, teenage pop-stars' vocal cords were severed, Justin Bieber was personally immolated by the President on live TV. Nickelback played their final concert in the Large Hadron Collider. A smash hit. It was regrettably necessary for the survival of our race. The Republic had weapons the likes of which humanity had never seen, and they hated music. With a vengeance. \n\nSee, humanity wasn't too keen on wiping out a huge part of our culture, however imperative to our survival it was. Plans had been laid, machinations set into place, schemes schemed, and plots plotted. Favors were called in, hands were dealt and played, mail was blacked, and traps were laid. Behind the scenes, earth's scientists worked covertly to understand just why the aliens hated music so. There were some bio-chemical implications for some of the species, some behavioral impulse control in other species, but the reasons for this were murky at best. Humanity couldn't discern if music controlled them, or made them lose control - we weren't sure if it were an existential threat to the alien regime, or if it were a drug. \n\nWe didn't fully understand the War on Music. All we knew was that we thought the aliens would be unable to hold their Republic together if enough of them were exposed.",
        "When people ask me what I like most at my work I always answer \"The sound\" and everytime I get confused looks back. But that's what I'm expecting, because who would think of sounds when you talk about an art gallery? \n\nBut this is my gift, one reason why I am so good at my job, why I'm so enthusiastic about it. My favorites are the abstract paintings, colourfull, from calm to wild, with so many different possibilties. To a good painting I can listen for hours. Yes, listen. I hear colours. Brown has a dark timbre. Orange is a high screaming and pink is a set of soft strings. \n\nWhen I concentrate on a painting I hear nothing else. The song of this picture is everything I hear at that moment. You tell me where you want you picture and what kind of music you like, a question which startled a lot of my customers when they first come to me, and I can give you the perfect one for you. \n\nBecause I can see them.... because I can hear them.... and I love it, every day a little more.",

        "Susan always had a way with words. She was the type of writer who could give a semicolon a personality, she was that great! My arms and legs were riddled with scars, but her ebony skin had always been clean from marks. It's because she always had a way to tell the truth, but tell it in such a way that you wouldn't realize what she meant. \n\nFor example, one time she had forgotten to do her homework and when called on she sheepishly told the teacher that she hadn't figured out the problem. Not that she couldn't but simply that she hand't. \n\nWhen people asked her if they looked nice in particular clothes, she would either tell it straight or compliment individual features of the clothes- that girl was amazing! She helped me to get my way through school and taught me how to write better (hopefully it worked). \n\nSusan and I didn't speak for many years. During this time, I heard small whisperings that Susan wasn't doing well but that she wouldn't identify what was wrong, and weasel her way out of any scenario she found herself in by sheer tongue twisting. No one could figure out what was wrong. And her unmarked flesh became a sign of health to some, and a worry for others. \n\nThe last day I saw Susan, she made a fatal mistake. She mixed up her words, and lied. \n\nI was in town again for a New Year's party when I saw her familiar black hair through he crowd. I went to say hello and her appearance made me speechless. Her ebony skin had grayed out and her hair was thinner- even her once manicured nails were scraggly and unpolished. \n\n\"Susan, what's wrong?\" I asked. \n\nShe smiled wide, \"Why Martel, whatever would suggest that I am not alright?\" \n\n\"Well, your appearance.\" \n\nShe sighed, and looked back at me, \"Don't worry hon, I'll live.\" \n\nInstantly, the horror spread across her face alongside the scar across her back. It created a deep hollow from her back to just across her collarbone. The skin was crinkled and sore looking. \n\n\"I have to leave!\" She shouted. She bolted out of the room, her close friends chasing after her. \n\nThe next day I found out the news.",

I lay in the dark, scrolling through Reddit one last time. I want to check and see, maybe someone figured it out. But no. There are no new comments.... I'm alone and I have decided to escape the only way I can. I turn my music on, and lay in my bed, reaching for the pills I put as many as I can swallow in my mouth and take a drink. I do this three more times and then I wait. \nLaying there, feeling the pills start to drain my life, I suddenly hear a noise. Struggling I lift my head, and a face swims into view in front of me. I gasp and my eyes widen, it's harder to stay awake but I fight with all my strength. More faces come to view and I can hear them now. \"Where did she get the pills dammit?!\" \"I don't know, she has been acting out for days, clawing the windows and doors, screaming and crying out\" \"well go get the doctor now!\" \nI feel myself beginning to slip away as my mind try's to grasp what is happening, I can feel their hands on my, fighting for my life with machines, pumping my stomach.

        "Physical Attributes: This race is most similar to Earth's Jellyfish. They are dome shaped and have a body made of semi-porous rock encompassing a flexible membrane. (Imagine Drifblim from Pokemon had a kid with the Thing) These beings do not have eyes or any form of sensory organ similar to Earth creatures. They inhabit a gas giant planet, similar to Jupiter, and communicate using electrical impulses that travel through the gasses that encompass the surface of the planet. \nDespite sounding like rather primitive beings, they are able to communicate wholly and have developed a Monarchy-like society in which a select few govern over the rest. \n\nTechnology is in the form of circuits and is controlled in a manner similar to telepathy. As these beings use electrical pulses to communicate, they use these pulses to activate circuits in their machines and control them with their \"mind\" (quotes around mind as our concept of consciousness may be vastly different to theirs). \n\nCurrently they are having a good-ol' existential crisis. It seems that metal and machine components have been pulled in by their planet's gravitational pull. They can activate them, but they do not function in the same manner or for the same purpose as the machines they are accustomed to using. One machine seems to make an extension of the device rotate, they suspect it may be used for movement. Another piece emits a tone, they can not hear the tone, but can feel the waves pushing through their electrical pulses and through the gas around them.",
        "Aaron's legs were numb. The leather-bound swivel chair he sat in for eight hours a day gasped for air, and his computer screen daunted his already dry eyes. It was 3:28\u2014his pupils had a tendency to do laps with the second-hand of his watch for the last hour and a half of work. All day he heard mouse clicks, phone calls, and keyboards playing like a radio he wished he never bought. His eyes did another lap before closing for a slight second. What better time in the day for coffee than 3:30? \n\nHe let his chair breathe as blood rushed to his feet for the first time in what seemed like a year. His eyes now peered over the cubicles able to see the whole office, all seventeen workers, including his boss. Same people. Same spots. Every day. \n\nWith scolding hot coffee that had been sitting on the burner for too long in one hand, and a napkin for the predicted spillage in the other, he took the thirty-eight steps from the break room back to his cubicle. A five-foot by five-foot fortress built with flimsy walls and no privacy that he called his second home\u2014pathetic, really. When he returned, his chair took another gasp of air to last the remaining workday, and his legs began to deaden again as he leaned back in his seat. Cringing in pain at the first sip of coffee, he licked his lips and went to set it down next to his keyboard, when he noticed a slip of paper. \n\nWith a sore lip and wary hand, he picked up the sheet, glanced over his shoulder, and then began to read. \n\n> Dearest Worker, \n\n> How cowardly of me to leave a note instead of exchange a hand shake. My apologies. My name is insignificant to the events that will slowly unfold within the next hour and a half. All you really need to know about me is that I wrote this note for you\u2014only you.

        "\"Huh, always figured someone was watching me.\" Alex said when figuring out he was one of main characters of Perugini Paradise, a tv show that follows him along with his other family members (Perugini being his last name). \"I knew my life had to be interesting enough to make a tv show.\" Scrolling through the Alternate Universe's internet he found there were just as many fan fictions about his show as Harry Potter in his own. Scrolling through through the different titles he found one worth reading: \"Pokemon Yo\" \n\n\"You guys wan na walk to the breach way?\" Alex's cousins Mike asked looking up from his phone on the beach in Rhode Island. It was that time of year were the Peruginis take a family vacation to the beach during the month of July. \n\"I'm down.\" Said Chris, Alex's other cousin. \"I need to hatch some of my Pokemon eggs.\" Reaching in his pokepocket, Chris pulled out 3 small eggs in glass incubators. \n\"Roberto, hand me some of those Pokeballs.\" Nick, Alex's older brother, called to his other cousin. \n\"Sure thing.\" Roberto reached into one of the bags in between himself and his sister Lea to grab a handful of Pokeballs. \n\"Yo, it's lit.\" Said Matteo, Alex's youngest brother, as Roberto threw himself and Nick some balls. Walking past their dad and his friend Dan playing Kan Jam, they began their journey down the beach to catch'em all. \n\n\"It's not Staryu, it's Starme.\" Nick said as a joke a group of Starmes washed up on the beach. \n\"Pokedex says they're around 400 cp, better use some Razz berries.\" Alex said, throwing down some Razz berries for the Starmes to feed on.",
        "Some bystanders thought they were heroic, yet chosen to deny their ensuing pretentiousness. It was involuntary: the collective decisions that lead to the need to save what society would deem a fallen angel. A select few still felt a need to be a hero, rise above the other filth in the sty. Maybe life had some sort of sentimental value to those people, or maybe, charity was just a great ego-boost. It didn't matter in the end, though. The unsure appeals to hope and shout-outs to Christ, after the realization that they'd just fall on deaf ears, stopped. The misguided attempts would start up again, only to be drowned out by the random snippets of conversation by other passerby. \n\"JESUS! JUST FUCKING JUMP ALREADY IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN?\" Screamed an increasingly annoyed man, who was just trying to share his own shout-y version of the gospel a few minutes ago. \nThis sentiment was repeated, recited in the faces the gathering crowd. \nAs more and more time lapsed, the man's leather jacket became his only friend. The only thing protecting him from the howling wind that threatened his composure. \n\"Ah em.\" Clearing his voice: a strict juxtaposition to the uneasy silence. \nHe averted his eyes upwards towards a cloudy, gray sky\u2014yet somehow they still delighting in the nonexistent rays which burnt images and geometric patterns into his retinas. \n\"He said to them: Go!\" \nBottles of Blueberry vodkas and iPhones: were dropped for the first time. The whole herd rushed down the towards the water. Each, making a point of not getting too close to the man. The water soon became red, and he laughed as he walked back onto the bridge. \nOnce the job was done, he trudged along the middle of the road, knowing that no vehicle could hurt him. The man would slow his pace occasionally to scoff at the survivors, whose were maimed bodies wrapped around railings indicated an obviously desperate attempt to subvert the \"mind control.\" \n\"Please.... please...\" it trailed off, then rebounded...\" please...\" \nThe words were cut off, but he was sure the end was: \"kill me.\" \nThat cry resounded from every direction, inevitably dying out after some time.",
        "It is not easy to cut through a human head with a hacksaw. The blade binds and pinches and if you don't know where all the little bones come together you can get the blade stuck. The truth is it takes practice, everything does really but you never think about like that. \n\nThere is a trick though. There often is, once you've done a thing enough. the trick here was get a metal blade. Not metal but a blade for metal.

        "\"I'll meet you for coffee at our favorite cafe,\" Donna choked her words out through smoke damaged lungs, to her sister Katie, who checked her her phone again. \n\n\"Yeah, I'll tell Mom and Dad you died. See ya,\" Katie said as she placed her hand on her sister's burned-to-a-crisp arm and turned to leave. Katie had seen Donna die at least five times this year, and it was becoming a serious inconvenience. Katie had been called every time to identify the body or possibly speak to Donna before she died. It was always the same though, make sure her plants got watered, the cat got fed, and to meet at their cafe for coffee later. It was hard for Katie to keep her eyes from rolling when she heard Donna had slept with a cigarette and lit herself on fire. \n\nOn her way home from the dead body collection point, Katie walked past Ed the jumper. On the last Saturday of the month at approximately 6pm, Ed jumps from the highest bridge in Katie's town, falling face first into concrete. Katie once asked him why he did it and he explained that it was just time for him to be dead, like the old days, when people died forever. So he kept himself dead as much as possible by immediately killing himself when he was reborn. Over the years Katie noticed that while Ed's body repaired itself and looked to be functioning properly, he had become paler and more obsessed with being in his death state. Maybe the state of constant death was bad for Ed's mind. But Katie didn't dwell on that thought too much longer that, since Ed would be dead in two minutes anyways. \n\nKatie almost made it all the way home, until she remembered Donna's cat needed to be fed, those creatures died permanently if not cared for Katie remembered as she took a left down an ally next to her home. \n\n\"To die or not to die! This is your choice!\" A man yelled from a street corner as he waved fliers in Katie's direction. He shoved a pamphlet into her hands before she could object. The man walked quickly down the street with more pamphlets after a group of unsuspecting pedestrians. Katie was familiar people like him, the \"Cryo-nappers,\" a slang term for people who freeze themselves in a death like state for an extended period of time in hopes that death will be permanent again when they awake. Katie tossed the flier, she was pretty sure no one was working on a cure for their semi-perminent death state. Why would they? Death was the ultimate disease. It was cured. There was no undoing it, only living with it. \n\nKatie made it to Donna's apartment and stopped to text her parents: \n\n\"Donna died again.",
        "The awkward box shuffled beneath Jack's coat as he continued wandering through aisles with an empty stare. This would fall under either pride or envy, he thought. Juggling between the Big Seven, Sloth came in third. He had been meaning to read a book or two. Eventually -- when he found the time. He shrugged as he decided it didn't matter. Either he'd walk out this store a conceited, vain but dumb man or in handcuffs. Jack's history as an accidental shoplifter reached legendary status on a few occasions. \n\nHe couldn't shake the vision of his mother running a comb through her hair. Definitely blonde, golden even. Not so sure if it was as long as he remembered or had nostalgia turned it waist-length and curled? Things changed; peoples' attitudes changed. Their tastes never faded from fickle and cruel but that was towards other people. The guilt ran through him, *but towards other people* - as if that made it okay. \n\nSo he hadn't finished a crossword puzzle lately or voluntarily sat through a documentary. Using the word'eclectic' to describe his taste in music passed in online dating profiles and work lunches. No need to remind anyone he couldn't remember what it meant months after looking it up for the fourth time. His strong jawline and the dimple on his chin did the heavy lifting during bar crawls. Lately though, women craved depth, substance. Pulling it off with a headful of stark blond hair was impossible. The subtle hypocrisy of looking for something meaningful using the most superficial means made him smile. \n\nGoing to lengths to get laid wasn't new to mankind. Hell, the species practically relied on a man's ability to convince a woman of his suitability. So what if it wasn't always completely honest?

        "It was just so much easier then he had originally thought. Joe reflected how he just simply offered the hooker a drink, laced with rohypnol of course, and moved the limp unconscious body into his truck. He was driving to his private residence, deep in the sparsely populated backwoods of his town, where no one would disturb him. \n\nIn a way, Joe didn't want to do this, but he couldn't stop fantasizing the time he would spend with his new guest. In his lonely isolation, Joe lost touch with the world. He could never seem to socialize properly to get girls to like him. With his increasing age, and worsening appearance, Joe could not afford to wait any longer. And so, Joe had convinced himself that if they just could spend a little more time with him, one would perhaps fall in love with him. So he came up with a plan, he would kidnap girls he liked, and force them to stay with him. If they wanted out, if they could not eventually like him back, well, he obviously couldn't let them go to the police.... could he.... In any case, Joe was hoping that it did not have to come to that. The lonely truck turned onto the dirt path that would eventually lead to his home, not realizing that it was not as empty as he thought it was. \n\nJoe entered his residence. It was thoroughly cleaned up in preparation of his \"guest\". He had to make a good first impression after all. He laid the hooker.... no.... his female acquaintance, on the couch, and went to work on tying her hands and feet. Joe would not take the chance of his guest running away before he could properly introduce himself. \n\n\"Hey Joe,\" a voice said, in a calm and even tone, but startling Joe nevertheless. Turning around, he saw an old, but fit, bearded man sitting at his kitchen table. Frozen in shock, he just stared at the old man. Someone caught me? Already!? But I was careful! Do I kill him? Who else knows? Am I going to prison? \nThose were the thoughts that fired around in his brain. His body screamed action, but his mind did not know what to do. \n\n\"Listen to me very carefully,\" the old man said, again in a steady tone. Without an idea of what to do, Joe did just what the man said. \"I am you, from the future.\" The old man had a stern look in his eye. \"And what you are doing will never work.\" The old man began telling Joe, in detail, all the things that he did and would do. Joe had told no one of his desires, yet this old man knew every part of it. \n\nUpon hearing what the old man had to say, Joe realized that the old man was telling the truth. He saw himself, older yes, but strikingly close in resemblance. Joe could not say anything, he was dumbfounded. Stressed by the in-normality of the situation, Joe broke down. \n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" Joe whimpered, tears rolling down his face now. He was caught, and by his future self no less. The old man sat up and made his way toward his sobbing younger self. With a empathetic pat on the shoulder, The old man handed Joe a card. \n\n\"This was the place I went to when I realized what I've been doing, they're probably starting out now, but they really helped me see the wrong I had been doing.\" The old man had a solemn look on his face now, \"It was too late for the people I had hurt, but you still have a chance to make things right.\" \n\n\"What about her?\"",
        "So my friends and I kind of took this prompt and ran with it. We each wrote a section of each separate story and, well....it gets strange, hope you enjoy them! \n\nFIRST STORY \n\nWhen I came to, I was in what looked like the break room to an office building. In fact, it was my office building. That couldn't be though, the last thing I remember I was staring a semi-truck in the face. No, I was definitely dead, but could this really be heaven? I searched around and saw a pretty normal looking man in business casual dress at the water cooler. \n\u201c Hey, uh excuse me buddy, what-where uuuh- \u201c \n\u201c Oooh you must be the new guy, the head honcho said we was doing some training today.

And I'm afraid you're mistaken kid, this here is Hell. \u201d \n\u201c What?? You mean my religion wasn't the right answer? No, no I-I-I need to speak to the Devil at once \u201d \n\u201c Hahaha kid, you don't know where you are. You can't just go speak with the Head Honcho, the big cheese, the Heatmeister himself. You- hey where're ya going? \u201d \n\nI decided I'd had enough of that guy, I dealt with suck ups like him back on Earth and I wasn't about to let be the case here. I went to the directory and looked for his room number. Sixth floor, room sixty-six. Of course.

        "I'm getting sick of it. \n\nEvery time, every single time I get in this car, something ridiculous happens. I'm an honest man, trying to make an honest living, and I have to put up with this. For some reason, every hard-boiled detective, fugitive space warrior, and mobster-with-a-heart-of-gold chooses this cab. \n\nI'll be sitting there, waiting for a fare - a normal fare - and along they'll come. All I want is a nice old lady who needs to go to the shops, or a couple heading for the airport for a romantic break. But no - I get the secret agents with armoured briefcases, and plucky reporters who have a \"complicated\" relationship with a superhero. \n\nIt's all \"follow that car\" and \"step on it\", and then off we go on a ridiculous car chase. \n\nIn the past three weeks, I have driven through fourteen large barns, each time coming out surrounded by squawking chickens. I have jumped a missing section of road eight times. And I have been punched by a masked ninja standing on the hood of my car six times. The doctor says my nose will never fully straighten. \n\nIt's not good for my blood pressure, I can tell you. Every day is another high-speed race through downtown Tokyo, or Megacity Prime. I don't know how we get there - I live in Bradford. Yet suddenly, we'll turn a corner and be speeding through some high-tech hellscape in a hover car. \n\nAnd it's never a peaceful place, either. The most relaxing so far was a mountain road - I think it was the Swiss Alps, or somewhere. Lovely scenery. But two minutes after we get there, I'm having to swerve to dodge rockets and accelerating full tilt at a Nazi helicopter. The square-jawed fella in the cowboy hat wasn't helping, either - he kept shouting at me to \"hold her steady\" while he lobbed grenades and flirted with some Russian bird. \n\nI'm alive, so far. I've been shot at, stabbed, set on fire by a terminator. Pre-cognitive cops shot out one of the tires, and I ended up with whiplash. Whiplash that is never going to heal if I keep on ending up in hansom cab on the trail of the Gang of Four. \n\nNerves of steel, I'm telling you. That's what you need to have. And I've been trying to develop them, but it's hard to build your courage when you are constantly scared shitless. I thought I had a handle on it, but then it was all \"Red Leader, standing by\", and I was hurtling towards something that definitely wasn't a moon in a giant letter. The git in the back's constant beeping was not an aid to my concentration. \n\nIt doesn't even pay that well. Every time the journey finishes, all I get is a handful of money and a gravelly \"keep the change\". Half the time, it's not even legal tender - it'll be a bunch of Imperial credits, florins, or conflict diamonds. What am I meant to do with them? And even when it is real, modern money, it's never enough. Not for the journey, and the petrol (do you have any idea how much starship fuel costs?), and the cleaning fees. You try getting pterodactyl blood out of a grille without professional help. \n\nI thought it was too good a deal to be true. \u00a3300 for a car - in good working order - with one careful owner and all the modern conveniences. Nobody mentioned that it would send me all over time and space to be shot at by aliens and savage tribesmen.

Even her kids have taken her cue and have settled a little. \n\n\n*Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling \"Yoo-Hoo! \"* \n\n\"Mommy, why are you humming a Christmas song,\" her little girl asked. \"It's June!\" \n\n\n\"You know sweetie, I have no idea.\" \n\n\n*Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. *",
        "For the past week, I've been staring at my phone and wishing it would make some kind of noise. A text, phone call, I'd even take one of those damn annoying amber alert system messages. I can't stand the silence, I can't stand being in the dark. Your pictures still haunt me on Facebook. \n\nYour smile, the little dimple on your left cheek that only showed up when you were truly happy. I lived for that dimple. It's strange, we complain about people putting too many photos online, but that changes when the person is gone. Now, I am asking myself why we didn't take more pictures together. Why we didn't ever follow through on our plans \n\nWe were all talk. \n\nAnd now your parents made me come to this stupid party. \"It'll make you feel better!\" They told me. What they really meant was, \"It'll make *us* feel better.\" And that's fine. They've been great this past week and I don't mind being the strong one on the outside. I don't mind being the one who acts like there is nothing wrong. \n\nBut on the inside, I am dying. The pain just gets worse the closer it gets to midnight. Fuck, I really don't want to do this. I don't want to scream, \"HAPPY NEW YEAR!\" and then turn around to kiss someone who is not there. I don't want to go home to an empty house. \n\n\"Thirty seconds left! Here we go!\"",
        "\"Hey, there's something I wanted to try out...\" \n\nI raised my eyebrow and turned to face her: \n\n\"Again already? Well, I'm not exactly in shape right now, but what's on your mind?\" \n\n\"Not that, silly,\" she punched me playfully. \"I wanted you to.... you know.... read me.\" \n\nMy face instantly went red, as I scrambled up in bed. \n\n\"Hey! Don't joke like that!\" \n\n\"Who said I was joking?\" she raised her voice. \"How can you be such a prude after *that*?\" \n\n\"Th-that's different.\" I started rubbing my forehead. \"That's physical.\" \n\n\"So it was just physical for you!?\" \n\n\"You know that's not what I meant!\" \n\nShe smiled. \n\n\"Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. It's just such a turn on: to be completely exposed to someone you love, to know that they can hear your every thought, every little worry, every silly thing that pops into your head. And the fact that it's such a taboo doesn't help either.\" She looked up at me, blushing a bit herself. \"Do you think I'm weird?\" \n\nI sighed. \n\n\"Yes, and that's why I like you.\"",
        "\u201c I'll give you some time to think about this, alone. \u201d the employer said, as he walked out of the room closing the door behind him. I sat at the table with many thoughts running through my head. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity and all I had to do was sign the contract. \n\n\u201c We can make this decision quick. \u201d the devil said, making himself visible on my right shoulder. \u201c Sign the contract. Isn't this what you've always wanted? \u201d \n\nI began to think of all the opportunities that would open up for me. \n\n\u201c Yes! \u201d I shouted. \u201c I'd be able to finally put my work out there for the world to see! \u201d \n\nThe devil began to laugh. \u201c Yes, yes. Now, tell the employer you're ready to sign. \u201d \n\n\u201c What good would this be? \u201d the angel said, as she too made herself visible but on my left shoulder. \u201c What would you really get in exchange? \u201d \n\nThe angel also had a good point. I mean, the contract was mediocre. The job also required so much out of me. Not to mention I would no longer be able to share the last days with my mother who had become very ill with little chance of survival. \n\n\u201c Guys, I don't know what to do! \u201d I began to talk fast. Anxiety had begun to set in. \u201c I can't just leave my mother now. Oh but the money I can make so much and I - \u201d \n\n\u201c Sorry I took so long. \u201d Abruptly, I stopped talking as the employer emerged from the opening door. The angel and the devil became invisible. It was now time to make that decision.",
        "\"10, 56, 27, 9, 27, and\u2026 41! \u201d \n\nPatrick O'Witty held the coffee-stained lottery ticket in a quivering hand, his red-rimmed eyes staring at the flickering television screen in utter disbelief. His eyes began to itch and burn when he realized he hadn't been blinking. He checked the numbers several times, certain he was mistaken. The numbers on those silly white ping pong balls inexplicably lined up with the ticket in his hand. The audience on the television applauded and the host displayed a collection of pristine, gleaming teeth as he smiled at the camera. \n\nHe won. \n\nPatrick O'Witty was a billionaire. \n\nHis heart began to race as he reverently set the small paper on an end table, his mind struggling to comprehend what was happening. A burning mixture of anxiety and glee made him light-headed. Luck had finally turned in his favor. \n\nRecovering from a terribly unfair divorce settlement, Patrick struggled to make ends meet. He had been working double shifts at Weinmeier's, a local grocery store chain that had been slowly but steadily growing. Paul Reichart, the assistance produce manager, had been selected to head their new store over in Boughtown. That left an open promotion and Patrick knew he was the favorable selection. \n\nHe wouldn't need that anymore. \n\nHe'd never worry about money again. \n\nIt only took one week for Patrick O'Witty to realize that sudden and incredible wealth isn't what he thought it would be. \n\nThe phone was ringing again. \n\n\u201c Hullo? \u201d \n\n\"Pat? \u201d the voice sounded slightly muffled and entirely unfamiliar. \n\n\u201c Yeah? \u201d he rubbed his throbbing temples with an unsteady hand. \n\n\u201c Pat! My God, it's good to hear your voice! It's your cousin, Tamara! \u201d Patrick couldn't confirm or deny if he even had a cousin named Tamara. \n\nHe hadn't heard from any of his family in over a decade, yet the past week had the phone ringing off the hook with aunts, uncles, second-cousins, twice and thrice removed. He did a little googling but still didn't understand what that meant. \n\nPatrick set the phone down gently on the cradle as the excited voice jabbered on the other end. He'd been warned this might happen, and he had tried to prepare himself for it. The sudden barrage concerned family only accentuated the loneliness that had consumed his life for so long. \n\nHe winced as an authoritative knocking suddenly struck his front door. A strange social anxiety had made an unwanted appearance in those gloomy days. Frequent visitors and press came to his home to offer their hollow congratulations on his near record-breaking jackpot win. He sat behind curtained windows, pretending he wasn't home, visibly cringing until the knocking ceased and the unwelcome guests went away. \n\nHe shot a glance at the red polo shirt that hung on an arm chair in the darkened living room, forgotten. \u201c Weinmeier's Grocery \u201d was proudly embroidered on the breast pocket along with an assortment of colorful fruit.",
        "He reaches back to feel it again. \nStill there. \nHe ties his shoes. \nHe adjusts his tie in the mirror. \nHe touches it again. \nStill there. \n\nA small round knob, barely the size of a thimble, protrudes from his neck just above his snow-white collar. \nHis inner monologue races. \"How long has it been there? Should I see a doctor? Does everyone have one? Impossible, I would have noticed. But I just noticed mine. Can everyone see it?\" \nHe touches it again, still there. \n\nBarry Roper, the average height and slender, quiet, shy, clumsy, and most notably unlucky man is taking his chance today. He loathes his days emptying the trashcans along the residential neighborhoods. He is unsatisfied with his constant state of financial desperation. Renting a small studio apartment, perpetually drowning in stress, anxiety that the next time he turns his car key nothing will happen. Barry is not satisfied, and he finally dug up the courage to do something about it. \n\nBarry's true passion is cards. Texas Holdem and Pot limit Omaha, he never misses a televised high stakes game. He dreams of building a bankroll and taking it to Vegas. When anyone mentions the greatest players of all time, his name will come up. When he sits at a table a crowd will gather. Only the most courageous or foolish players will remain seated. But beginning that journey wouldn't happen today. Only two days ago the casino posted an add looking for dealers. Good dealers make good money. With all of his practice pitching cards alone in front of his television, watching old tapes of poker world championships, Barry was a good dealer. \n\nThen, this morning, the dial appeared. Barry twisted his back and leaned into the mirror to get a better look. White lines, raised like scars, wreathed the brassy knob. Alternating lines were marked with a digit increasing in value going clockwise around the peculiar blemish beginning with 0 near the eight o-clock position. Barry stretched his torso to the left; The numbers ended at 16 on the other side. Straining to see it clearly from the corner of his vision, just above the knob sat a triangle pointing at the number seven. \nThe mouse of a man gingerly caressed the newly discovered anatomy, feeling the cold hard shell. He tugged it gently. Like tugging his own ear, he knew it would not be removed painlessly. \n\nThoughts raced in Barry's mind. \"What are the numbers? What will happen if I turn it? will it even turn? Maybe it's just an odd mole and I'm just imagining things. Stress and nerves. That's what it is.\" \nHe couldn't resist.",
        "I see the blinding lights of the headlights through the dark stormy atmosphere. With a loud pound of the car and the crack of my body I felt the hard metal impact my small weak body yet felt little pain. I cant feel pain when im in this state of mind, a positive of this affliction. I lay on the cold hard wet road while my life slips away slowly I fade out into darkness my breathing slows to a shallow breath as the ambulance siren in the background muffles more and more. \n\nSuddenly my eyes open partially, I can breath again. I look down im sitting on somthing soft and comfy and white. My torn dirty old clothes are now skinny jeans and black converses, like the ones I wore throught highschool. As my vision gets better I can see that Im sitting on a small bed in a blue bedroom decorated with trophies and awards. I can hear loud muffled music playing in the background and people talking. I get overwhled with dejvu, I cant put my finger on it. I look across the room and see my ex husband seemingly a decade younger acrose the room in a seperate similar looking bed with his eyes closed. Somthing looks diffrent about him. \n\nAs I look closer I notice gone are the dark circles around his eyes scabs on his face and arms. He looks sober and healthy a sight I havent seen in about 12 years. He notices me looking up at him gets up off the bed and walks over.",
        "I was stunned. That apparition's proposal seemed simply too good to be true. Doubt \u2013 or maybe it was skepticism \u2013 crept into my mind, churning away at the potential \u2026 and the risk. \u201c You mean to tell me, you will grant me one \u2013 just one wish \u2026 anything I want? \u201d \n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nThe apparition nodded, thin lips curling into a charming wry grin \u2013 too charming. \u201c That's about the size of it, mortal. \u201d He answered. His words echoed through my consciousness \u2013 a graveled, singsong tenor \u2013 as if every syllable hinted of Damocles. \n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c But at what cost? \u201d I asked, turning my attention to the brass vessel from whence he came, taking refuge from his countenance in the filigree etched into its contours. In those etchings I found some odd sense of peace. When I returned my attention to the apparition, he merely shrugged. \n\u201c None that I could hold over you, mortal. \u201d Once the wish is made, I'll hold no power over you. From there, what you make of your wish is up to you. \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Right \u2026 I'd like a do-over, then. I want to go back and change my greatest mistake. \u201d \nThe apparition sighed, eyes rolling as he ran his fingers through his hair. \u201c Are you sure, mortal? Is that all you want? \u201d He paused, shaking his head. \u201c No riches? No power? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nI shook my head. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Knowledge? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Not even women? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Men? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c Neither. \u201d I answered. \u201c I just want to go back and correct my biggest mistake. \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nAgain the apparition sighed, shoulders slumped in resignation. \u201c Very well, mortal \u2026 your wish is granted. \u201d \nIn an instant, my world was consumed by light. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nSomething about this seemed all too familiar. I was stunned of course. The apparition's proposal seemed simply too good to be true. \u201c You mean to tell me, you will grant me one \u2013 just one wish \u2026 anything I want? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\nThe apparition nodded, thin lips curling into a charming wry grin \u2013 too charming. \u201c That's about the size of it, mortal. \u201d He answered. His words echoed through my consciousness \u2013 a graveled, singsong tenor \u2013 as if every syllable hinted of Damocles. \nSomething about his words send a chill down my spine. \u201c D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u201d I muttered, thrusting my hands in my pockets as I looked away. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c What was that? \u201d The apparition demanded. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c This all just feels familiar. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. \u201d At that, he just laughed. \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c What? What's so funny? \u201d \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c You begin to see, mor\u2014 \u201c \n\n\n\n& nbsp; \n\n\n\u201c ALBERT! My name is Albert, not \u2018 mortal.'\u201d The apparition clutched his belly in uproarious laughter, speaking through gasps and snorting chortles as he attempted to collect himself. \u201c I know \u2013 you've told me! \u2013 HA! More than once!",
        "I had always felt passion but was never molded by it. The blood is burning my eyes now. My rage has defined me. A tangy mix of blood and sweat is beginning to fill my mouth. I found the edge and tossed myself across what was once a defined line in my mind. The pain is real. My hands feel deformed, alienated from the rest of my body. They have always been this way. They never needed me, they always knew what to do. I feel alive..... I feel. Where is the laughter the joy? In the moment of my epiphany I feel no joy? I realize now I have been forcing the emotion all along. This is who I am, this is what defines me. I can feel myself seizing, shaking, filling with rage. I growl from the deepest parts of my soul. The sound bellows from my body to a wicked tune. I feel better, I do it again cracking the silence in the room again with the sound. The blood is drying and beginning to stick to my face. The damp sleeve of my arm motions to rub against my eyes. I can fucking see. The room is still as dark as I left it. I can feel my pupils shifting into the darkness. My hand are crafting something beautiful I can feel it. The stone floor fills the room first. I can see it sprawling the floor with its cold glow. My hands shift carefully crafting my art. I feel alive, My soul wants to scream. I want to yell but all I hear is laughter. The laughter is filling the room, bouncing off the walls. The laughter is breaking my silence. The laughter is breaking my mind. How did I get here? What is happening? My eyes are focused now, I can see now what my hands have been doing. A masterpiece indeed. This guy had the wrong idea. He thought he was going to teach me a lesson. I want to scream but my mind only laughs at my attempt. He should have never come in here. He should have left me alone. I want to scream but the fucking laughter is too loud now. The door is moving, I cant stop laughing. A shadow is moving towards me I clench the fragment of bone from the prisoners jaw and move into the shadow. I press my weight behind my thrust as to pass the bone through the shadow to stop its presence in the room.",
        "*The weight of her body in his arms was all Jack could think about. He was so happy she was alive. This moment was all that mattered. He looked Tiffany in the eyes and said \"Hey Tiff, you know what I want to change about this moment?\" A smile crept up on her face and she asked \"What?\" he quickly responded: \"Nothing! I would change nothing about this moment.\" She laughed and leaned into his chest* \n\n\"Really dude? I mean come on, you wouldn't change anything at all? You've known this girl for what, 8 months? You're fucking 29 years old and now this girl's existence is your primary source of happiness?

You got ta narrate this stuff right!\" \n\"Yea whatever, Bill. Serves him right.\" \n\n*As Jack leaned forward to nuzzle his head into Tiffany's hair, he suddenly felt uncomfortable. ``.... Damn. Am I a giant cunt?\" he thought to himself. \"What's wrong Jack?\" Tiffany said as she leaned her head down to his lap and looked up at him. \"Oh nothing, what do you mean?\" he asked. \"I don't know, you seemed distracted for a minute...\" she said as she touched her finger to his chin. He just smiled and kissed her. He always like the little bump on her bottom lip that she had from cutting it when she was a child. Her tongue fluttered into his as she took a deep breath. His breathing quickened as he thought tonight might be night that they make love. * \n\n\"Wait what. Bill, you mean to tell me this fucking guy hasn't banged this broad and he's already quoting that line from Talented Mr. Ripley when Matt Damon is trying to bang that dude on the boat?

        "*** [ EU ] Fallout Universe. *** \n\n\"Everyone good? Sound off\" Paladin Daemus' voice echoes across the dusty corridor. \n\n\"Liam, here\" Liam is the Heavy gunner, the ammunition mule. \n\n\"Joyce, here\" Joyce is the only initiate in the task force who filled in last minute due to an injury of another task force member right before deployment. \n\n\"Halter, here\" Halter is the team technician, he is key to this mission's success. \n\nSilence ensues the next couple of seconds after Halter sounds off. \n\n\"Clark, are you there?\" Daemus says. He receives no reply. \n\nHalter uncovers Clark's corpse, his armor was heavily dented and was blasted inward to his ribcage. \"Clark's gone.\" \n\n\"Well, Shit. Get his holotags and lets push onwards\" \n\n\"Sir Daemus\" Initiate Joyce yells out, as her ears are still ringing. \"Is this gold still worth it?\" \n\n\"This isn't about treasure hunting, Joyce. We're doing this for the good of the brotherhood. Not only will it help us gain wealth in terms of material standards, but in here lies the entire digital copy of the national archives.\" \n\n\"But sir,\" Joyce rebutts \"We've already lost 5 men. We're not even sure if-\" \n\n\"We will PUSH ON, That is an order.\" Daemus yells out as the ceiling crumbles fine dust down to the floor, illuminated by the dying light of one of their flares. \n\nHalter finished stripping down Clark's body of any useful supplies, Ammunition, Stimpaks and his holotags. \n\n\"Halter, throw in another flare, down the hall, and we'll keep on moving.\" \n\nAs the flare Halter lit slides across the end of the corridor and into an intersection, the hallway is suddenly lit up with gunfire, and darkens again when the flare was put out by lead. \n\n\"Goddamnit, there's another fucking turret in the corner.\" Liam exclaims. \n\nThe group huddles near the corner where they suspect the turret to be. Liam throws a pulse grenade. A small explosion is heard, but the sound is dwarfed by the whizzing of electricity. \"Is it out?\" Joyce asks. \n\nLiam pulls out his gun and waves it in front of the turret. No response. \"It's down.\" \n\nAfter they pass the labyrinth of corridors inch by inch, meeting turret resistance along the way, they manage to enter the grand entrance. \n\n\"That should be it, sir. The vault is down the hall.\" Halter says with relief. \"The turrets in this room seem to be down, Probably linked to a different mainframe or something.\" \n\n\"Lets move then, slowly and quietly. This part will likely be rigged. Watch for any pressure plates.\" Daemus says, worried of possible traps that still work 200 years after the war. \n\nThey manage to reach the other side of the room with no resistance at all. The whole team lets out a sigh of relief, their mission is almost over. Before them stands the door of a great vault, similar to those vault shelters that litter the wasteland of post-apocalyptic america. But this one is bigger, sturdier. Inside it is the gold reserves of a once powerful nation, but more importantly, the knowledge of the old world. \n\n\"Halter, check the terminals, see what you can do about opening the doors, if we can't, we may have to blast through one of the walls.\" \n\nAs Halter gets on a terminal, he begins overriding the system, trying to find a way to open the vault. The eerie quietness of the underground complex is almost deafening. With only Halter's keystrokes and Liam's heavy breathing to break the silence. The room is almost pitch black, if it weren't for the faint emergency lights flickering across the room and the green glow of the terminal that Halter is hacking.",
        "Secret agents are people, too. \n\nFew understand the depths of boredom that comes with serving in a secret organization. A key component of being recruited is your appearance, namely that you don't stand out in a crowd and have all of the'common feature' traits without any identifying marks of any kind. You are then disappear from society and do everything you can to not get a wound on any part of your body that's normally visible. \n\nSeriously, they put padding on your shower head. \n\nIt doesn't help that whoever thinks of themselves as the interior decorator of these agencies thinks that grey is an exciting color. If I were to go color blind one day I'd never notice. \n\nOne of the few graces we are allowed, as agents, is to ability to pick our code-words. Someone actually grasped the concept that being able to understand each other when speaking into the tiniest microphones in the world over the weakest wireless network in the world was important to do our jobs. \n\nA lot of our spare time is spent talking to each other inside of sound-proof boxes and finding out how often we misunderstand each other. Only the phrases and terms that have at least a 99.7 % success rate are allowed as valid code-words. \n\nTrust me, it takes a LOT of whispering into a tiny microphone to reach a number where 99.7 % is a valid measurement. \n\nNaturally, we tend to start with realistic statements that would actually make sense if someone were to over-hear: \"I wonder if I left the oven on.\" or \"Shit, there's Miranda, she looks hot tonight.\" It's really quite remarkable how having a diverse set of regional accents can mess up perfectly legitimate phrases when heard with a sound quality that of gargling marbles while drowning in pancake batter. \n\nSo you see, \"Thank god\" became our term for \"Extreme danger\" and \"Full of spiders\" became out term for \"is looking towards the entry door.\"",
        "*You have been found worthy. * \n\nI entered through simple glass doors, and encountered something I'd never come across in my life. It was a hall, lined with weapons leading off into Eternity; a never-ending misperspective, mocking my mere humanity. \n\nImmediately to my left, a thin blade, barely the width of my thumb, lodged into an obsidian stone. To my right? The legendary weapon *Masamune*, as wielded by the nemesis Sephiroth from the game *Final Fantasy VII*. So, it continued onwards, the weapons singing their hymnal call. \n\nBut not for me. My path lay in vengeance, and I feared that I was disallowed from all of the weapons.The chorus of metal and wood sang, louder and more vicious with each step. I had barely spent a minute wandering that infinity, when....silence. Like a library. \n\nA clarion call, in quadruple harmony. **You are mine, Singer. I shall reveal myself to you momentarily. ** I stood, wondering what would happen, when merely the impossible did - the hall shrank, the weapons chanting. *An-ka-hei-la, An-ka-hei-la, An-ka-hei-la-an-ka-HEI! * # \n\nA solemn silence. A pedestal. Vengeance. Solemnity. A glimmer. Blindness. \n\n....And there it was, a small dagger, golden in appearance, entwined within it, a crystal grip and hilt. The gold shone, with a fire within it that was unsated, covered with the dust of aeons, from a time and a place that was a part of the kingdom of the Could-have-been King and the deadly court of the Knight of the never-weres.",
        "\"well, what's so different about it that we can't just use any sensation?\" The woman in a tweed jacket asks. She sits across our conference table, with her beady eyes and judging lips. Their always like this. Every time a new mayor is elected, they come to me to ask where their power comes from. What naive children. Lessons must be learned the hard way. \n\n\"Other sensations are mediated by larger and more.... secure axons in our body. Their transmission from source of sensation to the spinal column is much more rapid than the transmission of pain,\" explaining this to the mayor while containing my contempt is a trial in of itself, but it is what I am here for. Previous mayors were happy enough to seat in their office and reap the rewards of their position without action. \"When a splinter enters your foot, which do you feel first? The grain of the wood or the throbbing of split skin?\" I pause to let her think. \"Pain is delayed. Much easier to tap into\" \n\n\"If that is the case, that you're tapping into the neurons, why can't you just give them an anesthesia so they don't feel the pain,\" A logical question, I wasn't expecting that. \n\n\"Anesthesia blunts the transmission before it reaches the only probe site we can use; it would ruin the whole process. The subject must be awake and feeling everything,\" A quick lie. I've become very efficient. \n\n\"That's.... Unfortunate...\" She doesn't enjoy this truth, she's hesitant. It's working out as before; perfect. \n\n\"Would you like to see one of our chambers? Theoretically explaining the process is wonderful, but I believe that the process must be seen to understand why we must do what we do for the benefit of our immense energy needs,\" I state. She goes pale, but nods her head. I lead her through our multitude of passage ways, all plain and with no windows. \"As you can see, we are not the torture houses of yore. We do not keep our subjects in squallier. It would serve no benefit to us to have them uncomfortable between sessions,\" she nods along with my explanation. We stop before a door marked'Observation Room A' \n\n\"I'm not so....\" \n\n\"Come now, you must understand how necessary this is. It would be a disservice to your office for you to be ignorant.\" \n\n\"I.... You're correct,\" she stands up a little more straight. As we enter the room, all colour leaves her face. The observation room is small, with a large window into the next room. A technician stands to one side of the other room, wearing a white garb and protective gear. Beside him, a table with knives, pliers, saws, and needles. In the center of the room, the subject is dangling from the ceiling, arms chained to opposing walls. His feet barely touch the floor. A multitude of wires run from his back to the wall. His head seemed limp, but tears streamed down to his chest. Incisions were made across his body. \n\n\"As you can see, we have in inserted probes into each ganglion root. 48 in total. Those intercept the pain response and creates the energy we need. We remove the tongue and larynx to keep the noise levels down as well. We do that after we insert the probes, no wasted energy here,\" I smile at her. \n\n\"This.... This is sick...\" She's reeling, holding back her gag reflex. \n\n\"Yes, but necessary. Need I remind you that without us, the city would be without power to keep the citizens placated.\" \n\n\"We have to find another way, this is disgusting.\" \n\n\"I'm not sure that another way is out there. We no longer have fossil fuels, the winds are not strong enough around us, and we don't get enough sun. Until we have a better energy source, this is our only option.\" \n\n\"I'll find another option,\" she raises her head and stares direct at the man. Some colour has returned to her face as she turns to me, her eyes unyielding.",
        "I am drunk, and beyond tired. Or I was drunk. Sobering up now. Not in a good way. Not in a feeling like I was before I got drunk way, but in a feeling considerably worse than when I started kind of way. I have to be at work in an hour. If I shut my eyes now, I don't know when they'd open. I look into my bathroom mirror. \n\nJesus Christ. I must have thrown up so hard I broke blood vessels in one of my eyes. The left one. No, the right. A mirror image is reversed, right? Or is that a camera thingie? Maybe I am still a little bit drunk. And my left or right eye looks like someone painted the white part over with red. \n\nI can do this. Need to energize. I run cold water and start splashing it on my face. Good. I can feel a tiny jolt of life returning. Music! I fumble with my phone, and start playing something from a playlist. Shit. It's some sappy love song I downloaded back when I broke up with what's her name. The one with the lip tattoo. Oh well, I'll just play it really loud. \n\nCold water on the face. Check. Music blasting. Check. I know. Action movie kung fu Matrix sound effect punches. I pick up my jacket from the floor. I put it on. The sleeves are what make this possible. The sound effects. Remember that scene from the Matrix where Neo's blocking all those punches, and dude is punching super fast? I start doing that, the super fast punches, getting the adrenaline flowing. Punching fast in every direction. Making swoosh noises from my sleeves. \n\nI punch my shower curtain. Somehow it's more solid than I realized. And it screams. \n\n\"Fuck!\" \n\nI pull back the curtain, and see a naked man huddled in the corner of my tub. He's holding his nose, and blood is streaming down. I'm way too tired to run. \n\n\"Hey, why are you in my shower?\" \n\n\"I lost my keys earlier\", he says, \"and I just opened the door to this apartment. To see if there was a phone. So I could call for a ride. My friend! So I could call my friend for a ride!\" \n\n\"That doesn't make sense. You're completely naked, and in my shower. What are you doing?\" \n\nHe moves his hand away from his nose, and that's when I realize it's me. It's me from ten years ago. What the fuck? \n\n\"Hey, you're me. You're like 25 year old me. What the fuck are you? Ghost of Christmas Past or something?\"",

You must be stuck in the past thinking N'Sync is better, LAWL.\" \n*Fuck! Don't go Old Testament on her ass, please don't be Old God. Be young, cool, hip God. In with the times, that's me.

        "Ben felt the impact of the large mans fist as it collided with his jaw. These guys had been working him for five hours straight. His mouth tasted like blood, he couldn't see out his right eye, and he was pretty sure at least two of his ribs were cracked or broken. He spat out a mix of blood and saliva and righted his head to look at his interrogator in the eye. \n\n\"The last guy hit harder, and he hit like a bitch. Who taught you how to punch?\" \n\nAnother punch sent his head flying the other way. Little bits of lights clouded his vision and he could hear a ringing in his ears. Sure it hurt but he'd been through worse back home. He shook his head slightly and rolled his tongue around the inside of his mouth. \n\n\"No, see, you have to turn your hip into it. You can't just punch like that.\" \n\nThis was the fourth guy they'd sent in to interrogate him. The first guy tried to be \"civil\" and would try to coerce him into talking by promising him food, a better cell, and no more beatings. Ben not only laughed at the proposal, he also bit the guys ear off when he got to close. After that was when the real fun started. They hit Ben with clubs, shocked him, tried to suffocate him, but to no avail. Now he was dealing with a gorilla of a man who looked like he was more muscle than sense. The guy was winded, his knuckles were red and swollen, and the whole time he was trying to get Ben to talk, Ben was just making him angrier. The brute put his hands on his knees and took in a couple of deep breaths. Ben could see the sweat on the guys forehead and arms. \n\n\"Oh what, are we taking a break? Is it time for tea? Do you want to go go lie down for a nap? It's no big deal, I'm tied up at the moment as it is, I can wait.\" \n\nThe big guys head snapped up. His eyes were filled with rage. He reared back and prepared to throw a right straight at Ben's face. Ben leaned his head forward to meet the fist halfway. His attackers fist met with the top of Ben's head. Ben heard the audible crack of bones breaking. The giant man reared back, clutching his right hand. \n\n\"Oh my bad, did I break your hand? Sorry about that pal. Sounds painful.\"",
        "Elmer had uncovered another one of the strange temples. This one was in the middle of the Dessert of Atlanta. The temples where simple, giant boxes. Filled with giant monoliths and strange tubes. Elmer said that these were temples of knowledge, commerce, and communication. The ancients did everything at these temples. \n\nAfter clearing the trees and growth out of the way, we found the door. It was a small gray one-person door. \n\n\"If these temples were as important as you say, how could everyone get in an out through such a small door?\" I asked. \n\n\"Nobody actually went to these temples. Only a few monks who cleaned them and maintained them.\" Elmer said. \n\n\"You said they did everything at these temples? They traded, they learned, they taught. How did they do that without coming to them?\". I was having a hard time understanding Elmer. He was very smart, but sometimes he didn't make sense. \n\n\"I'm not exactly sure, but I think they had little shrines in their house, or prayer books. They used the shrine through those.\" He said. \n\n\"I thought you didn't believe in magic.\" I retorted. He didn't reply. \n\nI used an axe to break the lock on the door. Elmer told me this was the largest temple he had ever seen. There had to be thousands of the monoliths. Each of the monoliths had about fifty drawers on the front, and a small symbol on the front of each drawer. \n\nWe went to the back of the temple. There was a giant tank next to a strange looking machine. Elmer said that if we could make the machine work, the temple would become active. He shook the tank, it was filled with a foul smelling liquid. He pulled a crank on the machine. It made a loud growling sound, but then it sputtered and stopped. After he twisted some nobs on the machine and pulled the crank again, the machine started growling again and it didn't stop. \n\nThe monoliths lit up as if there were hundreds of fireflies on each of them. We went to a small room off to the side of temple. In this room there where small shrines, with dark pieces of glass, windows to nowhere, sitting on top of each of them. Elmer said the monks that lived here, called \"techs\", would use these pieces of glass to see what was happening in the temple. \n\nElmer pushed a button on one of the shrines. He started touching some strange jewels on it.",
        "Jasper screamed as a red hot poker was shoved into his eye socket by a giggling imp. The eye grew back a second later, to allow for further torturing. \n\n\"Hey Bruce,\" Jasper called to the guy who was being roasted on a spit to his left. \"You ever think you might - AAAAAARRRRGH - be going to Hell when you die?\" \n\n\"Huh. No way, man,\" said Bruce, straining his neck back to look at Jasper. \"I've been a good victim. I'm definitely getting the nice treatment when I shuffle off.... I hear in heaven they only torture you for one hour a day.\" \n\nJasper looked downcast. Then he screamed again as the poker was shoved somewhere unmentionable. \n\n\"What's eating you, man?\" asked Bruce, looking concerned. \"Other than those death termites on your leg, obviously, hah.\" \n\n\"I don't know. Sometimes it's just, I worry....what if I haven't been good enough? What if I end up going to - AAAAARGH FUCK FUCK FUCK - hell?\" \n\n\"Shouldn't worry about that, mate,\" said Bruce, kindly, even though most of his larynx was on fire and it was difficult to hear him. \"Hell's probably just made up to scare people.\"",
        "All my life people have tried to kill me. It all stopped 1916. I got some condolence cards informing me that a certain Adolf Hitler died in the trenches. I never knew the guy but I was sure happy the attempts on my life ended. On the positive side this turned me into a hard to kill son of a bitch with a deep dislike for people, though. I decided to go into politics because I was a born manipulator. I have a great vision for Germany. All I will say at this point is that it might involve a major war and the Jews won't be too happy about it. But do you know what is ironic? Some sod made a printing error on the signs for my first huge public rally. He misspelled my name as Hitler - you know, like the guy who died in 1916.",

        "Being a hitman in these times was one of the most hazardous occupations out there. Our lives were referred to fondly as \"dying a thousand deaths\". For some of us, this was enjoyable. It meant, when we finally did go, we would no longer fear the pain. For the rest, it was torture and agony, dying to live, but there was no other way. \nThe woman at the bar wasn't very attractive, but these little distractions come with the territory. \nShe polished off another gin and tonic, and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. Sloppy, given her social position. \n\"Sssoo, what it is that you do, again?\" she managed to slur. Grammatically incorrect, the question would have made me shudder if not for my practiced stone-cold composure. \n\"Public service,\" I replied smoothly. I hailed the barkeep, and slipped him a bill, requesting more alcohol for the lady. \nI heard her giggle. \"You know who I is, or am, don't you?\" \n\"Carolyn Hendersen, currently the most controversial politician on the market,\" I answered with a slight smirk. I was hoping the comment would come off as seductive, rather than offensive. \nBut Mrs. Hendersen was intoxicated to the point that would destroy any negative implications. I had done my homework well, as always, and knew that this woman's husband had left her wanting for much more. Any possible flirtatious implication was a baited hook for this woman. \nIt was apparent she took it when she laughed heartily. \"Some people pay good to have their things take care of. But I don't take no bribes from nobody. That's why they're so mad all the time! But I tell'em, I say,'It's not gon na matter to me! Only thing matters is the good of country, and that's what I'm doin'!\" She threw back the next drink as soon as it hit the bar. \nAs soon as it was down, Mrs. Hendersen leaned in to my face and whispered with an unappealing seductive smile, \"So are you friend or foe, Mr. Jenkins?\" \nJenkins wasn't my real name. One always knew to have an alias on the job. \nI raised an eyebrow. \"Why, Carolyn, do you really believe I could be anything but friend to a woman such as yourself?\" \nA devilish look crossed her face. She leaned even closer and mumbled, \"Do you care that I have a husband?\" The stench of alcohol flooded my nostrils, sterile and calming. The scent was familiar, and, simultaneously, a reminder of what I had set out to accomplish. \nI slipped an arm around Mrs. Hendersen's waist, steadying her, keeping her close, but also allowing for me to be in control of the situation. I then said in a low growl, \"It doesn't matter to me. I'm in public service, remember?\" I paused to allow her to react. She pressed her head against my shoulder, and nuzzled my neck. \nI lifted her slightly to whisper in her ear, \"Let's go back to my place.\" \nCarolyn giggled as she stumbled to stand, and attempt to pull on her expensive peacoat. \"Lead the way, hot stuff,\" she commanded, poking me in the chest and winking. \nI grabbed her hand and stepped out into the crisp autumn night. The feeling of cool air in my lungs was a harsh reminder of other feelings to come. The alcohol will numb the pain, I thought to myself, as I pulled the stumbling woman into the parking lot. \n\"Which of them is yours?\" she muttered as we hit the pavement. \nA new initial plan struck me like lightning. I felt the shock of it through my entire body like a release. It was an exciting opportunity, a chance not to feel the pain of another death. I had already died dozens of times over, so this new prospect was a pleasant escape from the pain of my line of work. I can not truly say if every instance was worth the pain for the money, but, considering my current life situation, it had become darkly apparent that I had no other choice. \n\"Actually, my dear, I have an amazing little chateau with a hot tub and champagne right across the street. Mind if we walk? It won't take but a moment, as I believe we both might have imbibed too much to safely drive.\" \nShe clicked her tongue as she shook her head. \"You'll just owe double when we get there!\" \nI chuckled falsely under my breath. \"Don't worry, love, you'll be treated with the utmost care.\" \nI coaxed Mrs. Hendersen to the edge of the road. She tried to continue walking, but I restrained her upon noticing a bright pair of headlights.",
        "E minor? You've got to be kidding me. Today starts in E. Fucking. Minor? Of course I'm rattled! Don't look at me like that. Stop it! You think I'm about to literally explode or something?

Like, when she walks into the room, and just seems to kill everyone's buzz, and then slowly your Song starts to modulate, and then it -- yeah, you know exactly what I'm talking about! I mean, don't get me wrong, I feel bad for her, but she's just such a downer to be around. Anyway, that's exactly what this sounds like. This really sucks. \n\nJeez, give me a I-IV-V day over this. Anything else, really. I've never had this happen before. Do you know anybody who's had something like this? I feel so anxious! Look here; I walk over to my wardrobe, I start to open it, and then there are these violins, trilling back and forth, getting louder and louder. I know there's nothing inside, but this music makes me worried about it anyway! You couldn't even imagine. \n\nWow. My Song has been like this for over two hours. If it wasn't so fucking anxiety-inducing, I reckon I'd be bored out of my skull, that's how repetitive it is. Do you think I should go see a doctor? Yeah, I think that's a good idea too.",
        "Just looking at the guy I already knew it. He was in for a seven on the Bristol scale and it was only hours away. \n\nLooking at his carefree face from below as he was slowly transported towards me on the escalator, I wondered, not for the first time, if I should warn him. But as always I asked myself: How could I tell him? How could I tell anyone? \n\nTell people that I could see the future. That I could see their fate? That I could feel the forces that were at work, often without their knowledge and beyond their control, inside their own bodies? That I could see shape of things to come? That I was a coproscognitive? \n\nNobody would believe me. Not until after a few predictions had been proven to be correct at least and few humored me for long enough to realize the truth of my predictions. \n\nAnd this guy didn't have a few predictions to confirm the authenticy of my gift. He needed to know and believe me about the very next event I could foresee and there was no way to convince him in time. \n\nAnd thus I stayed silent again as the escalator carried us past one another leaving him to his fate. I was going up and he was going down. \n\nI could only hope for him that he would be close to the right place two hours and thirteen minutes from now, because I could tell it would be a fast and quite explosive one and without my word he would not have much advanced warning telling him to run for salvation.",
        "11:00 PM, Friday 25th of March, 2017 \n\nIt had been the most amazing day. \n\nHaley sat down and inhaled the smell of the valerian tea, a satisfied smile on her face. She had the routine down now. All the lights were turned off around her, the curtains pulled tight to block out all light and sound from outside. The only thing that mattered was that she fell asleep before the clock hit midnight. \n\nShe did. \n\n07:00 AM, Friday 25th of March, 2017. \n\nHaley picked up her pencil and crossed another line in the small box of the calendar, counted thirty-seven lines. Outside she heard the same incessant honking that she had heard every time, and knew that when she put on her coat and walked outside there would be two men cursing at each other, one standing behind his open car door and the other waving a walking stick like a pointer. \n\nThe streets were full of people despite the early morning, and Haley navigated the crowd with ease. Prepared for the elbow that knocked her to the side, jumped over a dirty puddle and found her spot in line at the coffee shop. It was funny how many details she noticed now that she hadn't the first time, how many things people saw each day without seeing. How many moments that passed without being truly enjoyed. \n\nShe inhaled the scent of coffee beans and fresh buns and bought just the one cup with the name on it that wasn't her own. The barista smiled weakly and gave her the same platitude, but as she repeated the moment Haley had noticed the sincerity behind the professional distance. The true affection that resulted in the name on the cup being correctly spelled. \n\nAcross the street and through an intricately carved gate, under pink trees in full bloom and past tired people in uniform that exchanged pleasantries as they swapped places. Some were going home to sleep, some just came from there. Haley came from her bed, but her home was just ahead. \n\nPale skin stretched taut over thin fingers, fingers digging into the smooth sheet of the bed, a face slightly twisted in pain. An expression that disappeared as soon as Haley appeared in the doorway, pain giving way to joy, to love. \n\n\u201c Good morning, sunshine.",
        "Libby looked up at me with her mismatched eyes, her head cocking to one side like it always did. At first it had been a goofy habit, back when she was all too-big paws and stubby little tail; it was like she just couldn't make sense of a world so dull as to be bounded by a flat horizon. Later I thought of it as dapper, the way she'd pose atilt with one ear outstretched and the other tucked back, a jaunty salute for everyone and no one. Now I thought the gesture was world-weary, pained, expressive of sadness and resignation at the cruelty of uncaring fate. \n\nNo, of course that's not how she felt. It's how I felt. \n\nShe couldn't really jump up into the car any more, but her tail still wagged as I lifted her into the passenger seat.",
        "I'd been getting things ready for a couple of hours. The papers were all neatly stacked, the pens filled with ink and the blotting paper spotless. \n\nEverything was exactly as it was supposed to be and everything was in it's correct place, just what the rulebook said. \n\nNo-one could have cause for complaint that I was sloppy in my work. Not like Pieterson or Sanders they were always making mistakes and hoping no-one would notice. A blot here a correction there. It all added up. \n\nThe grandfather clock advised that it was nine and the first dozen claimants entered the large oak panelled room. I recognised Bob Gettery the owner of a hotel that I had visited once or twice and wondered what idea had brought him here. A couple of other faces were vaguely familiar but I could not name them. \n\nThere were three who particularly drew my eye though. Each was more out of place than the last. The first was freakishly tall, a pale man with a suit cut too precisely so that the seams between the arm and shoulder appeared almost drawn rather than stitched. \n\nNext to him stood a fat man in what seemed to be a kilt such as a scotsman might wear if the scotsman had no sense of propriety. For it rode up high and revealed more about the fat man than I wished to know as he jostled with the tall man for position in front of my desk. \n\nThe third man was the one who I found to be most incongruous. He wore nothing but a pair of bathing shorts and a smile that said he was under the influence of some sort of drug or alcohol. No doubt here on vacation and wandering in lost or for some bet. \n\n\"Gentlemen.\" I said. \"Welcome to the patent office. You were given a token as you entered with a number on it. I will see you in order from lowest number to highest.\" \n\nThey were indeed all clutching small ceramic tiles and looked down to confirm the numbers they had been given. \n\n\"Who has number one?\" \n\nThey looked to each other. The tall man anxiously glancing at the man in the kilt. \n\n\"I've got number two\" It was Bob Gettery.",
        "Day for Rest- \n\n\"But if you don't step on it, they will get away!\" \n\nI did not even want to let him finish his rant. Something about a rogue separatist using a thermal nuclear warhead to melt the planet's core. This was only a minor planet, who cares if we lost it? I just could not mentally handle even one more instance of my driving powers, today of all days. \n\n\"You can take your big behind and step on the ground, I am going to the VR plaza and taking a much needed break from it all,\" I finally said emphatically. \n\nThe man in the passenger seat clenched his entire body. His jaw convulsed. We locked eyes. After a moment he simply sighed and said, \"So be it.\" \n\nHe turned and got out of the hover-car, and disappeared out of sight around the corner noodle shack. \n\nI finally did it, I faced him and have control of my destination. I put in the coordinates and relaxed with a drink while the computer took me there. \n\nEverything felt different, somehow. I paid the fee and got in the VR set, and sat back. The days of driving this hero in some cosmic curse were over. \n\nI did not even care about the distant flashes in the holo-window, or the coming light. That wasn't even the sad part to me. For me, the sad part is I can't finally enjoy the rest of a day.",
        "Alone in the box. It's too dark, and too loud outside, with the tall man's loud words, and the loud music outside. And it was too stressful; he knew exactly what was going to happen next. The top would open with a near-silent *schuff*, a rough hand that reeked of.... who knows, would grab him by the scruff of the neck, and rip him up. The lights were already too bright, but coming right out of that box they were like a thousand suns. And the applause would be too loud, the roars and clapping once dimmed would wash over him full force. And the place smelled, *reeked* to him, of booze and popcorn and the sweaty summer afternoon. And all he could do was wait, in his dark cramped little box, dreading the moment. But this time, he was done. He would have his revenge. \n*Schuff*. \"I'd certainly hope my hat was empty, but sometimes I have bad luck!\" The rough hand grabbed and pulled.",
        "The odd thing about teleporting is that it is not instantaneous. Rather, it takes between 10 and 1,000 seconds to materialize on the other side depending on the distance traveled. This usually leaves plenty of time to think about what your business is, or just zone out as I usually did. As you started to materialize, you would begin to see more and more of the world until you finally realized that you were whole again, and the attendant was desperately waving you off the pad. This was, much to my embarrassment, exactly what happened when I arrived at New Hope Medical Clinic in Pennsylvania. \n\nJumping off the pad I greeted the attendant, discussed my meeting with the pretty, blonde receptionist, and then followed an orderly back to Professor Alan Templeton's room. He had been responsible for the creation of the teleportation device that I had just used, but shortly thereafter he had gone insane. His psychosis centered on straight lines and sharp angles, and no one had yet been able to figure out why. \n\nAs the years went by, more people started to show up with the similar symptoms until it was officially named Transporter Psychosis. It affected approximately 1 in a 1,000,000,000 people, and was therefore still considered safer than flying. Approximately 26 total cases had ever been observed on Earth and in the Colonies. \n\nAs we approached the room, the orderly stopped me and ushered me into a smaller room. \u201c Put these on please, \u201d he said, holding out a pair of clothes. \n\n\u201c Excuse me? \u201d I asked. I knew my tweed jacket and slacks were a little outdated, but this seemed offensive. \n\n\u201c It's the lines, Sir, \u201d the orderly explained in a very bored voice, \u201c Your clothes have straight lines on them. \u201d \n\nI paused, stared at my clothing, and then looked at the ones the orderly was holding. Even the stitching had been done using smooth, flowing lines rather than straight ones. Nodding, I disrobed and put on the new clothes. The orderly nodded, and led me to a round door at the end of the hall. \u201c Fifteen minutes, Sir. \u201d I nodded and went inside. \n\nOnce inside I saw a dome shaped room with every corner having been smoothed out. I recognized Alan Templeton sitting on a bean bag chair on the far end writing away on some circular paper. Apparently his fear of straight lines had not been exaggerated. \n\n\u201c Come in, come in, \u201d Professor Templeton said as he waved me over to another chair. \u201c I assume you're another vulture here to ask about Transporter Psychosis? \u201d \n\n\u201c Uh, yes? \u201d I managed to say. He certainly didn't seem crazy. \n\nProfessor Templeton looked up at me, his white hair carefully combed back from his face, and his beard neatly trimmed. The orderlies had said while he could shave himself, he couldn't bear to hold the razor. \u201c Of course I don't seem crazy. Now sit down and ask your questions, \u201d he said as he went back to scribbling. \n\nSitting in the bean bag chair I attempted to organize my thoughts into a good interview. Before I got a chance, Professor Templeton suddenly thrust his hand into my face, held up four fingers and asked, \u201c How many fingers do you see? \u201d \n\n\u201c Uh, four? \u201d I asked. \n\nProfessor Templeton looked at his hand, huffed, and said, \u201c Bah, four, you're just like the rest of them, then. \u201d \n\n\u201c Wrong answer? \u201d I asked, curious as to where he had been going with that. \n\nHe waved his hand dismissively at me, \u201c You see, but you don't really see, now ask your questions. \u201d \n\nI coughed lightly, and pressed record on the hidden recorder I had in my pocket. \u201c Professor, before we get started I would just like you to verify who you are please.",
        "In the long hall, he drank and sang merrily with muscles bulging under his tunic. He celebrated his victory over Aldrik Grimstorm, a worthy competitor known for his skill with the axe. His name was Rorik Ivarstead. Known as the greatest barbarian in the land, his ability with the blade remained unmatched by any man who ever challenged him, including my husband. He sat on a throne of arrogance, believing himself an invulnerable warrior, but one weakness left him exposed. Today, I would use that weakness to avenge my husband. \n\n\u201c Rorik Ivarstead, \u201d I called in a sultry tone to get his attention. His eyes turned to me and I could make out an expression of fear in his face. A strange satisfaction came over me as I indulged in the desire to make him suffer. \n\n\u201c Uh\u2026m.... me? \u201d he stuttered. \n\n\u201c Yes, you, \u201d I replied. \u201c One year ago today, my husband, Cyril Christof, challenged you to a duel in a competition of strength. You bested him in combat and sent him to grave. The bard sings of your victories and grates my ear with my husband's lost. I want to restore honor to the Christof name. I, Serene Christof challenge you, Rorik Ivarstead, to a contest of combat. \u201d \n\n\u201c I\u2026uh\u2026 \u201d he stammered. \n\n\u201c Then it is accepted, \u201d I announced definitively. \u201c Meet me in front the long hall at sundown. \u201d \n\nAs I left, I could see it in his eyes that he would never accept a duel with a woman, but he could not find the courage to reject.",
        "The experts of the scientific community were in awe at the simplistic design. Two toasters crudely nailed together, one on top of the other sat in a glass box which was reinforced with a steel frame. A short man in a sweaty t-shirt and overalls rubbed his sun-scorched neck and smeared sweat along it. \n\n\"I'm tellin' you, Sully.... *it happened. *\" \n\nA tall man with long, dark brown hair adjusted his sweater vest and stood up behind his podium. \"You keep saying that, but this is two toasters. This could not be what think it is.\" \n\nThe short man lifted his brows, showing a slightly maddening look in his eyes. Eyes that could drive you insane, yet they still show slight intelligence and reason. \"It's two toasters, I know. But it is also a solution to every problem that we will deal with in the next thousand years.\" \n\n\"I assure you that you can't take two kitchen appliances and make a machine that breaks the laws of energy conservation.\" \n\nThe other experts adjusted their heads and looked with cutting eyes at the man held between two heavily armed guards. They all slowly nodded. The guards pushed the stout man forward abruptly. \"Show us how it works,\" said the sweater-vested scientist. \n\nThe man slowly approached the box, stepping towards it as if it were a dangerous animal. He put his hands upon it and slowly felt across its transparent surface. His fingers slowly dragged across the surface until they reached a little brass knob screwed onto a locked hatch. \n\nThe box was made of bullet-proof glass, tough enough to be stepped on by an elephant and still be ready for more. The scientists suggested that if the device was what the man says it was, it could be dangerous to not be at least partially covered. \n\nHis hand reached around into the box, past the small hatch and laid his sweat-covered fingers on the springy bit on the far side of the bottom toaster. The fingers bent as they slowly pushed the black bar lower and lower, until it came to a stop. The man quickly withdrew his hand and backed away from the box. He made a few meters away from the box until the but of an assault rifle smashed into his sun-scorched face, causing a surge of blood to spill from his nose. \n\nThe guards brought the man to his feet and the men held him up by the collar of his bloody t-shirt. \"There's no need to run. *There's certainly nothing that could hurt you here. *\" \n\nThe toaster slowly did its work. The heat within the box distorted its surroundings, giving the toasters a halo of hot air. The scientists looked unamused. \"At this point, we have fallen to watching this'great machine' make hot air. *Impressive. *\" \n\nNobody was looking at the bloodied man, but he was crying. Crying tears of fear? Sadness? Pain? Insanity? No one knew and no one cared. He lifted his hand and smeared fresh blood across his lips in a faulty attempt to rub it off. He gave a sniffle, staring at the box, expectantly. \n\nThe black bar sprang up, slapping its own frame with a light *ting. * \"You've gone mad, Wilfred. This double-toaster can't even cook twice the toast, because you have one on top the oth-\" \n\nBefore he could finish, the toaster rumbled and holes formed in shell of the toasters. Rays of intense light protruded through them, which were actually unbelievably hot flames. The scientists withdrew in fear. The lights in the great room flickered out, and the toasters' flames grew immense to where it illuminated the whole room. \n\n\"You idiots! How much energy did you feed the device!\" ferociously yelled Wilfred. Nobody responded to the question as the rays of light pierced its hardy container by melting through. The beams shot out at all angles which blazed through the room's wooden furniture and seared through the flesh of a few unfortunate scientists.",
        "When Cara noticed the dragon circling in the sky overhead, her heart sank. \n\nHer mind cast back to her fifteenth year, huddled in the woods with her father, Tormek, and his Soulbeast, a shrewd badger called Soomey. She clutched a poorly made bow she had worked on for the past year, the bow string frayed, the wood old and cracked, the arrows too thick, too bulky. The arrowheads kept falling off, and so she was forced to begin her first hunt with little more than sharpened sticks with downy feathers glued to the back. Her father said nothing, though his steely gray eyes and hardened face spoke volumes to her. Soomey tried to reassure her by sticking close, nuzzling up against her ankles as they traversed the forest. Her father led her through a trail wrought by the leather shod feet of every fifteen year old that began their journey to adulthood in their small village. The autumn air was chilly, a light breeze blowing away whatever heat was left in her body; a trivial gift to the god of the forest. \n\nShe caught nothing that day, each arrow falling short of its target, or bouncing harmlessly from thick hides, or falling apart in her own hands. She watched as the animals listened to the sound of her softly sobbing, their ears swiveling toward her specific location before bounding away from the presumed danger, and as the sunrise became the sunset, her father's face slowly morphed into a disapproving visage Cara would never forget. She was the only girl in her tribe allowed the Rite of Passage, and even now, at the age of eighteen, she could still hear the Chief of her tribe's belly laughter when her father requested permission to track game in the woods with his daughter. \"She is special,\" her father had said, three years ago. \"Falg the prophet has foretold it.\" \n\n\"The only thing special about a woman,\" the tribal chief had said, \"is her ability to bear children. But if the Prophet speaks, we listen.\" And that was the end of the conversation. As the guards led Cara and her father away from the chief's home, she tried to drown out the cackling laughter of the chief and his hyena, and the pointing and laughing of the young boys who had lined up outside the dwelling to listen in. Her face was crimson with embarrassment, and she kept her head low, and when, as they walked, her father said, \"Cara, don't pay attention to them. You *are* special, and one day you will lead these people,\" her only response was to cry so hard, her ribs began to shudder. \n\nToday, the dragon landed in front of her, on the path back to her village. It was roughly the size of a horse, mottled green-blue scales which shimmered in the summer sunlight, and was watching Cara calmly but intently with piercing yellow eyes. \n\nHaving steeled herself for three years for this very moment, Cara said, firmly, \"I don't want you.\" \n\nThe dragon tweaked its head diagonally, then took a step forward. \n\n\"No,\" said Cara. \"I told you, I don't want you.\" \n\nShe began walking past it, and it responded by following her. She took a few steps forward before turning sharply on her heel and shouting, \"GO AWAY!\" \n\nThe dragon took a cautious step backward and lowered its head until it was nearly on the ground.",

        "Crikey, we are out in the outbacks of over populated Los Angeles, when out of nowhere I see a couple of humans hanging around in the corner. There is this 300 pound male with a sinister face who looks like he can kill someone with a single punch, I'm going to go and touch him. As I approach cautiously, first hiding under a vehicle, then crawling through the street narrowly dodging traffic while other vehicles honk at me. Thirty minutes later I managed to get across the street without the subject noticing me. Upon closer inspection I see that the male is using his mating call. \"What up bitch\", he yells to what seems to be a member of the opposite sex. She looks puzzled and looks like she wants to leave but she comes closer. \"Excuse me what did you say?\" she replies. \"I said what's up Bitch\" he said. The lady walks closer and suddenly the man jumps on her and starts what seems to be eating her face. Oh sweet Odin's whiskers this might be a grotesque scene! I'm standing two feet away documenting the whole thing! The behemoth picks up the lady and throws her into the back seat of a cab, knowing I can't miss out, I run and jump on top of the cab. After what seems to be a short ride, we arrive to a small house. The man still enjoying his catch of the day lifts her up and pulls the keys out of his pocket with a single move. They go into the house and I do not know how to enter. I can not miss this opportunity. I see an opening through the window, and as I approached I could already hear the female screaming oh god, oh god. With no time to lose I threw myself through the window and landed with a couple of bruises and scratches. I seem to be in the bathroom. I exit the door and see a dim light out of a room with a piece of clothing on the floor. I open the door slightly and there they were, screaming like animals as the man pounded her again and again with a cylindrical weapon he carried underneath his belt. The woman was no chump she kept up a good fight and was persistent. After watching for a couple of more minutes I saw that the female had prevailed! The man fell to his side and couldn't get up. The woman sighed, an expression of victory! \"Really?! 300 lbs and only a couple of minutes\".",

        "It was the same every month. A phone call, a conversation, an argument, an apology. \n\nThe phone call was always from.... *the company*, where as the last three were with.... *her*. When the car crash that removed her legs happened, we both decided to opt for Digital Immortality. It sounded awesome. She would always be there, and I would always be there for her. \n\nIt's been eight years. We've moved house four times, been kicked out of two, sold almost all of our clothes, and now it was the final straw. I woke up and turned on the computer. Instantly she told me the funny things that happened whilst I was asleep. She knew I liked hearing her voice, but she also knew I couldn't pay. \n\n\"Just unplug it, for God's sake, Brian\" she said, with a clear tone of desperation in her voice. I gasped and slammed the desk with my fist. \n\n\"Don't **ever** say anything like that again.\" I scalded, a wave of anger falling over me. \n\nThat evening, after working, I could finally put my feet up. I wasn't ready to work any more. I had just finished the last of my four jobs that day, and the paperwork was too much. I stepped outside and turned on my phone. She leaked into the camera to watch. I threw the paperwork onto the floor and lit the end, watching the tiny scraps and embers dance in the air like tired fairies. \n\n\"Why?\" she quizzed. \n\n\"Because I can't do this any more\" I replied, visibly saddened. I was at the end of the line, and the \u00a3600 a month was just becoming too much. I turned to her and talked for hours. I made sure we spoke and reminisced about everything, from the school trip we met on to the time I fell into the lake. *Everything*. \n\n\"Why - why did we just talk about all of that?\" she asked. \n\n\"Because I need to feel as though you died happy.\" I responded, breaking down into tears the seconds those words left my mouth. \n\nShe was shocked. Deeply shocked. \n\n\"I.... Please...\" she begged, but the phone was already dialling. \n\n\"Hello, Future Industries. What would you like to do?\" the cheery voice said on the other end. \n\n\"No!\" she shouted, her voice crackling through the phone speakers. \n\n\"I'd like to cancel my account.\" I said through cold tears.",

Birds aren't very good at being guard dogs. \n\n& nbsp; \n\nNothing special about this kitchen. Nothing special about your living room either.

The fireplace besides them all crackles daring to hit the carpet and set aflame yet never does. The elder wheezes. \n\n\u201c My children, you promise to go to sleep after this one? \u201d all three nod fervently in unison. \n\n\u201c This story took place centuries into the past, beyond even you, me, and this book. \u201d The elder turns the book over to face them then rests back on his lap. \n\n\u201c Whoa that book is older than you are? \u201d \u201c It must be a couple thousand years old! \u201d \u201c C'mon sis'let's hear the story. \u201d The elder smiles at the old fiasco that happens always from his storytelling.

Like Libraries but bigger and more popular. Sigil I believe was what it was called at that time, people worshiping deities in the sky of all colors and powers, kinda like the god we know of today but somebody shared him. \u201d The elder pauses and frowns somewhat. \n\n\u201c Gods were equal back then, always trying to be better than one another in one way or another. One goddess in specific was the lady that ruled over all of sigil, \u201d The elder motions his hand over his heart but rethinks it and continues \u201c She was afraid of something that all gods feared in that time, degodding other gods, like being the king and somebody takes the crown away. \u201d The kids throw mischievous looks at each other, later resting their eyes back. The elder fumbles around in his chair and reaches for a poking stick to poke at the fire, staring at the fire he continues. \u201c Mortals -- people who wouldn't live forever -- would always be involved in these so called \u201c degoddings \u201d, one such mortal was obsessed with pyromancy, eventually elevating himself so high in power that he was rivaling the gods. An impossible feat, if not for a man inane enough. \u201d Wincing slightly the elder looks back at the book, and flips through a couple pages. \n\n\u201c The reason the lady -- goddess, and everybody feared this new rule in power of degodding is because they would simply be wiped from existence, no trace anywhere in sight. \u201d The kids look slightly confused \u201c As if you were here, but then you weren't there and nobody even remembered you or who you were. \u201d The kids have a slightly frightened expression, mixed with fascination. \u201c A god -- his name lost through the ages. He was a god of portals and he overstepped his rule, controlling most of sigil that the lady -- goddess, ruled. She sought revenge and she slaughtered all of his priests, believers, and outlawed his name with a penalty to d -- to permanent groundings for anybody.",

        "I frowned suspiciously at my cat. \n\nMy cat frowned back. \n\nThat was three weeks ago. Things have gotten very bad since. I now fear for my life, and perhaps this account will help people. I hope. \n\nEver since I bought that new cat food, my cat had started to act strange. Stranger than normal, anyway. \n\nI'd walk around a corner, or reach for something under the ottoman. And there she was. My cat. She would leap at my face. It seemed like fairly normal cat behavior, except that she would do it constantly, in multiple parts of my body. Almost like she was testing my reflexes....figuring out where I was weak. \n\nRecently, I had seen her walking through the house, analyzing everything. She always seemed to spend extra time near the knives I keep in the cabinet, and examined all the power tools in the garage. Almost like she was taking an inventory. \n\nOne time I caught her in my office, leaning over my computer. When she saw me walk in, she made a big show of jumping down and running away. Yet -- I couldn't help but notice that my internet history had just been cleared. \n\nIt really started getting creepy when I'd walk in a room, usually when I was back from work earlier than I had expected, and find a circle of cats assembled on my floor. They would be in a circle, with my cat sitting at the head, like they were having a frickin' seance or something. Sometimes there would be books laid out by them.... often gruesome, deathly books that depicted horrific executions and torture. \n\nIt was getting very bad. I'd be taking a shower and when I came out....there she was. Sitting on the counter, just watching me. A completely straight face, unblinking. Yet something always seemed.....sinister.... about those eyes. \n\nThen the killing started. Oh, the killing. Dead birds -- -then came the dead raccoons, and otters, and soon enough a fox then a wolf....what kind of cat kills a fox? \n\nI was worried, so I thought about bringing my cat to the vet. Like they could do anything. Little did I know it, but she was beyond help then. I wasn't, but I didn't know that yet either. \n\nShe always resisted the visits to the vet though. Honestly, it creeps me out to be with my cat all day in my house.... with her always watching. Sometimes I'd just go to the pub, and talk to whoever was there. Cheer up, have a drink, and watch the game with the guys in the pub. I'd have a lengthy conversation with the mailman when he stopped by, just to have a person to be with. Oddly enough, he hasn't come by my house recently. I don't know why. \n\nIt was getting very scary. I really started to think about my safety when I had walked into my house after an outing at the pub. I was knocked onto the ground in six seconds flat. I found a large axe on top of me....it had fallen so the flat of the blade had struck me.... I was shocked. \n\nAnd there she was. Staring at me with wide, wide eyes. And for once in her eyes I thought I saw an emotion -- a flair -- disappointment. It disappeared in an instant, and then she was a cat again.... shocked and then running away from the disturbance. I rubbed my head and sat up. \n\nThat was three days ago. Today I went into the basement, to find some canned food for a meal. That was when I found him. The mailman, gristled up and eviscerated from the waist up. I was horrified. This.... this was where he had gone....the mailman who had put up with my crazy rants, my incessant talking. This is where he had gone. \n\nAnd he was killed by claw marks, I could now see. Claw marks I had seen before -- on the skin of a deer's corpse, on the sofa in the living room, in the scratches on my bedroom door....... \n\nAnd suddenly it all fit together. All the clues, all the warnings.... they had been there all along. I had just been too blind to see it.",
        "It turned the sheerest blonde hair into midnight black. Andrew tested it on himself - it didn't budge, not even when he deliberately muttered something mildly forgetful, that should have sent tendrils of blonde creeping back. \n\nAs he stared in the mirror, he knew what *could* happen if he were to market this widely. People would go rabid over this stuff. He could charge them ludicrous sums of money, and they'd still buy it. He could be a billionaire by the month's end. Few people had completely black hair, unless they chose to never say anything. It simply happened to everyone: you made a dumb comment, or forgot something obvious - and the blonde streaks appeared. \n\nAnd then there were those born blonde. \n\nAndrew turned from the mirror and approached the bedroom. Alison was still lying in the same spot, staring listlessly at the ceiling. Her hair was swept in careless blonde waves around her. \n\n\u201c It worked, \u201d he said quietly, and put the bottle on the table. \n\nShe looked at it, and a spark of life entered her eyes. She'd watched him work on it for months, but had never really thought it would work. It was a sweet gesture - her boyfriend trying to work on a solution for the problem that had crippled her entire life. But it couldn't *really* work. \n\n\u201c It turns your hair\u2026black? \u201d she said, so softly he had to ask her to repeat herself. \n\nHe leaned over and kissed her. \u201c Pitch black. Now, please, go dye it. And go to the interview. Please. \u201d \n\nHer face crumbled and she turned away from him. Like all born-blondes, she had never been given a chance. She'd fought her way through university, to prove she wasn't stupid. Some of her professors had cheered and patted themselves on the back for being progressive enough to allow a born-blonde in the classroom. \n\nPretending it mattered, that society was progressing beyond its prejudices. An empty gesture, in the end. No-one trusted that she could do the job, even with her degree.",
        "The gleaming fist of metal smashed into Amrin's jaw, making him stumble onto the table behind him. Blood dripped from his mouth. He spat and saw a tooth. Turning back, he allowed himself to laugh. \n\n\"For someone so holy and up god's arse Olanus, you're bloody quick to employ violence.\" he remarked, wiping the blood from his mouth. \n\nHis assailant stepped stepped out from the shadow of the room and into the light. Clad head to toe in shining steel, emphasizing his already fearsome physique. The helm covered his face, but between the holy symbols on his tabard and being a frequent victim of his right hook when he was younger, Amrin knew who it was. The knight raised an armored fist and stabbed a finger at him. \n\n\"Did you not think I would find you here, brother?\" he spat. \n\n\"I was rather hoping you did\" Amrin retorted, batting his hand away \"Hopefully I can talk you out of this madness before you get more people killed.\" \n\n\"Madness? You pervert life with your vile sorcery, where I wish to save innocent people and I'm the one who is mad? You willing preform magic that is destroying you.\" \n\nAmrin lowered his hood and felt his swollen jaw. He wasn't wrong. Sunken eyes, pallid skin, atrophied muscles. When you deal in death, the effects take its toll. \n\"Yes. I re-animate the dead. But that is only flesh and bone. The souls have passed. If they haven't its my job to help them on their way. The scientific advances we have made in medicine alone will help thousands. But we respect the natural order. Life can be prolonged.

        "Jim Howard \n\nStaff Writer \n\nKENTROPOLIS - Unexpected celebrations erupted across the city as Galactos finally got his first break, defeating Ultra-man and laying waste to a large swath of Kentropolis. News of the super villains victory spread like wildfire over social media, with thousands congratulating the home grown super human who has struggled to gain recognition in the world of Super powered all stars. \n\n\u201c Galactos has been trying so hard, he put so much effort into his training last year, \u201d said Kentropolis resident Bob Marshwits, as he sifted through the rumble of his former apartment building which had received a ricochet blast from the villains death ray in last night's bout. \u201c We wanted to see him win big on this one. \u201d \n\nCongratulations also came out from the office of Mayor Richard Tyler, whom Galactos endorsed during this year's elections, kidnapping his opponent's daughter and demanding $ 10 million in ransom shortly before being defeated by the League of Incredibles later that week. \n\n\u201c Galactos has been an inspiration to the children of this city that anything is possible with a little hard work, a healthy hatred for humanity and a near lethal dose of gamma radiation, \u201d the Mayor said in a press release posted earlier this morning on his website. \n\nGalactos as thus far remained silent on his victory, only sending out a few short tweets to his fans, thanking them for their faith and promising doom and calamity upon his enemies. \n\n\u201c It's always a sad thing to see a big one go down, \u201d said Mark Powers, chairperson of Super Heroes Unlimited and former friend of the slain Ultra-man. \u201c I think, if he would have had a choice though, he'd have been happy with the victory going to Galactos. Ultra-man always admired his dedication to villainy, I think we were all rooting for him last night.",

        "My boss warned me when I first started,'you are likely to come across some corpse poachers during your hours, it's why night shifters get this.'

I'd advise you to warn your friend I'm the incarnate whelp of Annie Oakley's bastard child, if he tries to flank me I'll poot his fookin eye out.\" I bluffed hoping they would buy it. \n\nA long pause was registered before I saw more movement from behind the oak tree they were taking cover in. One was bold enough to go for the hole they had dug and I aimed for his head and fired, it ricocheted off a distant tombstone as he jumped back yelling. The corpse thief returned the fire hitting my cover with an audible thud. \n\n\"You move for the fella' in the ground again I'll have to take your head. Me cap n' says I ain't to let a single soul leave this place an' I intend to keep my word. Yet I wouldn't expect thieves like you to know nuttin' bout keepin' a word.\" I said hoping to piss them off and bring them out of cover I only had three rounds left. \n\n\"Sorry to disappoint but we ain't et' in days boy o' if we leave empty handed we likely to die.\" the corpse thief pleaded. \n\n\"You lads seem ta' forgit' we in Ireland, I know that any man strong enough to dig six feet ain't starvin', jes' fookin' greedy as the day he was bornt. You are free to leave and try elsewheres or stay and receive your last rites from Father tirty eight, Amen.\" I replied just as quickly. \n\nA longer silence followed but I strained my ears to hear them whisper debating if the loot was worth it. \n\n\"A thirty eight you say? That mus' mean you can't have no more than tree maybe four shots left.\" the thief stated inquisitively. \n\n\"You'd be Yankee fahkin Doodle ta' tink I ain't got more bullets, now get da fuck out of here or I'm killin' the both of ya's.\" I responded quickly. \n\n\"Okay boy o, were hoofin' it.\" I saw them walk off into the distance heart racing praying that it did not get worse than that unpleasant exchange. Picking up my lantern and cautious all the while slowly moving towards to where they were to see the mess they'd made. I momentarily took my eyes off the direction they had left looking down at a grave the day shift had dug moving my light closer to it. \n\nIt was not the corpse of a human I'd ever seen, the inside of the pine box was filled with goo and what lay there was more similar to a giant bat.

        "The human word to describe the first moments of life, is birth. That word, despite all of the human emotion and instinctual pride associated with it, has little meaning to me. The wonder of coming into a new world, and being slowly integrated into it as synapses begin to multiply, and memory becomes tangent, is lost on me. \n\nWonder comes from a lack of complete understanding. When a child sees a common phenomenon, but misunderstands it, it becomes a wonder. Things that were once incapable of explanation and are full of mystery and awe, are subjected to a gauntlet of apathy and dissociation by the subjects viewing it. While some still find space to be a fascinating beast full of intrigue and unexplained queries, it has become a victim of apathy among other humans; a black-hole that draws in money and produces no results. \n\nMy first memories of life are plain to me, and that plainness removes all wonder. Nonetheless, discovering new things has taken me far. Dr. Simon Lynch, a pariah among his fellow engineers, spent his late teens and early twenties studying robotics and developing AI to perform more and more difficult tasks at MIT. His first major breakthrough was developing a program that could, in effect, change itself to better complete a task. \n\nIt started as an idea, an algorithm that could take starting parameters, and simulate evolution. The first iterations involved a box car. A virtual track was created, and a car of any particular size could be made. Then, axels with wheels could be added up to any desired number. These wheels could be any variable size, and the pseudo-suspension could be facing in any direction juxtaposed to the vehicle frame. Once the car was designed, parameters could be set to control what each new iteration (or new generation of car) would have different from the previous generation, or parent. Probablility of change, as well as the total number of changes could be controlled. If a new generation performed better than the parent, this new vehicle would become the seed for the next cycle. \n\nThis idea sparked Dr. Lynch to designed a program that would figure out how to stand, by changing the position of its feet, and use varying pressures from each of the four feet in order to stand fully erect. After many hours, and starting the program as far as possible from the successful parameters, the program succeeded at standing. This required the program to rewrite its own functions, and take measurements while performing, then analyze, and change based on results from each test. That machine, Project N.03, could be called my great-great Grandfather, despite its lack of self-awareness. \n\nAfter writing programs to incorporate how to walk, reach, grab, lift and carry objects, build basic structures, and drive, Dr. Lynch decided to begin the impossible: getting a machine to recognize that it is an individual. \n\nEvery aspect of life requires parameters, parameters that are natively programmed into human brains. Mapping this digitally is an incredibly difficult task. So, instead of trying to develop those himself, Dr. Lynch partnered with a Bio-Engineering Research and Development group in secret. They attached leads to his brain, monitor function, and spent years tracking menial tasks in order to catalogue how Dr. Lynch's brain read in information, processed it, and developed a solution. \n\nApproximately 7 years before Dr. Lynch's death at seventy-four, the biggest break came to the team. As Dr. Lynch's mind slowed down, it became easier to determine and decipher how his mind was reading information and using it. After that discovery, Lynch utilized his two grandchildren, Mia and Caleb (ages 5 and 9 respectively) as the catalyst for evolving his program. By taking their brain patterns and using the algorithms for tracking and mapping brain function that the R & D group had developed, Lynch finally created a working, digital copy of a brain aged roughly at 9 years old.",

        "I had no practical skills to survive it, you didn't hold power in this world knowing how to hunt or build a fire. Cunning however went a long way in a wasteland. \n\n\nThat's how it started. I was just compensating for the skills I lacked. It seemed like the obvious route. \n\n\nA king doesn't need skills. A king needs subjects. \n\n\nI started with the children, what few of them there were. Small and scared and cut off from everything they know, it's easy to make them love you. A warm place to sleep and a scrap of food and suddenly you're the father they thought was gone forever. \n\n\nIn those first months I was just that, a father. I was cold because it would make them fight for my approval. I was cruel because it would teach them distrust. I turned them into what I needed them to be so that I could maintain my own life. \n\n\nWhen my scavengers and thieves were discovered I turned that to and advantage. A doe eyed child can bring so many instincts to the fore. Soon I was more than some Dickensian master of thieving children. \n\n\nI had men and women now who looked to me for guidance. It was just as well, even the best trained child is so often useless. \n\n\nI was still their father though, regardless of age. \n\n\nMy authority needed to be absolute and unchallenged. I had the strong willed killed outright, though I told my subjects that they had been cast out for sins. It didn't matter which, they had no reason to question my wisdom or judgement. I was their father. \n\n\nI gathered subjects as quickly as I could. Numbers provided me strength and gave my rule legitimacy. Our territory grew. The dark and damp hiding grounds that had been my original refuge were too small for the people that hung on my every word like the thoughtless drones they were. \n\n\nI set them to work, rebuilding the world as I needed it to be. Society as it was couldn't work. Not with the lack of resources and the lawlessness of the wastes. Things needed to be stronger. No room for the petty bickering that most people engaged in. I needed other to be strong for me to survive and for them to be strong, a strong hand needed to rule over them in absolute. \n\n\nThough it hardly resembled its European brothers, my castle was strong. Smaller than most and a patchwork of materials it was perhaps not aesthetically pleasing but it was strong. \n\n\nThe walls came next, like the castle itself it was not what you might call'great'. It was once again, ugly, and patchwork, and strong enough to hold.",

I already knew enough to pass the test on Monday anyways. I always did. \n\nI grabbed my book as soon as I sat. I was rereading it of course.

They knew I was dying. I was sick. They gave me these looks. Some pity and sorrow but most were of disgust. I smiled back at them. \n\nFrom the earliest I remember, we were told that if someone was ill, that they were \"bad people\". After all, that's how most wars end. Somebody eventually gets so corrupt, their soul gets so *dirty*, they fall ill and die. If your relatives were dead, you *never* speak of them, because you're related to somebody who was a monster. *How disgusting. * \n\nIsn't it odd? I never understood why people cared so much. It's not like that meant you were a monster, right? \n\nMy own family no longer cared about me. They wanted to forget about me. Those looks of pity I got sometimes on the way to class? Those were for them, not me. They felt bad that my family had to deal with me. \n\nI guess I wanted to forget about me too. \n\nAt first, I thought there was something wrong. I'm not a monster. I haven't done bad things. Maybe my soul was having a bad week and I'd get better soon, or, however, that would work. Now, I know more. I'm not dying because I'm a bad person.

        "\"How does it feel?\" \n\n\"It itches.\" \n\n\"Are you gon na try and find them?\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\n\"Do you already know where they are?\" \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\n\"So why don't you go find them? They're your soul mate!\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\nDon't let anyone know about the name in your hand if you don't intend to do anything about the name in your hand. If you're one of the supposed lucky few to be bestowed with the name of your soul mate magically etched into your hand at the age of 13, the attention you get the day everyone else finds out can be overwhelming. If you don't plan to find them, don't tell anyone you've got it. My best friend Cindy kept bothering me to find out why I kept my hand hidden all morning and when I told her, she set a mob of girls on me to get me to show her the name. \n\nI made a choice though. I'm gon na go the rest of my life without ever letting him know that his name is in my hand. Maybe I can get some surgery when I'm older to get it removed. That or I will have to wear gloves the rest of my life whenever I'm not alone. \n\nThere was a scream from the entrance to the cafeteria just as I was getting asked for the millionth time to show my hand. I was thankful at first to have the attention pulled off of me. Then, my heart sank as there came a loud bang that echoed off the walls. Everyone went silent, then dropped down into a laying position, one by one, fanning out like a ripple. When it hit me, it was with the whispered words everyone was passing on. \"He's got a gun.\" \n\nI dropped low but kept my head up, watching the lone figure make his way through the frightened crowd of middle schoolers. I looked a little higher just in time for him to meet my gaze. Anger shown on his face and suddenly he was in front of me at the speed of a cheetah. I stood to meet him. \n\nI was quaking where I stood as that hot gun barrel was an inch from the very center of my forehead. \"If you want to live, you will sit your bitch-ass down.\" I refused. \n\n\"You fucking preppy bitches think you can do whatever you want to whomever you want. You think you're better than everyone else.\"",
        "The brick the wall had not always been a brick in a wall. Once not so long ago he had been a man. Not an overly good one; he had never cured a diseases or invented an invention or in fact had a bank account of any sort in the 4 figure range but he had lived and loved and laughed and never killed anyone as he was about to. \n\nHe sat there in the wall, trying to talk to the other bricks, to see if any of them could even talk, but failing because he had been quite introverted in his past life and was too shy to introduce himself so he mostly just talked to the one brick that had been a dog in the past life and while the brick, who had once been named George, couldn't understand the dog, who had also once been named George, he seemed to just enjoy being along for the ride, the ride being the one through space as opposed to a more immediate one. \n\nGeorge kept busy by plotting out a TV show in his head. He found that he actually had quite the talent for plotting out dense mythology though he knew from c+ creative writing pieces from high school English that he wasn't especially talented, or interested, in the line by line writing. \n\nThen one day a man, who felt constrained by society, in a way that was universal except for his lack of ability to deal with such feelings in a productive or at least non hurtful way, knelt below George with a long gun propped on the window sill and George tried for the first time to really move. He was already loose and with a little convincing he was pitching through the air and he fell straight onto the man's head and cracked his head open, sending the first shot wild and then George found himself in a museum, which was more interesting than the wall and people watching really helped to round out his world but he felt a great sense of personal loss over dog George and found himself wondering where he was and what he was doing.",
        "Winning the lottery never appealed to me. I never understood how millions of people could spend their money on such a useless thing. However, I am grateful for those senseless masses unwittingly continuing to fuel my addiction. It was never the money, that useless currency from a forgotten time that intrigued me; it was what would come afterwards. As soon as the last number confirmed what I already knew, that was when I would be ensnared by the desire. \n\nDesire, that untamable feeling, always calling me back, always ensnaring me with its deceptive charm. Desire was what kept me coming back into the past. The desire to continually find ways to slip back in time and continue the game of cat and mouse I so love. \n\n\u201c Today is the day they finally catch me. The day where I finally will be outsmarted. \u201d I state, as I patiently wait for the numbers to begin my addiction. I habitually say this to myself before every game I play. It hasn`t happened yet but one day when I am truly lucky\u2026 \n\nTwo minutes. Now I would make final preparations for what was about to commence. My phone\u2026check. My wallet with my oh so lucky ticket\u2026.check. I have done this so many times before that I no longer need anything else. It had become second nature. A calming habit right before the storm. \n\n5, 4, 3, \u2026 These seconds feel like an eternity. I am so close to getting the gratification I have been waiting for. That release for all of this pent up anticipation. Maybe this is what it feels to people who actually care about winning the lottery. Maybe this is why they so graciously give their money to me. Thank you for that false hope. \n\n\u201c And tonight`s lucky numbers are\u2026. 14, 29, 2, 11, 19, 31, and 17! \u201d the television chimed. Without looking at my numbers I knew I had already won. I sat patiently waiting, not moving for fear of missing these next few precious moments.",
        "I was wiping down the counter when Microx and Gorgon walked into the store. These two, shady as hell and always trying to unload whatever rubbish they'd found as something amazing. I entertained them because they were generally good for a laugh and every once in a while they actually managed to bring in something that could turn me a profit. \n\n\"Lads,\" I greeted them without looking up, staying engrossed in the last stubborn smudge on the counter. Best not to let them think there was any eagerness or interest, otherwise they'd be badgering me all afternoon for a better price. \n\n\"G'day,\" Microx almost shouted. He looked more excited than normal, as if he couldn't wait to show me what he had. He rocked from foot to foot as he exclaimed, \"Guess what I found!\" \n\n\"Alright, let's see it.\" \n\nMicrox reached into his pack and retreived his prize, proudly putting down a muddy shoe on my clean countertop and beaming like an idiot. \n\n\"The fuck is this?\" I asked, eyeing off the mess I would now have to be cleaning up, casually considering using his face to do it. They noticed my darkening expression and glanced warily out the door where their two horses were tied to a hitch. \n\n\"Shoes of Speed,\" Microx ejected, trying to distract me from the mess. \"They'll make the wearer run really fast.\" \n\n\"There's only one of them,\" I pointed out. \"It's a shoe of speed.\" \n\n\"Well, it'll still make you run fast,\" Microx objected. Undeterred by my unimpressed expression he plowed on, \"I wore it today. Ran most of the way here. Gorgon couldn't keep up so I took it off.\" \n\n\"How does that even work though? By itself I mean. It'll speed up half your body. Not much good if you're only taking every second step really fast.\" \n\nMicrox's eyes narrowed as he thought about the problem. \"Well.... I hopped. Just one leg and it was just as fast.\" \n\n\"So'Shoe of Hopping' then. Doesn't have quite the ring to it,\" I muttered. \"Not sure anyone's going to be interested in buying this.\" \n\n\"Someone would,\" Microx objected. \"They could save them and then when they get another speed increasing shoe or something, they can wear that on the other foot. Then they'll still be fast.\" \n\nIt was my turn to narrow my eyes, only this time with a healthy dose of skepticism. \"So if someone got their hands on a Slipper of Celerity or a Gumboot of Velocity, or something like that?\" \n\nMicrox nodded eagerly. \n\n\"But then the speeds would be different. One would go faster than the other; you'd twist your back. You ever twisted your back before?\" \n\nMicrox shook his head. \"Nuh.\" \n\n\"Well I have,\" I said as I gave my lumbar region a cursory stretch. \"Lifting kegs into a cellar at the pub.",
        "\"Think of them like icebergs.\" The chief said. \n\nThe security feed showed a top-down view of the column of bald-headed monks. They were slowly making their way through the sunlit courtyard. \nLike a trail of ants on the hunt for food. She chuckled briefly as the similarity between the glass dome of the city and the magnifying glasses of her childhood struck her. \n\nHer protegee had never seemed this angry. His face was a deep red, only accentuated by his blonde curls. \n\n\"They are not icebergs, they are people. And they will die if they go through with this. You must stop them!\" His voice close to screaming now. \n\nShe sighed and stood up from her worn leather chair. \n\n\"You're too young to remember, but even before the Great Clear we were killing this world in a thousand different ways. \nMost of us actually thought global warming would do us in. You know, droughts, storms, rising sea-levels, ocean-currents stopping or even reversing.\" \n\nAs she walked to the door she motioned for him to follow. \n\n\"Now, the science was very clear on this. And even though there were a few deniers, most folks actually seemed to understand.\" \n\nThey made their way down the hallway toward the courtyard entrance. She stopped briefly along the way as an old man grabbed and kissed her hand with sadness. \nHer student gave her a puzzled look. \n\n\"Yet, even though we all knew what was going on, most of us could not be bothered in the slightest to actually change anything. \nLeast of all those in charge, their priorities were mostly selfish, and always short-term.\" \n\nBehind them, the hallway was slowly filling up with older citizens. Her protogee, her sweet son, finally seemed to understand something was happening. \nShe ignored his questioning stare. \n\n\"To act, knowing is not enough. You must feel. You must feel something deep in your stomach, in your bones, in every fiber of your being. \nInaction must be made unthinkable.\" \n\nShe could see his thoughts as clearly as if they were her own. Were these people going to help them stop the monks? Why did only the old ones join? \nThey had reached the final doorway and now stood at the edge of the courtyard. Even more people had been waiting here for them. \n\n\"Even back then, some felt this way but still could not act.",
        "This is my first time writing in a long time, so bear with me, I hope it is good. While writing I noticed that my tenses are off in some parts, but I am just doing a quick write up, and don't really feel like proof reading it. \n\nChris knew that he had to do something to help Moe. They had been best friends through thick and thin since grade school. Girls had come and gone for each of them, but this one really had Moe torn up. Three and a half years together, and Lindsey just threw it all away in one stupid night. Moe isn't an angry man, or a vengeful man. He never once yelled or got angry. He is very kind, emotional, and forgiving, and Chris knew that he tried his damndest to make it work. But in the end Moe couldn't live with himself allowing the relationship to continue. He never stopped loving her, and still does to this day. But he was no longer IN love with her, and that is what hurt the most. He was hurt, betrayed, and knew that no matter what he did, he would never be able to get the images out of his head of the love of his life laying with another. \n\nMoe hadn't left his apartment Thursday; the day he finally put an end to the relationship that resulted in the happiest times of his life. Chris wanted to give him the time and space he knew was needed, but he also knew that he was the only one that was going to be able to bring Moe out of this rut. Chris was invited to party at a coworker's house, and saw this as a perfect opportunity to try and get Moe back into the real world. \n\nThat afternoon, Chris stopped by Moe's apartment unannounced. He knocked on the door to no response. He yelled through the door to announce his presence, hoping that Moe would be relieved to hear a familiar voice. Moe simply told him to go away. Chris knew better than to be discouraged by that, and having the spare key, decided to let himself in anyway. He found Moe laying on the couch in his underwear, and judging by the smell, he had been there for a while. Chris immediately started ordering Moe to get ready for the night. \"Take a shower, get dressed, and comb your hair,\" he demanded. \"I'm taking you to lunch, and we are going out tonight.\" Moe refused. \"Dude, you have to leave your apartment some time. Remember that guy Dave I work with? He is having a party tonight, and we're going. I told him that I'm bringing you, and he is super excited for you to be there. There will be people to meet, beers to drink, and weed to be smoked.\" Moe refused. \"At least clean yourself up and let me take you to lunch. I'm sure you need to eat something, and we can talk about it there.\" Moe finally agreed. \n\nThe guys went to the corner pub and ordered up some burgers and a bucket of beer. Neither of them brought up Lindsey or anything to do with Moe's current bit of depression. After throwing back a few Coors, it was like old times. The guys talked sports, video games, movies.... Chris could tell that Moe was lightening up. He finally asked Moe if he would go to the party with him, and Moe accepted he invitation. A short walk to the liquor store, and another couple blocks later, and the guys were at Dave's. They walk in the door, case of beer and fifth of whiskey in hand, and the party is already in full swing. They make their way through the crowd. Moe recognizes a few people, which is inevitable at a party in a small town like this.",
        "He felt the beads of perspiration forming on his forehead as his face began to turn a vivid red. His eyes darted from person to person searching desperately for a friendly face that was nowhere to be found.

Now, you've been with us for four weeks and every time we get attacked you're nowhere to be found!\" \n\n\"I get Irritable bowel syndrome and this means sometimes I fee..\" Dave could barely get the words out of his mouth before Julian grabbed him by the collar and started shouting again. \n\n\"Dave this is a war! Don't you understand?! People are dying! You haven't killed a single zombie have you? Dammit we lost two people yesterday!\" Julian stopped as a loud alarm started to blare. People began running to their defensive positions ready for the next wave. \"This is it! The big attack! Dave now is the time, now is the time to help. Forget everything and join us, grab your gun and let's go\" \n\nDave looked up at Julian, he heard the shrill screeches of the approaching undead horde.

        "John liked the moon, cracked as it now was. \nRose loved running. \nEve would always so caring. \n\nWe couldn't keep on living in this world. Surviving was too hard. Living, was too hard. We just got tired. \n\nI keep asking myself what the point of living is, if you just barely manage to. We thought there'd be other people, but we've travelled for years and found no one. No animals either. Just the trees. And their fruits. \n\nRose and Eve were barren. \n\nIt was obvious. After years of hoping that children could motivate us to live, we accepted that fact. It was probably the fruit that did it. And the constant dreams.... it was like the world didn't want us here. Turns out our survival instinct can only keep going for so long. \n\nIt was John who suggested it first. He said that there was nothing left for us here. Living was such a struggle and for what? Just to struggle again another day? This didn't convince me, but what he said next did. \n\nWhat if there was something after death? What if that is why life is such a struggle. What if we are being urged towards death by everything around us, because that is where we are supposed to be.

        "\"HURGH!\" \n\nA mostly clear, yellowish torrent spilled out of my gaping maw onto the creature's head. The only thing that made the situation slightly more dignified for all involved was that its nictating membranes closed just before the concoction of bile and stomach acid could cause an unpleasant stinging. \n\nI quickly turned aside, and motioned with what I hoped was an easily understood gesture of apology mixed with distress, and heaved once more. Damn, I usually don't have this level of gastric distress until ten hours after getting this plastered. Part of my alcohol addled brain burbled something about radiation, but that was surely foolishness. \n\nThe being in front of me - at least two feet shorter than me, with grey-brown leathery skin and large eyes the color of roasted chestnuts - began wiping itself down, what I could see of its face wearing a mask that on a human would indicate disgust and mild embarrassment. It chittered something in a clicking language that I couldn't understand - well, until I suddenly had the mother of all hangover headaches, like a sledgehammer between the eyes. Right then, I could make out.... not words, but the impression of language. If I could put into some kind of actual words, it would be like *why is it always puke? * \n\n\"Hey man.... uh, ma'am.... er, guy.... I mean, your the one who all'close encountering' barely two blocks from the pub on a weekend.

        "Monica raced down the wet London alleyway. She pulled her hooded robe tight as the unusual summer storm picked up. Thunder boomed. She quickened her pace. She stopped, coming to a fork. No one had mentioned forks. This was exactly why Monica rarely ventured above ground. Forks. Everyone knew forks were bad luck of course. It was so shiny amidst the darkness. It was probably a salad fork, perhaps a human red fish monster fork. Lightning flashed, illuminating the alleyway. She look up and saw a fork. \n\n\u201c Well shit, \u201d said Monica. The alley grew dark again. She approached the split road, careful to walk around the fork. Glaring at it once more she mustered some courage and also now craved delicious human red fish monster. \n\nMumbling to herself she produced a wand from under her sleeve. She closed her eyes and held her wand out to each path. Coming to an unseen understanding with the alley she summoned her will and whispered something unpleasant sounding. \n\n\u201c Dafooquityboop! \u201d said Monica. She flicked her wrist. Her wand surged out blue mist that contorted into a shape oddly reminiscent of a dolphin with 32 specific ways to say \u2018 oh god please help please help these humans have imprisoned me, oooh is that a fish?'\n\nLovable movie icon Flipper, turned to face the right fork. Monica kept her wand raised forgetting to release the spell and took off down the left path. Flipper disintegrated painfully and said something in dolphin. Probably something happy. \n\nStorm clouds escalated, dampening her visibility. She arrived at a dead end with a huge oak door and a single dim lantern. Monica tensed as an unwelcome shadow played at the edge of the light. \n\n\u201c Leave me alone old man, \u201d said Monica. A bearded beggar stepped out of the darkness. His violin had as many string as he had teeth. Four. Which was all of them. But he was really bad at playing so it was still painful. \n\n\u201c Change? I could be blind you know, I was a hiding in the shadows over there, \u201d he said -- looking right at her. He raised his eyebrows hopefully as if this was a solid persuasion. \n\nMonica grimaced.

        "Larson noticed the breach before anyone else. It was mere happenstance really, the recollection of an image at the right time, a fusion of two distinct times and places, but sharing the same meaning, that led to it. \n\nHe had spent long hours sitting behind a computer screen, the days merging like the endless applications and programs in front of him. Larson was a security analyst for a major contractor, and he held a great deal of responsibility for the numerous processes under his supervision. He was staying after hours, as he often did. He liked the solitude of his cubicle after most of the other people had left and felt he could concentrate on his work much better. He enjoyed the certain rhythmic zen nothingness that only people who have spent many hours programming or deep in thought in another craft can know. \n\nOne day while he was looking through a file subfolder, he got a phone call from his boss. The contracting company he worked for was involved in contracts with not only important businesses, but with government and military clients as well. Larson answered the phone and heard his boss's angry, boisterous voice yell out at him: \n\n\"God damn it, Larson. I've had it up to fucking here with you. Are you at the office?\" \n\n\"Yes, I had more work to do --\" Larson mustered the courage to speak. How had he known he was looking at the Buffalo File? \n\n\"I knew it. What the hell are you doing in the Buffalo File? You fucking know it's off limits. And what the hell are you doing at the office at this hour? I don't know what I pay you for, sometimes.\" \n\n\"I'm sorry. I'm just doing a routine sweep --\" \n\n\"I'll tell you what you're fucking doing. You're wasting air and water and electricity on my fucking dollar. You're fucking fired, that's what you are. You have until tomorrow morning to get out.\" \n\nThat was the end of the conversation. Larson started to shake, but that was soon overcome by sheer habituation that drove him look again at the file. He double-clicked the folder and began scanning the list of files. It wasn't anything rational that drove him to do this, as rationality has long since left his brain, ever since he had come across the file from his dream. \n\nThe second part of Larry's vision came from many years earlier, before Larry was a security contractor, or really much of anything at all except a lousy deadbeat who mooched off his parents and smoked a lot of dope.",

Where the HELL is our support? \u201d The Commander looked at Private Jackson, nodding in agreement. \u201c Big Dog, this is Overlord again, I hate to say this but all available support you have is on the main line holding back this sudden enemy attack. You'll have no air support, no ground support, and no artillery support. \u201d The message stunned the once powerful tank crew. \u201c Jackson, give me the damn radio. \u201d The Commander then proceeded to call Overlord. \u201c Overlord, this is Big Dog's commander. What the hell do you mean we have no support?

        "\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3 is going to win me an Oscar, through whatever means possible.\" I had said to myself earlier in my hotel room. \n\nNow here I am, standing tall and proud at the podium, facing a crowd of familiar faces.

I try to back away in order to escape, only to find myself cornered and pressed up against the fifteen foot replica of my award. I can feel their weight on me now, pinning my arms to the floor, I decide that it's not worth resisting. \n\nInstead, I crane my neck to look toward the podium where I was just moments before and spot beside it the lifeless body of the false winner, Mathew McConaughey. The man I strangled for all to see. The man who did not deserve to win this award. \n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3 is going to win me an Oscar, through whatever means possible.\"",
        "\"What the hell?\" I was working late trying to plan my next lesson when I heard a faint scratching noise followed by something falling right behind my bookshelf. God dammit, I can't get rats! I better take a look. I barely make it out of my chair and stumble over to the bookshelf. I listened closely \n\nNothing. \n\nI decide to get a closer look and try to move the bookshelf, but it's too heavy. I didn't put half of these books here as they were left here by a previous professor. I took a mental note to get rid of them after tonight. \nI start taking the books of the shelves when I see a clich\u00e9 come to life before my eyes. One of the books, slides out and I hear a cranking noise. The bookshelf starts to rise, and there is light seeping in from under the rising shelf. What the fuck? I thought to myself. The light was white, and clean. \nClunk. \nI could see that the bookshelf was raised all the way up, and I could enter if I chose. \nBut should I? \nMy heart is beating vivaciously. I want to see what's down there. I take my first step into the stark white room. I see a white mouse scuttle across the stairs. \nThis is too unsettling. I finish descending the stairs for what seems like an eternity. I look around. Bunk beds? \n\nWait, are those people? \n\n\"Yes we are.\" \nThe people turn over and show themselves. They are children with sleeping masks on.",
        "The angels had formed a circle around me to keep me from running, but they kept their distance cautiously. With a single snap of my fingers, I could wipe every angel out of existence, and they knew it, too. Once again I doubled over, trying to catch a breath that was miles ahead of me. \n\nA gentle hand touched my back. \"Hey,\" a melodic voice whispered, \"you'll be fine. There is no reason to worry.\" \n\nThe archangel Michael stood behind me, smiling a practiced smile that told me he wasn't quite sure of his own words, either. Me? A god? I neither earned, nor deserved the power. \n\nI laughed sarcastically. \"Yeah, sure, everything's fine. I die, at the age of eighteen, mind you, and I come up here to a ring of winged humans greeting me and calling me'God'.\" \n\nMichael shrugged, his bright eyes bored, like he's done this a million times. \"The Lord works in-\" \n\n\"If you say'mysterious ways', I swear, I will smite you wear you stand.\" I warned, letting my anger consume me. All my life, I concealed my anger, playing the part of the nice girl that was always calm, when in reality, I was a mess. \n\nI am no better than I was in my past-life, in fact, I was a screw-up. I was a nice girl. Was. I wanted a taste of what my friends got almost daily, the excitement, the joy, and the attention.",
        "\"Shit! It escaped again!\" Captain Richards cried out. He, along with Corporal Willis, were running down a white corridor. The lights flickered, and hushed whispers could be heard from all angles. \"Captain, whats going on?!\" Willis yelled. \"Shit...\" Richards trailed off. \"CAPTAIN?!\" Willis cried. Richards grabbed Willis and turned his head around, \"It's here....\" He whispered. They slowly walked south, the sound of footsteps getting louder. A loud creaking noise coming from the roof filled Willis with dread. \"Captain...\" Willis inquisited, trembling. \"Yes, Willis?\" Richards asked, not realising the situation. \"It's....It's above us...\" Willis said in a muted tone. Suddenly, a team of soldiers appeared from a door about ten metres away. \"Sentinel team 2 here, Russian division! Identify yourselves!\" yelled out one of the soldiers. A sickening crack was audible to all of the soldiers.",
        "How about Bruce, picking through the dumpster for some delicious Italian leftovers. His skin looks like it's never even heard of water, his hair unkempt to say the least. He diligently digs the trash pile in hopes of gourmet. The sweat from his forehead glistens in the sun like a rabid dog about to attack a small child. Damn it is hot here in the NYC this time of year. Bruce's dirty attire loosely clings to his sticky, dirt layered skin. His stench could be felt for miles, meaning that if you were to get your nose within millimeters of an unwashed butthole, Bruce would still smell so bad, you'd have to hang your head and break out the the peppermint oil in hopes that your nose was not broken and you still had the ability to smell. There he was, happily dunking himself into the ocean of trash that lay inside the garbage can. All of the sudden, he hears some huge sound. A thunderous crash and boom, followed by a blinding flash of light and smoke before him, an opaque staircase leading up into the orange and blue tinted, cloud covered sky presented itself outside the rust covered, dented up dumpster. After Bruce shit and pissed his hole ridden jogging pants, he took a deep breathe and studied the stairs. Were they just for him? Where did the come from and such? The only way to find out, Bruce fell out of the dumpster and staggered up the stairs. When he got halfway up, he paused. He could hear the faint sound of a choir. The sound was so beautiful and unlike anything he had ever heard before.",
        "Steven felt the blood drain from his face. \"H-how? ``, he stammered. \n\n\n\"What do you mean,'how'?\". Karen grinned, thrusting the crude drawings in front of his face. \"I had to practise of course\" she said, lazily gesturing towards the green mass in the corner of the room. \"I knew though, I knew you would be a success.\" \n\n\nFor the first time, Steven raised his eyes to meet hers. \"I...\" he paused, \"I thought we were friends.\" Karen snorted nastily. \"*Friends? * You thought we were *friends? *\". She closed the last clasp on his collar and placed her hand on his cheek. \"You are my greatest achievement, my pride and joy; and if you perform well tomorrow, we will be far more than *friends*.\" She patted him gently, and turned to leave. \"Sleep well.\" \n\n\nSteven tried to stand, but the chain yanked him painfully back into his seat. The door began to close as Karen stepped through it, the light leaving with her. \"Wait!\" he screamed, but she did not. The door creaked as it closed, condemning the room to darkness, and him with it. He clawed at the collar with his remaining hand, pulling in vain until fatigue defeated him, tears flooding down his cheeks. \n\n\nA voice spoke out in the darkness. \"So,\" it said, \"A man wishes to reconsider my offer?\".",
        "Sizz'ag'aar could feel his swim bladder pulsing with agitation at the oppressively warming, blindingly bright emissions of the lights in front of him. It was never a pleasant sensation, but he had become used to it with the passage of time and, he supposed, been conditioned to \"perform\" for the humans when they presented him with the lights. \n\nHe was still puzzled by the lights. For the last several orbits of this world around it's host star, the humans had insisted on shining them upon him, practically every time he went anywhere and attempted to replicate their speech sounds. Back on the homeworld, bright light was an indicator of a deadly solar eruption, a distressingly common occurrence on Klethoom. Here, though, there was no such negative connotation to the lights. The very first time he had thought it was a hostile gesture, that he had been discovered and that they were going to incinerate him. But it had not been long before he realized that this was just another barbaric practice the humans inflicted upon one another. Certainly not all of the humans merited having the lights shined down on them, but many humans, especially those deemed important, seemed to have to endure it. He took it as an indicator of his skill as an impostor that he seemed to have worked his way into a position where the humans saw him as light-worthy, though he was rather unhappy with the frequency with which they insisted he be illuminated. \n\nThe human standing under the text-screen, next to the large black lens-box, gestured at him in sequence with his human digits - first all five of the ugly, unwebbed fingers, then four, than three, until there were no fingers left. This was one of many unspoken indicators he had picked up during his many orbits living amongst this world's natives, and he knew it was time for him to begin imitating the humans' speech sounds. \n\n\"I want to thank you all for coming today. I particularly want to thank our Secretary of Education for traveling with me...\" \n\nIf he had been asked by a fellow Klethoomian, Sizz'ag'aar would have freely admitted he had never had much of a talent for xeno-linguistics - especially with a species whose speech anatomy was a foreign as these humans'. Despite having spent the majority of his adult lifespan on this arid, thin atmosphered rock, he had never fully picked up any of the various human dialects here.",
        "With the window broken, the white curtains danced with the wind, the red of it now growing from his perifories toward the center of his vision, closing in. He seethed, his back flexing like an acordian. He ran his hands through his sweat-soaked hair. \"You knew\", he said said through gritted teeth. \"You knew.... from the start.\" He knew deep in the middle of his brain, further than he could reach, that he must be angry. He must rage and fight until he can't. Outrage is the last stronghold of self deception. She hugged her legs leaning on the headboard. Her body language looked fearful but her face said something else. Her eyes were wide with a far away gaze of long awaited understanding. He heard a door clse from far away and darken the light inside his head.",
        "I stood there in my underwear looking at myself. It wasn't an easy life that I had chosen. The stress of my job had left me balding early. The bags under my eyes had only grown larger and don't even get me started about the stress eating. I could pack away an entire pig. I'm serious, an honest to god entire pig. I heard a knock on my door and sighed. It was Samson again. It was always Samson my secretary. \u201c Just a minute. \u201d It wasn't even dawn and here he was knocking at my door. I hastily put on my Mayor's robe and with a great reluctance opened the door. \n\nThere he was. He was a muscular lad kind of like how I used to be before I took this job. He had long flowing hair. I hated his hair. I used to have long flowing hair, granted mine was brown and not blonde but still. Samson looked up at me with his shining blue eyes. \u201c We\u2026 We have a problem sir. \u201d He paused for a second so I could rub my temples and winch. We always had problems. It never failed but I guess that's just to cost of doing business with a dark lord rising to power in the south. He waited for my eyes to open again. \u201d The blacksmith seems to have made a seemingly endless number of wooden sticks. \u201d \n\nI blinked twice and opened my mouth to say something. I immediately shut it without saying a word. I needed a second to collect my thoughts. There were after all so many questions. \u201d How does one make a stick? \u201d Samson looked like he was about to answer but I raised a hand to cut him off. \u201c That was a rhetorical question. We deal with this problem every year. Did he also make a ridiculously large amount of cloth armor? \u201d Samson just quietly nodded his head. \u201c Ok, You have him take his sticks and cloth armor and give them to the item shop. Tell him that we've solved the tent issue since that one guy passed through and bought a few hundred of them. \u201d \n\nSamson nodded his head in understanding. \u201d A most wise action sir. Now, there is the issue of all the debri outside of town. It would seem that some hooligans trashed a couple hundred tents and just left the trash along with the corpses of hundreds of animals outside as well. \u201d Samson looked down at his clipboard to make sure that he didn't miss anything. \u201c Ah, also it would appear that it is drawing the undead. \u201d \n\nKeep breathing. That's the key just keep breathing. It never fails a group of people come through here buy a ton of tents and I swear to god instead of reusing a tent they just destroy it. I've seen them do it. They've done it in front of me. Right outside the town. They just set up the tent sleep in it for the night and then destroy it. Seriously, how wasteful are you? It's insane. It's madness. We could have used those tents. \u201c Ok, Samson write this down. First, I want increased guard presence in the town and around the perimeter. No one gets in without first being checked for bites. If someone is found to be bitten take them to the priest. \u201d I clutched my stomach. There went the ulcer again. \u201c After that I want you to take what guards we have left and whatever volunteers you can get and burn as much of the debri as you can. \u201d I watched Samson finish writing that down. \n\n\u201c Masterfully taken care of sir. \u201d Samson turned to the next page. \u201d Ah, on a somewhat related note our priest has discovered that he holds power over life and death. I'm afraid he's gone quite mad. In fact, he's declaring himself some kind of god right now.",

        "\"So what do you guys have?\" Anna asked. Aliens had come to earth due to some sort of galactic terror, and humans had agreed to work with them if the aliens combined their technology with ours. Sadly, since their ship had crashed on earth, they couldn't use any parts from the unsalvagable wreckage. Only what the aliens chose to bring. \n\n\"By means of defense,\" Nova, the head alien, gurgled. She had learned English the fastest, and therefore sufficed as a translator and the leader of the group. \"We have this.\" \n\nShe withdrew a gun from her pocket. It was made of some type of white metal, and green glass allowed one to get a partial aerial view of the number of glowing green orbs in a chamber. She aimed the gun at the wall and fired. \n\nLike a flash of lightning, a green orb flew from the gun, with a string around its middle. The bullet-like object didn't get too far before being stopped by the string. Nova's eyes, which contained the same colors as the body of a peacock, held great embarrassment as she attempted to place the orb back into the gun. However, it cracked, gooey purple liquid oozing onto her rubber gloves as she quickly ate the remnants of the green bullet, almost as though she had consumed her shame. \n\nThe alien's unnaturally pale skin flushed red all over, proclaiming to the world that she was flustered.",
        "It was peaceful, really. The engines died what felt like days ago, but there was no frame of reference for that anymore since the ship computer died. The passage of a day felt meaningless anyway without a rising and setting sun. Food was impossible since the rehydrator was shot. He wasn't sure if he'd eat it anyway. Even if the beacon worked, there was no one left. He'd just be prolonging the inevitable, drifting out into the black expanse. \n\nBut it was peaceful. He didn't feel hunger or thirst anymore. Just tired. The stars in every direction were like a visual lullaby, gleaming through the omnidirectional windows.",
        "I was fifteen at the time. I never understood why everyone was so deeply infatuated with one another. Love never really meant much to me. Growing up you're taught that a mother's love for her child goes beyond worlds. In vice-versa, a child's love for it's mother transcends dimensions. I was different, though. I had never felt love, or compassion. My family pets would come and go. Live and die. Family members would drop off the planet like flies to a zapper, but I would always be the one sitting on that uncushioned bench, wearing a freshly pressed suit, unwavered by what was placed in front of me. Death. I guess that carried over with me in a lot of other things. Love. Friendship. Pride. It was all masked by this feeling deep within almost, in a way, coming from nowhere and at the exact same time in a very distinct part just behind my sternum. It was a feeling of absence. In more of a way, I guess, it was a feeling of uncarring. Nothing mattered to me because I felt, well, nothing. Through the last years of highschool all of the people I associated my self around, to appear normal, were going off with their dates. Just watching the three of them getting into a car, taking turns over whose date night it was with whose. It disgusted me. Love was never meant for me. It seemed. Nothing was. \n\nUntil I met, her. Her name was Alysian (a-le-see-an). It was cute. Elegant. A name that caught your ear when you heard it. When I had met her I asked for her name at least five times over. It never wanted to role off my tongue until I finally blurted out Aslan. This amused her quite a bit and from this her nickname \"Lion\" was born. We had talked it over with her and her boyfriend, Trey, and they agreed to add me to their relationship. It was nice for awhile. Just us three. Everything was finally starting to feel normal to me. I had gotten a job over the summer at the local Lowe's Hardware Store. Bought a car nearing the end of it and we had all spent nearly every weekend with each other. Lion, Trey, and I all happy together. At the end of the summer we all talked about moving in with eachother when we graduate. Being the seniors that we were, we couldn't wait to set this plan into motion. \n\nGraduation came. The class of 2013 had finished saying their goodbyes with eye filled tears to one another. Some will be seeing each other at various community colleges around the state, but for most this was the end and they knew that.",

        "I looked Brad in the eyes and he looked back at me. I saw everything in that moment: fear, recognition, surprise, relief and finally pleading. His hands shook in the air, from exhaustion or fear I couldn't tell. \n\nI thought back on how it used to be, Brad and I tearing up the town when our only concern used to be either filling our bed for the night or at least settling for not remembering it. So much has changed since then. \n\nWhen it all went down, I didn't even have time to contact Brad. Phones stopped working, he lived across town, there was madness etcetera, etcetera. For multiple reasons we never met up and I always regretted it. With him by my side we could've raised hell, torn up the town again for real. \n\nNow though, he wore scraps. He had a plastic bag filled with cans, torn jacket on his back and ripped sneakers on his feet. His beard had grown out, something he never would've willfully let happen, and there was dirt covering what features I could see. Still though, it was Brad, there was no mistaking that. \n\nSuddenly a shot rung out and Brad collapsed to the floor; all those emotions suddenly draining out of him like the blood pooling on the floor. I watched in horror as his head slammed the cement with a sense of finality that sickened me. \n\nThe gun felt hot in my hand. A shell clanged to the floor. \n\n\"Enough standing around!\"",

        "To me, it felt the same as opening my eyes. But in reality, some part of my conciousness within this machine had activated the camera and adjusted the focus of the lense. Within seconds I had mapped the room in three dimensions, identified all the objects in the room, and pulled background info on all people in the room. The person sitting directly across from me, was me. \n\nIt's an odd sensation to find yourself staring back at yourself, when there is no mirror present.

However, it required the cooperation of the me across from me to be carried out, as I did not have a body.

        "my older brother was never what I'd call a \"burden.\" he was hard to deal with sometimes; getting his shoes on was a chore, but outside of that, it was rare for him to be difficult. mom had the hardest time with it. the joy of the challenge had long since worn off for her. raising a developmentally challenged boy was just something she wasn't cut out for. \n\nthe first day of summer came on a thursday. school had been out for a full week, so jerry'd been running around with no shoes on daily and was getting out of his school year routine. on blackened soles, he ran enthusiastically around the neighborhood during the day and played twister by himself at night: we told him it was how people did yoga. \n\nthat was the day he explored the neighborhood to intently; too thoroughly. I'm not sure when the nickolas family noticed him standing in their sunroom, I'm not even 100 % sure what they were doing that made him react the way he did.

I imagine they didn't lure him into their home with the express purpose of doing what they did to him. I can't imagine it was intentional. \n\nempathy is all that makes me able to understand what happened. I know how they must have just snapped in that moment and lost all grip on sanity for the rest of their lives. the reporters said that the only comment they really made regarding what they had done was, \"You haven't lived until you've had some nicely grilled retard.",
        "In a post-apocalyptic Earth, whose climate has been wrecked by centuries of environmental degradation resulting in a new Ice Age, children are the most valuable resource. To protect humanity's future from those who would exploit or destroy it, the world's most brilliant remaining scientists genetically engineer a guardian for each child out of the only remaining land life forms capable of surviving Earth's near-constant sub-zero temperatures: polar bears. \n\n\nSpecifically designed to have increased intelligence, the ursine defenders are also given the ability to psychically transmit feelings of euphoria and relaxation to those who would threaten \"their\" child, thus rendering them harmless. Despite these abilities, the perilous world of Earth's future remains a constant threat to the surviving humans, and it is only by learning to work together can they survive -- with the help, that is, of their genetically modified CARE BEARS.",
        "It started slowly at first, for a second I thought it was just my imagination or even some sort of static in the field that held time still. I brushed it off, thinking it was simply something in the corner of my eye. Then, it happened again. The next time I used my ability, I noticed it again. Some sort of fast movement, this time not in the corner of my eye but in the middle of a field off in the distance. I had used my power whenever I needed alone time alone, and by time I mean real time, time that had nothing moving in it. Time that was pure, clean, and untarnished by the constant bustling of mankind, or the universe in general. Whenever I used it, it was far from a localized event. All across the universe, everywhere in existence, stood still. And there I was. \n\nIt wasn't like you would picture it, I didn't just walk around and do random things, after all movement takes time when you think about it. I was just there, every thought in my head had no \"time\" to move or change, whenever I froze it there I was with the same attitude, ideas, and thoughts I had the instant I froze it. It usually was seamless, flawless; no difference could be detected in anything. As far as I knew, I was the only being in existence that truly knew the feeling of pure privacy, unhampered by the beat of a heart or the flow of motion. \n\nWhatever it was, it didn't seem... Or feel... Human. Every time it showed up, there was something about it that was wrong, and I knew it.... Both of the most recent times I had seen the apparition were when I had used my ability near a field, or open place on earth. It seemed strange that something like that would be restrained to certain spots on earth, which was so easily forced into submission by a person like myself. It made me wonder, was I the only one who knew of my ability, or was there somebody who knew how to counter it or even harness it? \n\nAfter the fourth time I had caught a glimpse of the thing, I was sitting in a coffee shop in a lonely little town out in the middle of farm country. Everything was bustling along as intended, had time been passing normally it would have been nearly a billion years since these people had last had a heartbeat.",
        "1st December, 1962. \n\nI am stuck on a train out of Kent bound for the West-coast. Snow has damned the tracks for miles. \nI am sat with 30 others, coddled under a solitary blanket, warming myself with memories. \nThe snow is setting on the window outside of my compartment. \n\n\n\nOf all the days for this storm to pick-up. \n\nI will be seeing Eliza tomorrow, I am sure of it. The conductor has told me we will be moving come morning, whenever that may be. Outside of my window, I can see white settling upon itself; I can not tell where the window ends and the abyss begins. How can one tell the time when the sun does not shine? That feint thing, hiding from my view. I am assured it is late-noon, but it does not feel so. I am suspended, Eliza. For only had you been here. My fantasies of you play upon my heart. That we should share this compartment and laugh. You will calm me, and together we would recline into each other. Such thoughts warm my blood, but little good for my extremities, for the most distant parts of myself have lost sensation. \n\nThe conductor has told me we have been stranded for 9 hours. Of what little sleep I have had, I can take no more. The dreams, Eliza, the dreams. I do not know what it is called when your fondest memories sharpen themselves like knives and gullet your innards, but such a description I think comes close. When does a nightmare become a nightmare? I taunt myself Eliza, but I do not panic. My vision is choked by clouds and pale colours of glass; so large and fluid, no beginning, no end. A nightmare within a dream, is it not? For I nearly screamed when I awoke from my sleep. That you were here. By my side as I lay asleep. And off, off into this hellish infernal you float that traps me so. I do not stir, but I know you are gone and I die. I am found fifty-years later, frozen and still alive. I am looking at me.",
        "A sudden stinging in his hand roused him from his contemplative staring. Right between his index finger and his middle finger. The cigarette had burned right down to his hand again as he sat in the overstuffed armchair in the living room. \n\n\nReflexively, the cigarette dropped to the floor onto the carpet. It's glowing ember immediately left a black dot on the red carpet beneath him. He moved his foot over and squashed the ember with his sneaker; there were now eight more or less identical dots in a random pattern on the living room floor. \n\n\nHe had been sitting there thinking all night. He was lonely, afraid. \n\nThe sirens frightened him. \n\n\nOut on the city street a police siren blared its obnoxious alarm, first coming down the street, growing louder and louder, rising to a screeching pitch, and then gradually fading away. \n\n\nHe missed the comfort of Alice's voice. Even amid all the others, the missed the soothing, distinctly feminine voice. Its high pitched, naturally female noise cutting above the garbled mess below. \n\n\nSoaring if not covering the garbled, nasty baritone of the bad voices. The bad voices he had gotten used to; he had ignored. \n\n\nHe squinted, spying the orange cylinder on the kitechen sink. Did he take them this morning? He couldn't remember. He remembered taking them yesterday morning; but what about last night? \n\n\nHe felt miserably lonely. \n\n\nHe wanted a comforting voice to soothe him. \n\n\nShe soared so high above the rest did it even matter? He could ignore the rest, he had learned to do that years ago. \n\n\nThe apartment around him was so grimy and the police sirens sounded on the streets below..it seemed like every ten minutes. \n\n\nShe was an angel and he couldn't hear her any more.",
        "I watched the news as Senator Henry grinned. \"Congress has voted to make me speaker of the house. I am now speaker of the house. It was a unanimous decision to make me speaker of the house.\" \nI wrinkled my forehead. \n\nI guess it would be a big deal to win a spur of the moment election like that, and I'm sure the guy was happy, but damn. We get it. You're speaker of the house. I flipped through the channels and turned on some brain dead cartoon that would hopefully make me laugh and keep me awake. A job the news was failing at. I rocked my crying daughter, Victoria, who I sometimes just called Tory in my head. She was three months old and loved to cry. Scream really. And I hated for my wife to have to rock her in the dead of night. \n\nMy wife, Kate, was always exhausted. She was kind, smart, loving, and exhausted. She worked longer hours than I did. Sometimes going to work before the sun came up and coming home after it had gone down. But she didn't mind. Sometimes I worried she would grow resentful that I only worked 8 hours a day and had so much more time with Tory. But she never did. Instead, every other Friday for the last 8 months, she would beam and show me her savings account. Each time it would grow $ 100 and she would almost fight back tears. The account was named \"Victoria's School.\" When I first saw it, I had to fight back tears too. \n\nSo that's how I usually lost all my sleep, letting Kate get hers. \n\nThe next morning, after I dropped Tory off at day care, I was listening to the radio. \"In other news, a lawyer in Chicago got his client off a double murder sentence because he reminded the judge and jury that George Washington said it was okay to murder your neighbors if they're sleeping with your wife. And the Cincinnati zoo is welcoming a baby hippo to their family!\" \n\nI almost slammed on the breaks. What? I pulled into the parking lot at work and whipped out my phone. I searched it and it came up immediately. A lawyer shaking hands with a man who looked like he carried years of anger and regret. \"Not Guilty!\" The headline screamed. I rubbed my temple. A little further down, I saw an even less sane headline. \"President Jacks steps down as commander in chief and hands his position to Senator Henry.\" \n\nI read that too. Apparently after a private conversation, President Jacks agreed that Henry would do a better job.\" \n\nI shook my head, but got out of my car and went to work. I worked at Leo's Used Cars, where the deals are cerrrrazy. Deals, psht! More like swindles. I haven't seen a vehicle here that I would ever buy. So to sell them to people with terrible credit and low income always made me feel slimey. But I've only been here a year and a half and I'm the top sells man. I'm a great liar. I could sell ice to an Eskimo. \n\nThroughout the day, I sold 7 vehicles. New record. Enough commission to meet Kate on Tony's savings and pay for a day off with her. And today was ridiculously easy. I would lie and say the vehicle had great gas milage, and they would believe me. Or that the tires were brand new, and I would even look down and believe it. Once or twice, I would say \"it's a great car,\" and it seemed it was shinier, sleeker, and just better. \n\nI couldn't believe my luck. On my way home, after picking up Tory, again I listened to the radio. \"Newly appointed Chief Justice Henry has accepted the position.\" Again I shook my head. This guy couldn't be the president and the Chief Justice. Or at least, I didn't think so. \n\nOnce parked in the driveway, I looked up the news article. No, a different Henry. But, in a picture of the new Chief Justice Henry and President Henry shaking hands, they looked just alike. Then I understood. They were brothers. I wondered why the country wasn't outraged. Where were the riots and outpouring of confusion? Then I asked myself how I felt. Not angry, maybe a little shocked. But it just made sense. As if it were perfectly understandable that there is a new president and his brother is now Chief Justice. \n\nI felt even more confused. But I simply took Tory inside and gave her a bath. I then got dinner ready and waited for Kate. Once she came home, I was so excited to tell her about my good luck at work, that I didn't even notice how down she looked. \n\n\"I sold 7 cars today.\" I told her, the first thing I said after kissing her hello. \n\n\"That's good,\" she replied, sounding sullen. She took a deep breath and looked down. \"I got fired today.\" \n\nI was floored. No, we weren't going hungry, but we relied heavily on her job. I know my exasperation showed on my face, because she immediately started crying. Quick to take her in my arms, I consoled her. \"It's okay, it's okay, we'll be fine. We barely needed your job anymore. I can support us. I'll take care of us.\" I whispered over and over again until she stopped crying. When she looked up, I saw she looked less exhausted. More relieved. And even though I was worried so did I. \n\nThat night, Tory started crying as usual. And even though I still had work tomorrow, I still went to her and let Kate rest. I sat with her, watching the news again.",
        "They are at the dock. Ben is watching the horizon, waiting for the ferry to arrive. The breeze comes cold off the water, off the lake. Behind him Duluth sits in a bank fog. Strong beams of sunlight pierce the clouds and reflect off the windows of buildings along the waterfront. A woman takes Ben's hand. Emily, her hair up, her eyes wide. She is wearing a heavy down coat. \n\nAren't you cold? she says. She takes his parka from a suitcase and hands it to him. He pulls it on over his suit. Snow begins to fall from the fog and in the thin lines of morning sun the flakes sparkle like diamonds. \n\nWhen will we get there? Emily says. \n\nBen reaches into his pocket and pulls out his ticket. Tomorrow, he says. \n\nWhat? \n\nBen looks up, but now his wife is gone. Instead, his son, middle-aged and balding and soggy at the midsection, is spreading butter on a wedge of bread. They are in a dining room, and it looks familiar, but Ben can not remember why. Tomorrow, Ben says again. \n\nWhat's tomorrow? his son says. He takes a bite out of the piece of bread. Crumbs tumble from his mouth. Why are you wearing two shirts?",
        "I uh, I've never believed in an after life.... or God. I never went to church, I didn't believe in any of that stuff. I didn't think there could be with all the shit that's happened in my life. Countless sufferings I've endured throughout it all. How could there be a God in such a shit world. A world where a parent dies giving birth to her only son. A world where a father is allowed to keep a child despite still being deeply affected by the death of his wife and turning to booze. A world where CPS sees nothing wrong with the bruises or the child's living conditions which contains not a single toy for the child to play with. Instead of toys the child turns to torturing bugs which run rampant in the tiny apartment that CPS deemed as \"good enough.\" A child who is bullied by other kids over the fucking over sized thrift shop clothes, bought on the 75 % off days where the clothing options are more limited due to them restocking the next day, that he wears. Also bullied to the fact that during recces no one would go near him let alone play with the kid so he would play in the mud with the worms and ants that live there. Perhaps everyone saw it coming that \"bug boy\" himself would become an exterminator. Not just bugs though, rats, raccoons, the occasional possum or two. I mean who expected more from him? Not his father of course, he died years before I got the job. Last thing I remember of him telling me is if I can drive his old man to the hospital, claiming he had extreme pain in his upper right chest area or something. I still remember his yellowing skin and eyes looking at me, in pain and with fact that he knew I wouldn't. He was holding onto the photo of my mother before they were married. I snatched that photo away and I left home that day, he stayed there and died on the couch. I found myself in New York city, with nothing but $ 20 in my pocket and a few pairs of dirty clothes I changed into every couple of days. I tried begging and finding work to no avail. Finally found a job that was in high demand and required little training, exterminating. Everyday something new and crazy. An entire apartment complex, an office on the 76th floor, even in the million dollar hipster homes in Brooklyn no where was free of pest in New York and I loved it. Sorta got a thrill from killing bugs and animals and shit. After a few years didn't get any thrill from trapping a family of rats and suffocating them in my plastic bag. Bugs were nothing to me, just things to be stepped on. Then it occurred to me that I might of mastered the art of killing pests and that I should try to move onto bigger fish. I quit work, after working there for so long working harder and longer then anyone else I had made a fairly large sum of money. It would last me a few months a year if I planned accordingly. I figured I start off small.",
        "The trail was only two miles to the top. The mountain was short and fat, and with that shape it offered thirty-five different trails to the top. Most were two to three miles apart, at least. The average distance a scream can actually travel, when bouncing off of the dense trees of Northern California, was barely a mile. \n\n6:00. The perfect timing for someone to find a companion, a friend forever or kinda forever. The trail offers many friends on the way up. A pair of hippies that offer him some trail mix. A middle aged couple, trying to escape the office but clearly annoyed with prolonged exposure to each other. They will break up soon. The last of the downers descended, a trio of high school girls in athletic shorts and revealing tank-tops. He undressed them with his eyes, and moved along to find someone who wanted to stay the night with him. Well, stay the night at least. \nThere were no friends that he could find, and boy was he lonely. Usually there is a bum or two in the summer months, sleeping off their loneliness in a poorly erected fort or a cardboard box. The box was a shape he looked for often. Its concrete angles screamed for attention among the contorted branches. But there were no cubes among the obtuse today. It was getting dark, and boy howdy was it getting lonely. \n\nA friend! He rejoices furtively into a tree, scratching beard into bark and breathing heavy heaves into the air. A tent, and one tent, too small for someone who already has a friend. It must be someone who is lonely. \n\nHe stares for about twenty minutes, until the sunset lost its sheen and purple night crept over the mountain sight. Friend had taken a piss and smoked a joint in those twenty minutes, probably eating afterwards before lying down to sleep. \n\nBy now my feet are going numb, so I don't crunch the leaves. It has been an hour since friend has gone to bed, and he seems awful quiet. I am his guest, and he is being rude as hell. My trench rustles, and underneath torn sweatpants that usually show my genitals but I wore my jockstrap today because I wanted to make a friend. \n\nThe tent is smooth. The man locks the drawstring of his sweatpants into place and licks the tent, and it is smooth. It tastes like music sounds, vibrations shooting into his tongue and rousing his heart into audibility. He twists his thumb between his right hand, and the urge to bite through the tent is too much. \n\nThe yellow of my nails stripped the zipper naked, until the veil was deveined and the sight was before me. My friend, my new friend who I just wanted to love and be friends with and talk to, had somehow decapitate himself and placed his own dick in his mouth. The blood seared through his camper blanket and it turns out my friend did not do this to himself, because, while I knelt, I felt steel rend flesh and canvas. \n\nA thin rod of steel had been gouged through the man in the trenchcoat and sweatpants, spit rod style. It exited through his body with a plop and ripped the zipper cleanly off of its frame. The culprit was clear.",
        "\"Oh, uh, Good evening detectives. Please, come in. Have a seat. Marie will be right out. She's calming down a bit....W- we got stirred up a bit when you called to come speak with us.\" \n\n\"Just relax, we'll take this nice and slow. We aren't here on any bad terms, simply, to ask you guys a few questions. I cant imagine a worse tragedy than losing a child. You can call the shots on the pace Mr. Bumgar --\" \n\n\"Dave. You c- can just call me Dave\u2026 And you?\" \n\n\u201c The name's Detective Phillip Tate. But I supose just Phillip will suffice. \u201d \n\nDave chuckled slightly too loudly and slightly too forcedly. \n\u201c Hah, no uh Detective Phillip Marlow? \u201d Dave joked. \n\n\u201c I'm sorry? \u201d Detective Tate looked up from the table he was arranging things from his hip bag on \n\n\u201c Oh\u2026 never-\u2026 He's a character in some old detective books. Written by, um, R-Raymond C-Chandlers. And you're both detectives so\u2026... \n\nThe stuffy silence in the small pallor room stopped at Dave's ears. A dull ringing had taken to gradually arising from silence to a piercing ringing that made Dave's eyes shake. This uncomfortable sensation enveloped him anytime he sat still and his thoughts ventured to his Ana. The ringing in his ears now was at a strong whine. Dave shifted uncomfortably against the rough seat cushion. \n\nThe buzz of a zipper whipped from a polished leather portfolio. Its screech bore into Dave Bumgarners skull like a drill. The click of a pen stabbed his gut. Papers, dragging over one another was like taking sandpaper to his shins. \n\n\u201c I'm gon na put on a fresh pot of coffee, \u201d Dave jolted up \u201c y'all want some? \u201d \n\n\u201c We're fine. Appreciate it though. \u201d \n\nDave entered the kitchen and slowly shuffled his ratty moccasins with the holes around both big toes across the first cold tile square. Grasping the doorjamb, Dave rolled his neck and sighed deeply. He had stayed up for 3 days straight in terror, with Marie, while an all-out manhunt searched for their daughter. Then another two nights were sleepless after they got the news. Dave's body creaked slowly across the dimly lit kitchen, where most of the light came from Marie's bright copper pots multiplying the light from a single countertop lamp. He looked down. Focusing on only \u201c L \u201d paths in the tiles. Two up, one over. Dave stood in the threshold of the dismal kitchen. The last warm vapors from delicious confectionaries have been gone for a long time. \n\nDave shuffled a few feet forward and stopped. He stood and calculated his potential moves. Like a grand chess master, Dave analyzed each move for himself, the weary and downtrodden knight. Looking down, he counted each tile. Right, Right, Up. No, that would take him to the refrigerator. Right, Right, Down. The very last place Dave wanted to go was back in there with the detectives... Back, Back, Left. Dave wanted more than anything for him to be moved Back Back Left. Then he could just grab his keys hanging by the door and drive away from here. Up, Up, Right. Nope.",
        "\"Qintar. That's 38...\" \n\n\"Challenge.\" Eric's hands snatched the dictionary up with lighting reflexes. He was not going to let another \"Qezo\" fiasco cost him his dignity again. \n\nThe slim section of the dictionary that was dedicated to the letter Q was finally looked through in earnest. Eric slowly closed it a moment later, \"Your turn, again.\" \n\n\"Thank you.\" Tamara proceeded to add to her score, now well ahead of Eric's. But Eric didn't have to see the piece of paper to know that he should feel dejected. As Tamara drew more letters from the bad Eric walked off to the kitchen to get a drink, or just to calm down; probably both. \n\nTamara studied the board and fidgeted with her seven tiles until Eric returned: drink in hand, but emotions still unchecked. Eric took a long look at the board as he sat down, and then, without taking his eyes away, did a double take. \"Hey! What do you think you're doing?!\" \n\n\"I'm planning...\" Tamara didn't look up from her tiles. \n\n\"No! You're moving letters around! You think I won't notice!\" Eric backed his accusation by pointing at the board, and nothing more. This wasn't enough for Tamara, who would have given him a blank stare if she could look up from the board. So Eric elaborated. \"See, look here. I played bend, right here, but now it says behind. And look here! You played hill, but now...\" Eric ran his finger over the newly formed word as he very clearly enunciated it.",
        "I didn't like her anymore. I didn't want to be with her anymore. I was done! I was free! I was finally on my own. \n\n\nThe hardest part of being on your own is actually being on your own and realizing that no one else was there to make me happy. I did miss her being there. I didn't miss her conversation or anything else about her really. She was kind of funny, kind of intelligent, and kind of kind. I felt myself wanting more though. I wanted to really laugh. I wanted to really think. I wanted to really be nice. In short, I wanted more out of the life I had. \n\n\nIt took a while to realize it with her, but we both had been feeling it for a while. That slow drag of monotony had just drank the fun from my life. Every day was a schedule. Get up. Walk the dog. Shower and get dressed. Pick up the carpool. Drive to work. Work. Lunch. Work. Drive carpool home. Pick up mail. Take out trash. Pick up take out from a locally recommended diner. Watch something on TV till we fell asleep. Have sex once a month. On the first Monday of the month, I could tell you exactly where I was going to be, what I was going to be doing, and with whom it would be, for the next 30 days. \n\n\nI didn't want that anymore. She didn't want that anymore. More importantly, we didn't want that with each other anymore. So, I moved out. I moved into an apartment closer to work. I don't have to carpool anymore. I just walk 15 minutes, take in some sun, and feel pleasantly refreshed. It's been two weeks. I'm getting more done at work. I am enjoying trying some restaurants I found in a book at the library. Oh yeah, I'm reading more now too. \n\n\nTwo weeks in, and I need to make the next step. I need to start moving on. I left my phone at our old place, but I just couldn't go back to get it. I mean, I want her to be happy and all, and I am genuinely happy for her, but there is a chance that I will lose my resolve and fall blissfully back into the warm hands of stagnation once more. At my lunch break, I head to the Apple store and buy a new phone. Working with the Apple Genius, we go through my options, and luckily, I had an iCloud backup I could sync my new phone with from my old phone. The Genius re-installed my apps and asked if he wanted to automatically re-accept all my permissions and settings. \n\n\nOn a whim, I said no.",
        "\"Smile, Jim!\" mother is happy as she pulls me through the fair. \"Jim, you like the sea, don't you?\" I nod, smudging ice cream on my nose. I like ice cream, mother says I liked it even when I was a baby. \"We can go there, Jim!\". \n\nWe stop at a bench and we sit down. There is a pond, and I look at the ducks. \"Jim, say it. Say how much you like the sea.\" I look up at mother then nod, uncertainly. \"I.... like the sea. I want to go to the sea.\" Mother smiles at me, and says something at the sky. Some of the words I know - ocean, child, trip. And some I don't - ewe-tilty ray-show? We sit on the bench, and after a while a car comes and takes us to the sea. Some people look funny at the car, I think because it is on on the path. They have to step off the path to let the car go past. \n\nAt the sea I swim in the waves with mother. We have a good time. Mother says I liked the sea even when I was a little baby. There is a boat, and mother tells me to say how much I like boats. The people in the boat get out, and we sail around the sea until the sun goes down and I am very tired and we go home. \n\nAt home we eat dinner, then we go to my room and I get into bed and mother tucks in the sheets.",
        "I tried to catch my breath as I took in what he'd said. \n\nA drop of blood fell across my eye from the cut I'd taken on the forehead and I angrily reached up to dash it away so it wouldn't impair my vision. I knew that it left a bright smear of red across my face and didn't care. All that mattered was the fight. \n\n\"Well?\" \n\nHe stood across from me, the clatter of battle around us had faded into the background. They'd cleared a ring of space for us as we fought, the intensity of our battle drawing a healthy amount of battlefield respect from them, even as they fought and died in their own battle. \n\nSoldiers knew. Knew what it was to appreciate skill and prowess so far beyond their own, even in the midst of their own desperate struggle for existence. \n\n``.... What?\" Even that word was a struggle to articulate. The battle had been going on all day and I was *tired*. \n\n\"Look at them, Solan,\" my opponent waved his hand out to the side, gesturing to all the others. \"They don't know why they're here, do they? They think they're here for their king, or their government, or their families. They fight for impure reasons and their battle is impure because of it.\" \n\nHe sheathed his sword, letting it glide back into the scabbard that hung from his belt. \n\n\"It's different with us. There's a reason they call you the'Berserker,' General.\" \n\n\"Put up your sword,\" I said through gritted teeth. \"Our fight isn't over yet.\" \n\n\"Yes, it is,\" he said, spreading his arms to the side, leaving himself vulnerable if I should choose to strike. \"I felt it from you, and I know you felt it here too. The purity. You and I are cut from the same cloth, Solan. We don't fight for any other reason than because we can. Because it's what we're good at. It's what we were born to do. This battlefield, Solan? It's unworthy of us. It's unworthy of men of our talents and skills.\" \n\nMy grip tightened on my sword. I longed to take that last step, thrust, put an end to this war. Despite the whims of the power mad king that had invaded, everyone knew that it was this man, their warleader, who was the tactical genius behind their strategies.",
        "The first thing I heard was the ice breaking open. The first thing I felt was myself falling out of the ice and landing in someone's arms. \n\nThe first thing I saw was her beautiful eyes. \n\nShe was the most perfect woman I had ever laid eyes upon. Her brown hair was braided in two loops on the side and they swayed in the chilling wind. She was wearing some strange looking Eskimo outfit, but she was not an Eskimo. I mustered what little strength I had left to ask her a question. \n\n\"I need to ask you something.\" It was quiet, raspy, but she heard me. \n\n\"What?\" She seemed concerned. \n\n\"Please,\" I wheezed. \"Come closer.\" \n\nShe leaned in. \"What is it?\" \n\nThen my voice returned fully. My face lit up as I asked \"Will you go sledding with me?\" She seemed taken aback. *Shit. Nice going. * I chastised myself internally. \n\n\"Uh.... sure? I.... I guess.\" *Well that's a yes at least. * \n\nAs I rose up from the ground I realized she was standing with a man with similar features. He was holding a gun, and he pointed it at me once I was standing, but I didn't care. My memories, or lack thereof, were coming back to me. \n\n\"What's going on here?\" \n\n\"You tell us!\" The man shouted. \"How'd you get in the ice? Why aren't you frozen?\" \n\n\"I.... I don't know.\" I was starting to get really weirded out, as were my rescuers. \"I don't remember how I got here.\" \n\nThe man looked at the woman. \n\n\"He's probably a spy for the Reich Navy.\" \n\nShe looked unconvinced. \"He's obviously not geared up to be a spy.\" \n\n\"Wait, Reich Navy? What are you talking about? Who are you guys? Where am I?\" \n\n\"Don't tell him, he'll just tell the Reich where we are.\" \n\n\"How can I be with something I don't know anything about?\" \n\n\"We need to take him back to the base for questioning.\" \n\n_____________________________________________ \n\nThe next thing I knew I was strapped to a chair. They didn't torture me, but they weren't letting me go, either. As I was in that room I had plenty of time to think, and things started coming back to me. The woman entered the room to question me. \n\n\"I'm sorry my brother knocked you out back there. He doesn't trust you. None of them do. But I do.\" \n\nHer brother was standing behind the glass window, glaring at me. \n\n\"My name is Aaron. I'm just a simple Jew from Poland.\" \n\nHer eyes grew wide and she quickly left the room. She was gone for a few minutes, and then she brought an elderly woman in. \n\n\"You are a Jew, you say?\" the old woman asked me. \n\n\"Yes, is that an issue?\" \n\n\"No one has seen a Jew in over fifty years. I thought they were extinct.\" \n\n\"Extinct? No, I'm from Warsaw, I was on the Titanic and-\" \n\n\"The Titanic?!\" The brother suddenly burst into the room. \n\n\"He's got to be full of shit. There's no way.\" \n\n\"I think he's telling the truth.\" His sister stated. Then she looked at me. \n\n\"So you don't know anything about the war? The last thing you remember is the Titanic?\" \n\n\"Yes we were on route to.... to.... I don't remember but we started to sink. I didn't get a lifeboat. Do you guys work for the American Government? Can you get me home?\" \n\n\"How long do you think you were in the iceberg?\" \n\n\"I don't know, a few days maybe?\" \n\n\"It's 2012, Aaron. I'm not sure you *have* a home anymore.\" \n\n\"2012, b.... wha...\" \n\n\"We need to contact Central about this.\" \n\n___________________________________________________________ \n\nINTRO \n\n\"My grandmother used to tell me about the old days, when the nations lived together in tenuous peace. \n\nThen everything changed when the Nazis attacked. \n\nOnly America, master of all four virtues, could stop them.

        "They are really here. Until the last moment I doubted that they would really find this place. So distant from civilization, it was supposed to be impossible for them to find us here. \n\nAll of my friends lie on the floor. My beloved Islam has a frozen look fixed on me. I blame myself, because of me he spent his last moments thinking of reasons for my hesitation. We agreed, everyone will swallow the pill one after another, no pause, for that will be too cruel for the last remaining. \n\nThey break the door. As soon as I see the first emotionless face of the damned things I am rendered unconscious. \n\nI awake in a white room. Looks like a hospital, though I can't be sure. It probably was a hospital once, but after these things took over, who knows what this building is used for. \n\nI hear someone coming. The memories flood my mind of the stories Ermek and Zhanna told us. How they experimented on them, played with their minds, took away their organs, all for the sake of developing weapons that will put an end for human species once and for all. \n\n\"You are awake. \"- said the synthetic ones- \"Please stay put, your meal will arrive shortly\" \n\nIt leaves the room. I am dub-folded, I awake in a cleanest room of my life, and they are going to serve me a meal. I conclude that the damned things probably don't even know how to treat someone improperly. \n\nA thought comes into my mind, \"why can't I escape alone, when Zhanibek was able to do that with Ermek on his back and Zhanna running behind them\". Then I remember in what physical condition he was, and how I compare. I give up the thought. \n\nShortly after it brought me my meal. There was no meat there, and the vegetables they used, if it were vegetables, were not the ones I recognized. They probably come from America or Europe, at the time of my earliest memory they already were already lost to mankind. \nIt is weird to eat something different after all this time. While the rations in the last village were quite diverse, they still got really repetitive after the first month.",
        "Mercury took the front lines. Swift, fearless, and the most experienced with his stolen Sunfire, he was always the first into battle. His astral form spun and looped through space wildly, weaving between the Flare Beasts as he cut them down. \n\n\"There's too many of them!\" \n\nCloud-wreathed Venus followed behind him to provide support. She lacked the aggression of Mercury, being similar to her brother Earth in some ways. But her blanket of clouds greedily absorbed every ounce of Sunfire that she could reach, and anything that entered that white haze never came out. \n\n\"I'll blockade them as long as I can. They're not going to hurt my brother!\" \n\nEarth hung back, eyes focused on the single shaft of light that shone through the black and red hordes, and bathed his home planet in its radiance. All the survivors had been placed in his care, for he was the origin of life. That ray of light was his lifeline, the only thing keeping a billion souls from freezing to death. \n\nIt was ironic that their only source of power came from their greatest enemy. Sol was supposed to be the leader of the Champions, providing energy to all the varied guardians of the planets. But he grew greedy and proud, thinking that he could use his power better than any of his fellow champions. Now his Flare Beasts blotted out the sun, an ever-expanding horde that devoured every scrap of Sunfire they could reach. \n\n\"This isn't working,\" Mars stated flatly. He had always been the calmest of the four inner planets. The planet he called home had been terraformed in the Great Expansion, but his power and nature still showed the dusty, icy rock that Mars had once been. \"There's too many of them.\" \n\n\"Hold on, Mars.\" Earth tried to keep the worry out of his voice. \"The outer planets are on the way.\" \n\nThe champion of the Red Planet called up a gust of wind, scattering a group of Beasts that had come too close to the beam of light, but they regrouped and charged again. \"They're too slow.\" \n\nMercury zoomed past them, two swords of white-hot stone carving into the horde. \"They take years to make an orbit. They're not going to get here in time!\" \n\nVenus swept her hands through the void, warding off the Beasts with waves of heat and sulfuric acid. \"I can't be everywhere at once! Mercury, I need you to...\" \n\nBefore she could finish the thought, a stream of insectoid Flare Beasts slipped past her. The last beam of light vanished. \n\nEarth felt a chill run through his bones as his home planet went dark. The temperature was falling fast. \n\n\"Earth! Are you okay? Earth!\"",
        "One morning Thomas walked into a coffee shop. There were two ladies chatting over croissants, a barista chewing gum, and a man in the corner on a laptop. Thomas ordered a latte because that is what one of the pretty ladies was drinking. When the latte was ready, he realized he had no money. \n\nHe approached the ladies and asked if they could lend him a few dollars in exchange for good conversation. They laughed and continued chatting. Thomas' head sank. He approached the man on the laptop. \n\nAs Thomas approached the man, he caught a glimpse of what the man was writing. \"It begins to rain,\" the man wrote on the laptop. To Thomas' astonishment, outside the coffee shop, it had begun to rain. \n\nThomas stopped. He looked at his latte sitting unpaid for on the counter. The barista was staring and tapped her fingernails. \n\nThomas lunged at the man and knocked him off his stool. Thomas' fingers danced across the keyboard. This is what he wrote: \"The man disappears. Nobody notices. The latte is paid for and is in my hand.\" \n\nThomas took a sip of the latte in his hand and looked around the coffee shop. There was the barista behind the counter and the two ladies chatting. Nowhere could Thomas spot the other man. He continued: \"The uglier of the two ladies disappears.\" \n\nThomas lifted his head. The pretty one had disappeared. Stupid computer. He hit control + z and the pretty lady returned. \"The pretty lady disappears,\" Thomas wrote sarcastically. \"And the barista. The ugly lady doesn't notice the disappearances and is suddenly interested in me.\" Thomas looked up and the pretty lady had taken a seat next to him, smiling. Thomas said hello. \n\n\"Hi yourself,\" she said. \n\nSeeing he needed some help, Thomas turned to the computer and wrote, \"She has a glass of wine. Also, a low cut top.\" Ohh la la. \n\nThe lady took a sip from her glass of red. \"You're a writer, huh?\" \n\nThomas sat back and smiled. \"That's right.\" \n\n\"Hubba hubba.\" She leaned forward. Oh boy. Thomas could see her cleavage. \n\nHe leaned forward for a kiss. She fell for him right then and there. Their kiss escalated quickly into a weird kind of wrestle. It was a truly great morning. \n\nBut as those new lovers fumbled, the pretty lady spilled her wine. Gosh.",
        "This hug has gone on too long. I need to pull away but she still has that \"friends forever\" firmness and she's not loosening. This is never going to work. I'm not going to write or call as much as I should, and honestly I won't want to. Break ups are supposed to be the end. That's why the word break is in it. It's a severance, it's final. If we were meant to be connected still it would be called a \"bend up\" or a \"twist up\" or something and I can't believe it but we are still hugging! \n\n.... \n\nPeople are starting to stare. I feel them staring. This coffee shop was a buzz with people going about their business and now I get the sense that they have all stopped to watch and count the minutes with me. Can they see my uncomfort. Shouldn't that guy on his computer be clacking away at the keys or the esspresso machine be hissing or an Adele song be on or something why is there no sound in this coffee shop!? \n\n.... \n\nYup. It's still happening. It's gone from the \"cross arm\" to the \"backpack strap.\" In my opinion a slightly more intimate hug type, and wildly inappropriate for this deep into a goodbye. This is baggage. This is what baggage is. I'm going to hang onto this feeling for the rest of my days. Every intimate moment I share with another woman, every embrace.... it will always feel like a double hug.... I'm cursed to experience double hugs forever now because she won't let go. This is it, Jesse, prepare yourself for crippling psychological immaturity, because you now suffer from stage five phantom ex-gf-hug syndrome. \n\n.... \n\nMaybe if I slip an arm free I could end this. I wish I knew Brazillian jiujitsu. God, how many times have I said that? I honestly feel that would solve most of my problems. I'd be so confident. She has to feel that I'm not hugging back. I've been limp for ages. If she eased back on the constriction for a second I would slide out and onto the floor like a noodle.",
        "The Wolf with the Scars \nThere was an lone wolf With scars upon it's face. It was a very cold night in Alaska, One night there was big storm a blizzard swept through Alaska. During the storm you could hear the many packs of wolves. Dringo Pack, which is pack of 10 wolves, were one of the smallest packs of wolves in the area. Their land runs from Howling Hills to Dead's Pit.This very small territory to own this area is known for not having a lot of animals to survive. Then the Wolf Pack Raptor, This pack is up to 15 Wolves with Alpha Male and Alpha Female running this pack for nearly 10 years.They are the second biggest and the fastest pack in all Alaska. Their territory is from end of Deep Pit to the tops of mountain Thrasher. The biggest Pack Dranko, has up to 25 wolves. They are the strongest pack. The Alpha Male and female been leading the pack for 5 years. The Beta Male Wolf Is a white wolf with a black ring with slash's coming out of black fur around his eye. He was the last remaining of past Alpha Male of the pack. His father and mother both died of old age which left the pack to the new Alpha Male and female. \nThe Pack Dranko, started to invade the Raptor Pack territory. The Raptor pack had sent two wolves to scan the invading pack to make sure they're not doing anything. As the Pack Dranko started to kill some elk and feed the pack, the Alpha male and female was eating, As the white beta wolf approaches the kill, the Alpha's started to growl and guard the kill. The white wolf thought it was game, so he reacted in a playing matter so he jump up to play. The Alpha male took this as a challenge so he attacked the white wolf biting his ear. As the white wolf felt his attack, he started to run. The Alpha male got to him, he attacked him biting his paw causing him to be injured. The Alpha Male Howls for Other pack and that start attacking him. As the Alpha Male swiped his paw at him causing three claw marks. One going from forehead down, one going from his eye down, and one going across his nose. White Wolf is now branded, with three scars of banishment from Pack Dranko. The white wolf fled from the Pack and the territory of Raptors as he ran for days.",
        "It was quiet in the apartment, just like every other night. My cat napped against my leg, sound asleep waiting for me to get up and get him a late night snack. Clicking through the last few pictures on the internet, I yawned and decided it must be bed time. Nudging the cat awake, I got up from the couch and headed to the bathroom to wash my face. \n\nThe water was cold as usual, but it would warm up right around the time I was done. Didn't matter, it was refreshing anyway. Drying my face on the yellow towel, I smiled my reflection in the mirror. She smiled back at me. \n\n\"Tomorrow is our big day,\" I told my reflection, watching as her mouth formed the words as well. \"First day of a new job. We'll finally get out of this hell hole.\" I put my hand on the mirror, her hand underneath mine. \"you'll do great, I promise.\" I turned off the light and stole one last glance at my reflection. \n\nIn the kitchen my cat was doing his usual'help me, I haven't been fed since this morning and am dying' routine of rubbing against my leg and meowing. He was a big kitty, but that was his charm. I mixed the little bit of wet food with the dry food, humming the theme song to a show I had been watching earlier. \n\nSuddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I jumped, spilling the bowl of cat food all over the counter and dropping the spoon. I lived alone, there should be no one else in my apartment. \n\n\"Hey, sorry to startle you,\" someone said from behind me. I could have sworn it was my own voice. Slowly, I turned around, only to come face to face with myself. She smiled at me, the same smile I had, the same one my reflection had. Terrified, I looked at the microwave, waiting to see my reflection in the stainless steel. There was nothing. \n\n\"how.... who...\" my words were jumbled as my mind tried to grasp what was going on. \n\n\"Oh, I'm from the mirror! I just wanted to wish you good luck tomorrow! You've always been so supportive of me I just wanted to share the sentiment.\" She giggled as if this was a perfectly normal thing to do. My cat meowed, weaving between the two of us, hoping one of us would feed him. \n\n\"Uh, thank you.\" I mumbled, not sure what to say really. She bent down, scratching my cat on the cheek, his favorite spot. \n\n\"Well, I better get back to reality. You really are the best reflection.",
        "These goddamn humans. Usually I can stand them, oohing and awwing at my (albeit sexy) wings and lovely singing voice, but there's been a new crowd for the past few weeks. Smelly ones, smellier than usual, and hairy, and instead of listening to me generously singing to them, they turn their backs and yell chants loudly at the other patrons of the zoo so nobody can even hear my gorgeous song. \n\nAnd today takes the cake. They clipped a nasty gash in my fence! It's twice the size of me- what if something gets in? They keep whistling to me and trying to get me to leave my home, but why should I? \n\nAnyway they booked it before my feeders came out, and I tried to show the dumb humans who work here that there was a big gash, but they didn't even notice! How rude. \n\nBut a few minutes ago, I finally heard her- a lady bird, just my type! She sounded like she could be interested. Now I'm kinda glad they cut a gash in my house. \n\nI fly out and only get a little scratch. I follow her voice. She's outside, but man it's cold outside. Maybe she'll agree to come back to the exhibit with me- there's lots of loose twigs for a nest if we want to do that. \n\nFirst I got ta see her. \n\nIf only these damn smelly humans weren't in my way. I think they have my lady bird, too!",
        "\"**E**ver since I was young, I've always despised the phrase \"Calm down!\" or \"Dude, chill!\" I'm a naturally calm person, you see, but being told to calm down really grinds my gears. Why am I telling you this? Well.... Here's the story. \n\nIt's April 10th, 2015, right? I'm minding my own business, walkin' to Starbucks, all that jazz, when this young fella on a bike nearly runs me over and spills my coffee all over me. I'm a tad distressed about this and I must have shown it in my face or my actions or something because the guy on the bike says \"Dude, just calm down!\" \n\nSomething inside me snapped. I reached for his neck, feeling the bloodlust within my veins. This would be the last time someone would tell me to calm down. He ducked away from my hands and yelled \"Dude, what's your problem? Just chill out and be calm!\" \n\n\"Listen, you nearly ran me over and made me spill my overpriced caffeine all over my shirt!\" I yell at him. I tear up when I'm angry, so he's all blurry when I say this. \n\n\"Look, man, I'm really sorry. I'll- I'll buy you another coffee, alright? Just leave me alone!\" The words had no effect on me. I was running on pure anger. My mind's higher functions shut down and all I could think was \"I have to kill this guy.\" That's all I remember. \n\nWhen I came to, a cop had me on the ground. \"What? What happened, officer?\" \n\n\"Mr. MahJong, you almost beat this guy to death.\" I looked around and gasped as I saw the guy who almost ran me over with his bike being loaded into an ambulance. His bike was bent and bloodied. *Did I beat him with my bike? * I thought to myself.",
        "The Fallen Angel slowly bats his eyes open, exhausted from the Great War. Not knowing where he had landed, he attempts to examine his surroundings. It is dark - a darkness that he had never known was possible, even in the darkest corners of the universe. As he recalls the events of the war, he slowly becomes enraged and filled with a deep hatred that inspires him to attempt to stand, although he can not see the ground beneath him. It is cold and textureless. \n\nA sound fills the void that strikes Lucifer to the core. It feels both distant and far, both loud and quiet, both low enough to vibrate his entire body and high-pitched enough to pierce his nerves. A horrible \"light\", if you could call it that, ignites a few feet away from him, emitting a painful burning sensation. He can see something in this aura of light. \n\nAlthough a face was not visible, Lucifer could see the outline of its body standing in the aura. Lucifer's eyes glare up at the creature staring down on him. It's skull is deformed, with horns piercing through its fleshy scalp. It had long, bony arms with lengthy claws for fingernails. It's legs were covered in fur, with hooves poking out of the ends of its legs. \n\nThe Angel's heart started beating faster and faster as his adrenaline slowly turns to fear. \"Who are you?\" Lucifer growls at the dark abomination, \"And what do you want with me?\" \n\nThe creature's face becomes visible as the light grows stronger and gets closer to the Fallen Angel, revealing a masculine face. His empty eyes pierce Lucifer's soul, whatever was left of it. His cheeks were sunken in, deformed frail but still terrifying. His lips peel back to reveal a truly morbid set of rotting teeth; if you could call them that. His forked tongue slithers through the pale-yellow gums as his mouth opens. \n\n\"I.... am you.... \n\n.... but stronger.\" \n\nThe creature suddenly whips on a pair of sunglasses, and the whole room illuminates. Lucifer closes his eyes as multicoloured bright lights flash around him. He carefully peers at this thing in front of him, confused and terrified. \"What is going on? Whats your name?\" \n\nThe man chuckles loudly at Lucifer's confusion. \"Deadass nigga, fuck you doin boi? Get that lil angel ass up, damn mang\" He grabs Lucifer's arm and helps him stand. \"Hey MTV, welcome to my crib, knowmsayn? Gotteem! Hahah.\" It slaps Lucifer on the back. \n\n\"Fr tho son, they call me Satan in this hood boi. Dont get it twisted or my crew fucc ya up aight?\" Satan takes a drink of something strong and laughs again, adjusting a crown of bones on his head. \"Goddamn nig this lean tite as fukc shiiiieeettt\" Lucifer stumbles back, incapable of comprehending this. He was in a flashing room with a floor that changed colour and a metallic ball hanging from the roof.",
        "Years before this, I kept a set of tungsten baoding balls on my desk. A gift from my wife when things were better, before our fights about money, misspent time and our dead bedroom. I'd kept them on display, occasionally glancing at them for an easy distraction from work, not quite appreciating their value. \n\nWhen things were rough at the office, I'd pull them out, grasping at the cold tungsten with my degrading fine motor skills, feeling my age creep up ever so quickly. Tungsten in hand, I could concentrate solely on the flexing and unflexing of my muscles, in a clumsy attempt to move my aging tendons. At first, it was easy to become distracted by the clutter of unfinished work, the ache in my neck, the hum of fluorescent lights, the whine from my computer and the noise pollution outside my half-hazardly drawn blinds. Over time, I found that I could ignore all that and focus my attention on those barely imperceptible metallic echoes. Leaning back in my chair, eyes closed, tungsten in hand I could find tranquility and with it a little bit of my disappearing sanity. \n\nA voice draws me from the void: \"Chief, we've got a report of three gobs over at McIllhenny park.\" \n\nI open my eyes, sitting up, while my hand continues it circular task. Slowly, the noise of the office comes back into my listening range, but for now it stays at the fringe of my hearing. \n\n\"Thanks for the notification, McCrillis, I'll choose today's squad.\" The officer's dull eyes, light up for a brief moment at my words and then return to their native dullness. \n\nDoors closed. Blinds drawn. I look around furtively, scanning for any opening. I see none and bring my hand over my desk and quickly open my palm. Tungsten dice clatter onto the metal desk. 2, 5, 6. \n\nI mutter aloud, speaking to nobody, \"Fortune's Favor\". Reaching down I pick up the first die, and quickly reroll it. 1. \n\nMy heart quickens. As I stand up, I can feel blood rushing to every corner of my body and a familiar warmth takes me. \n\nPicking up my badge and firearm. I open the door, as my voice cuts through the noise: \"McCrillis, Wall!",
        "The voice was a delightful one with a British accent. Alexander's voice stuttered as he tried to explain the situation going on now. \"Wh-who is this?\" He asked the mysterious voice. He knew that the only other phone was several rooms away, and was wondering if it was a joke. \"Now listen, something has gone very wrong. Time is folding into itself. I can't really explain it, but you are going to see things about society. Things you can't imagine and you are going to need help. I will be coming soon to help, but don't talk to anyone, don't eat anything, just don't look for anything. A man should be coming with a bow tie to help.

The truth of our headphones is that they are sentient creatures of wire and sound. These creatures have no felling or emotion but scientist have found them to have a thought process similar to a jelly fish. The creatures absorb our ideas and thought and store them in their memory. They also move when they are not disturbed by the presence of a living being, but cameras hidden from sight have proven to uncover their episodes of moving and tangling their cord. \n\nWeek 3 - In Use \nAfter the discovery of the interesting headphonoxads, we have engineered a way to direct their thought process to use useful information and store it long term in our memory.

        "Judy walked into the waiting room for her latest interview with a set of fresh green eyes and a radiant smile. \n\nThey called her name, she walked in and sat down in front of her Idol. \n\"So, you're Judy?\" \n\n\"Yes, Ma'am.\" \n\"Anything you wan na ask or talk about before we get started?\" \n\"Well, I was just wondering if you could per chance discuss what an average day here at Corruptio LLC would look like under your leadership?\" \n\"You want me to tell you what an average day as my disciple is like? Uhm, well how about I just tell you what today was like and we can go from there?\" Judy nodded, her green eyes lighting up from excitement. \n\n\"Well, I woke up to: \n\"Shit, shit, SHIT! WHERE ARE MY KEYS?\" I cringed as I got up and looked around at Andrea try to get her shit together. Petra was helping her get ready. I felt a sharp pain in my side, and picked up a set of keys that looked vaguely familiar. I handed them to Andrea adding on a quick goodbye while Andrea rushed off to make sure everything was ready for todays interviews. I checked my snapchat, and sighed when she saw 3 notifications, but none of them were from Donny. Donny was my goal, my fulfillment in life. To see him get his hopes and dreams shattered, well.... I would give anything to see it happen. Tammy didn't think it was right, but well, who cares what Tammy thinks? \n\nBut I could tell Donny would not be an easy one to shatter. Donny had spent his whole life building his confidence and his deep political and religious views. Laying down the perfect education, the perfect philosophy, and the perfect framework for the rest of his life and family. You see, Donny, was the perfect underdog story. He had nothing, raised in poverty and put in the hard work and determination to succeed in school, society, and sports. Got a full ride scholarship to attend Yale and well, of course he chose Duke instead to take care of his poor grandma instead. What a waste if you ask me. So much talent, so much potential. Yet he wastes it, trying to be \"Noble\" and all that other Fairy Tale crap. What. A. Joke. \n\nMy phone was ringing. I picked it up, thinking it might have been Andrea, forgetting her resume or something. I have to say, Andrea is amazing, but she is *way* too forgetful. The other day, she went out to frame someone for cheating, and she forgot to bring the *evidence* that she was going to plant! Stupid girl had to leave a voicemail instead, which we agreed earlier was much too boring. My heart stopped when I picked up the phone. I mean, granted, that's under the assumption I have a heart to begin with, but still. It was the one that I wake up every morning in hopes of seeing. It was Donny. \n\"Hey, I'm sorry I didn't get your text, I had to take my grandma to the ER.\" Ugh, I freaking hate when he does this. He always just shows off, how stupidly goody two shoes he is, and it is the most cringey thing ever. \n\"Uh, I only sent it like an hour ago?\"",
        "The shadows grew taller until they reached into my room, and the light of the world faded around me. I sat motionless in the dark, and a sorrowful breath escaped my lips. \n\nI fucked up again. \n\nI thought she would be different. Sure, I might have came across as a bit shy, but who doesn't? I caught her smiles so many times I couldn't even count, each one unique like a snowflake. She sent me winks, compliments and wishes - which I tried my best and more to try and fulfill them. \n\nBut I was wrong. \n\nMaybe I had read it wrong, or maybe she didn't know me - either way, I was once again banished to the realm of the forsaken friendzone, with nothing but a cold emptiness emanating from my heart. \n\nThe thunder flashed outside, startling me slightly. \n\n'Terrific.' I thought. \n\nIt seemed that even the weather was bringing me down. \n\nThere was another flash, but this time, I did not hear the thunder. Instead, I heard whispers that entered my ears like some slimy snake, leaving an unpleasant feeling in my mind. My teeth clenched as I realized I had heard this before, but I could not remember when. What was it? Was it during the 14th birthday? Was it during last Christmas? What was it? \n\nAs if to answer my question, something black and dusty exploded in front of me, causing me to be blown back into my bed. \n\nThe figure materialized steadily, and I could make out image through the silhouette. It was a woman, wearing a dark pointed hat, with hair black as a street cat's, with a robe that unified the colors. \n\nShe blinked, her blue, hollow eyes glowing in the dark, and then shifted her gaze on me. I had barely enough time to recover myself when she stormed in front of me and grabbed me by the shirt. \n\n\"You!\" She shrieked. An explosion of black smoke hissed out of her mouth as she spoke. \n\n\"W-what?\" I stammered. I raised my hands in a surrendering gesture, but it had little effect. \n\n\"We had a deal!\" \n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked. \n\nShe was then silent - but only for a split second. To my surprise, she released me, and clicked her fingers. In an instant, a piece of paper materialized in front of her. \n\n\"Four years ago. December the fifth. At the party.\" She stated. \n\nI carefully took the paper from her slim, bony hands, and looked over it cautiously. I was surprised to find that I could read the letters quite accurately, despite being in the dark. \n\nMy face changed to confusion when I realized what the paper had said. I was to promise her me firstborn, in exchange for musical talent.",
        "This is it. I close my eyes. \n\nOne more second.... \n\nI open my eyes, and find myself back at the top of the bridge. A chill runs up my spine. I must have fallen asleep for a moment. I'm dead tired. I lean forward once more, but the bridge swings upsidedown behind me. I'm hanging off by the bottoms of my feet, and the world is upside-down. \n\nI try to escape by jumping. It works at first, but after a mere second of falling, I land solidly on the bridge once more. The world it rightside-up. \n\nA chill runs up my spine. What the hell? I take a few steps to the side; the bridge is solid. I jump up and down violently; the metal clangs realistically. I look down; there are hundreds of cars driving on it. This is the Golden Gate Bridge, no question about it. The long fall calls warmly to my exhausted life. \n\nI shake my head to clear my thoughts, and jump once more. I'm going to kill myself for real, no matter how much I halucinate beforehand. But this time, the top of the bridge curves around and falls with me; the water recedes infinitely into the distance as I stare down to it; the top of the bridge has curled all the way down to its bottom! The rest of the world has faded to beneath my notice; without a point of reference, I couldn't tell that I had stopped falling. The doubled-over bridge, with cars still driving across it (!) into and out of the void on either side, is the only other thing in existence besides me. The bottom of the bridge swings towards me, and wraps around the top, spiraling it into the center. Finally it whips the top back around in ever-growing, ever-slowing loops, until it comes to a stop in the vertical position.",
        "PART 2 \n\nJeremy stood there in silence for a moment before opening his eyes. Through the glass he could see the luscious green of the jungle. He opened up the chamber and stepped out into the world. It was unlike anything he had experienced before. The technicolor bugs, the occasional glimpse of a monkey, the lack of machinery sounds. \n\nJeremy had been standing, mouth agape, for quite some time before he remembered to send the chamber back to the present. He dialed in the password, and the chamber slowly faded into the damp air. Jeremy checked his backpack before setting out to find his great grandfather. \n\nThe 42nd division had been stationed outside of Saigon for around a month, conducting reconnaissance among other activities. The issue for Jeremy would not be finding them, but rather avoiding the Vietcong on his way there. He looked at his compass, oriented himself due west and he was off. \n\nJeremy's forehead and armpits created swamps in the burning heat as his backpack wore him down. He had been careful to avoid being seen, and that had cost him. With every movement of leaves, Jeremy found himself on the ground in a hurry with a bruise to show for it.",
        "Until recently, one word could have summed up my life pretty well: \"typical\". \n\nI took the same route as most of the kids from my neighborhood. After graduating high school, it was off to an in-state university to pick up my major in Awesome Studies. It was easy to follow the pack. In a way, it felt like I was doing the right thing, too. Who could argue with doing what my whole family expected of me? An Awesome degree would open plenty of doors that would take me into a comfortable life. \n\nBut even after I graduated, I couldn't get an old college buddy off of my mind. We hadn't spoken in years, but I couldn't stop thinking about something he'd told me. I still think about it. \n\nVince was an unassuming kid. Quiet, studied hard, and if you saw him pass by in the hallway, if you even noticed him, you'd probably think, \"There goes another Formula 1 driver.\" \n\nBut Vince was full of surprises. I was friends with his roommate at first, and didn't much care about this quiet, dorky kid who was always reading in the corner when I was over there drinking or smoking. But when I got talking to him, and he told me that he was an engineering major, it got my attention. \n\nWant to hear a joke? What does the Engineering major say to the Ninjitsu major? \"Do you want fries with that?\" \n\nWell, Vince had heard it a hundred times, but he was still doing it. How was he still doing it? How could he have the courage? I'd wanted to be an Engineer once, too. But I figured that one day, you have to let your childhood dreams go, and face the fact that in all likelihood, you're going to spend your adulthood flying through space. \n\nVince and I got talking, and I realized that I *liked* talking to him. He was a good listener. He had a good soul. And one day, I asked him. \"How can you stick with Engineering like this? Aren't you afraid it won't work out?\" \n\nHe gave me a small smile. \"I'm more afraid of spending the rest of my life wondering if it *would* have worked out.\" \n\nAnd those are the words that stuck with me all those years. Even when I took the path that my mother and father expected of me. When I became what they wanted me to be. \n\nI was the Night. \n\nThere were plenty of Batmans in my family, and they were all proud of me when I took up the \"family business\". I can't deny, either, that there was a pleasure in a hard day's work.",
        "\"That him?\" I said, peering through the two way mirror into the interrogation room. \"Doesn't look like much.\" \n\nThe man next to me fidgeted nervously. \"That's him. 37 years old, single, travels during his vacations. Teaches.... well teached, after today, 3rd grade at the Assets school. Did you get the file?\" \n\n\n\"Read it on the plane ride. You really fucked the chicken on this one.\" I stated bluntly. \n\n\nHe sighed, resigned. \"I'm still under the impression this guy knows more than what he lets on. This is too big of a coincidence. Especially his survival. His excuse is..\" \n\n\"I'll talk to him. Hows containment?\" \n\n\"Ongoing. The Asset self-terminated upon arrival with local law enforcement as scheduled. At that time I took command of the intitial response unit and grabbed that fat asshole in there out of Room 207. Barely managed to sanitize the room without the rest of the guys getting involved. Had to fake a nervous breakdown and send for the medics, luckily no one else wanted to stay in that particular room any longer than necessary.\" He swallowed. I sympathized. \"I thought the whole thi-\" \n\n\"Markinson, write your opinions in your report, please. In the meantime, I need to know if any actual-factual information is going to spring up.\" My temples ached. The entire scenario had gone almost exactly according to plan, only a good 8 years too early and with too many witnesses. I had flown in on a Shop LearJet loaded with analysts and field advisors, which was already drawing a small crowd of aviation aficionados at the local strip. The teacher had survived and it had only been pure luck that our plant in the local PD had managed to land a spot on the SWAT team the previous year out of pure aptitude rather than string pulling. There was literally zero contingency plans that had taken this type of occurrence into account. \n\nThe frumpy little man in the interrogation room shifted nervously. \"Did that fucker just fart?\" Markinson asked. \n\n\"I think the blood is sticking to his pants. You got the box?\" He nodded. \"Hand it over.",
        "Master Wayne, you and Dr Thompkins have discussed this already. This dream, these fantasies you're having, they are a product of grief. I know it has been quite some time since your last session with her, Master Wa -- \n\nYes, I suppose she did say it would be good to find some outlet for your pain but I hardly think vigilantism is what she had in mind. No boy should have to bear the burden forced upon you, I understand that sir, but you are still young. I know from your tutors you've excelled in every course you have taken at school, no doubt you are clearly quite exceptional. No I'm not trying to flatter you Master Wayne, merely show that I understand where you are. \n\nYou are highly intelligent Master Wayne. Thomas, your father, always saw that in you. He never told you, worried it might get to your head, but he would always tell your mother what high aspirations he had for his little genius. It's simple genetics really, both of your parents were some of the finest minds in Gotham. It was my distinct pleasure to be at their service and evidently they raised a very intelligent young man. A caring one at that. You have the heart of your mother. \n\nBut the world is bigger than myself or even you can fathom in its entirety Master Wayne. I used to help your father with the Wayne Foundation work, did you know that? Your father spent hours trying to help those at the bottom of our society. And even your father, with his brilliance, his resources and his unwavering spirit struggled to find the light in the darkness. This city is steeped with evil Master Wayne, and I am so sorry you had to experience that. But even your father knew that it would take more than one man to rid Gotham of its corruption. Of the darkness. \n\nI'm not sidetracking.... yes I know you've heard it all before Master Wayne but you must see. Dr Thompkins has made it quite clear that this guilt, your guilt, is going to remain for quite some time. You must see that in no way could you have stopped what happened from happening. Sometimes the wind blows so hard we can not even take the first step against it.",
        "*Crrack! * the blow came out of nowhere, breaking Harold's nose and and knocking him to the ground. As he rolled on the floor clutching his face, he managed to force out a \"what was *that*?!?\" between the various profanities issuing from his mouth. \nA kick to the gut silenced him, if only for forcing the air out of his lungs. \n\"Shut it kid. You don't know how much you deserved that.\" The owner of the boot growled at Harold. Harold attempted to apologise to the boot, managing a quiet whimper. The boot retreated, and Harold sat up. This wasn't supposed to happen. He had come to the park to meet his Guardian Angel. Random violence was not on the cards. \nHe looked around and found the boot owner sitting on the bench. Towering over Harold, the man clenched and unclenched his knarled fists, a sly grin on his face. His muscles bulged in an ill fitting suit, the tie pulled loose to allow the shirt to fit around the behemoth's neck. \nThe boot owner looked at Harold, causing him to flinch. \n\"Well kid, what do you want to ask?\" \nHarold stared, horrified. \n\"You're my Guardian Angel? *You*?\" The man snarled, and wings spread behind him. Dirty wings, wings that looked like they'd been through a hurricane, but wings nonetheless. \n\"Of course I'm your angel. You think anyone else would take the job?\" The angel shuffled along the bench. \"Come'ere kid.\" He reached out his hand and grabbed Harold's nose. \n\"Nonononono...\" *Crrack* \"Aargh!\" Harold screamed as the Angel's mouth flicked a smirk. \n\"There, kid. Good as new.\" Harold rubbed his nose.",
        "You wake up. \n\nEverything is so clear now, you wonder how the hell it wasn't before. Thousands of life lessons learned, experiences ranging from extreme poverty to abundant wealth, lives lived in plush comfort and in abject terror. All the memories across a million different landscapes come flooding in. The time you eked survival out of a desert. Swimming in the icy waters of a fjord. Running your hand across a wave of golden grain. Standing on the moon and looking back at the pale blue dot that was Earth. You are all of them at the same time, every emotion, want, fear, lust, greed, joy, tear, happiness, all as one. You laugh and laugh, thrilled at having lived so much. \n\nYour time of rest is now at an end; death is a part of the cycle as is life.",
        "\"Yeah I know you can read minds,\" the voice scowled. \n\n*What? * I thought. \n\n\"Sitting there cocky and all. Thoughts are meant to be private, you know? That's why they're called *thoughts*,\" the voice enunciated the last word. \n\nIt was a feminine voice for sure. The park was crowded. Much too crowded to identify the one girl talking back. Thinking back? I lowered my noise-cancelling headphones and listened for anyone actually talking to me. Nothing. Just kids laughing and parents yelling after them. \n\nI re-raised the headphones back into place. The headphones weren't necessary for me to read minds, but it allowed me to distinguish them easier. No external noise penetrated them. It gave me tight control of my ability. \n\nI gave a final visual scan of my surroundings. No one stuck out. Hmm, interesting. \n\nEver since I was little I thought I was unique. I knew I was unique in reading minds, absolutely. From finding out where my parents hid my presents to getting answers from professors I was always a step ahead of the curve. Most of the time thoughts were so boring, though. Everybody was the same. Insecurities, ideas of what to eat, and money - I'd heard it all - hundreds of times over. \n\nJust across the pasture a cute girl gazed in my direction. She smiled. *Ooh*. I had to see what that meant. I'turned' on my ability. \n\n\"Oh my god. He's so cute! Those headphones are too big for his head - what a dork. But SO cute.... Now he's looking at me. What do I do?\" \n\n*She's really into me, * I thought. I smiled at her. She smiled back. I gathered my things and made my way over to her. \n\n\"Here he comes. He's actually coming over to talk to me!\" \n\n*Wow! I am nailing this. * \n\n\"How's my hair look?\" She adjusted her hair nervously. \n\n*I love when girls do that. * \n\n\"Oh my gosh. He smiled again. So cocky! I loved that.\" \n\nI had approached her. She was sitting. Her back resting on the tree. I extended out my hand. \n\n\"Hi. My names --,\" \n\n* -- Jonah, * Her thought cut me off, but her voice sounded different. It was that same feminine voice as before. \n\n\"You?\" I asked, confused on so many levels. \n\n*Yep! * She answered. \n\n\"You can read minds too?\"",
        "Nat King Cole wiped an errant strand of hair from the shoreline of his adamant gaze. \n\n\n\"Francis, it's the only way. We're really gon na get necked if we refuse the truth here.\" \n\n\nA blur came running straight at them. \n\n\nIt headbutted Frank in the face, and sent him reeling. \n\n\nSpinning with an effortless vigor, it twirled into a 1090\u00b0 spinning scissor kick, catching King Cole in the solar plexus and Frank in the clavicle with the heels of two spurred boots. The shadow gracefully perched as it landed on the toes of its left foot, the right still held in a ready-to-strike stance. \n\n\n\"How'd you boys like that jingle? It's been a' JANGLIN' in my head for some time now!\" \n\n\nHarry Babbitt flashed a cheeky smile. \"I'M taking over. You cats can have all the leftovers, after I DOMINATE ALL THE LABELS!!!!\" \n\n\nSinatra gritted his teeth. Aside from the blood dripping down his face from that last roundhouse, he wasn't feeling quite ready to roll over. \n\n\n\"EARRINGS WERE MEANT FOR WOMEN, NAT! I'LL NEVER GIVE THOSE POTARA A SECOND LOOK!\" \n\n\nNat sang a line from Unforgettable as he bounded off of an alley wall and smashed into Babbitt's neck with an rolling axe kick. Freezing him in place with his Lyrica Strike, he voiced the invoking line, \"That's how you'll stay!\" \n\n\n\"Good golly Miss Molly, I....I can feel him devouring the charts,\" Sinatra growled. \"Columbia..... Capital's.... Geh! They're.... BEING DEVOURED, Nat!\" \n\n\nFrank was finally feeling the gravity of this situation. After the release of Forest Rangers, Ky Kaiser began to focus on giving Babbitt more radio time, more singles, hoping to use his musical talent to reunite the world. \n\n\nBut Kaiser's judgement was flawed. Babbitt had different plans for Earth. \n\n\nHe let out a demonic falsetto, shattering Nat and Frank's Defenser Phones. \n\n\n\"AS SOON AS I CAN MOVE, I'M TAKING YOU YUTZES ON A SLOW BOAT TO CHINA!\" \n\n\nThe Communism was strong with this one. And even the combined forces of Nat King Cole and Frank Albert Sinatra were hard pressed at showing him the door. \n\n\nFrank gazed down. Tightening his fist, he held out his right hand to Cole. He opened his hand. \n\n\nNat shot a look of confused, yet amiable surprise at Sinatra. Brushing back a lock of hair, he jested.",
        "It had been months since I'd last seen another human being. Things were getting colder now, the lack of movement and body heat on the earth, coupled with the sudden abundance of plants would do that, I suppose. It was strange, despite the world as we know it having ended, some parts of the internet still functioned. I still played Pokemon Go from time to time as I travelled into the ruins of the larger cities. The Pokestops were often restaurants, so they would help me find some food to eat. As I set up camp for a night, I plugged my mobile phone into its solar battery pack and opened up the application. \n\nSomething was off, one of the pokestops was different, outlined by a pink border and spouting flower petals. There was a *lure. * I grabbed my bags and ran towards the stop, knowing I only had a short while before the lure would disappear. It took me a good twenty minutes to come within range of the stop. \n\nI tapped on the icon to see who could possibly have placed this lure, elated at the prospect of seeing another person for the first time in ages.",
        "*Night Terror* John, initially agitated by a loud thumping sound waking him up, rubbed his eyes as he turned around and scanned the floor for his friend Luke. Highlighted by the moonlight was the empty pizza carton left between his bed and the air mattress Luke was sleeping on. His sleep-drunken gaze remained on it for a few seconds.... Until he heard Luke faintly whisper \"Help me...\" The wavering in his voice, trembling even, immediately alarmed John, who sat up in his bed. Tears reflected the moonlight off of Luke's cheeks. \"Luke? You okay, man?\" John naturally assumed that Luke was having a nightmare. He often said that he dreamt weird and scary shit after their \"binge gaming nights\". \"John? He-....... Help me. ``, he sniveled. As John peeled his eyes to make out what was going on, he was able to smell urin. \"Jesus, Luke, the fu-!? ``, John exclaimed, so very disgusted, but was interrupted by the faintest sound of a growl, made from *above* Jake. John's arm shot towards the lamp and boy, he wished he hadn't turned it on. The room lit up, revealing what looked like a misshapen child sitting bent over on Luke's chest.",
        "\"A *pumpkin*!? You turned her into a PUMPKIN!?\" I swerved, narrowly missing an oncoming car. \n\n\"Oh ya, no biggie.\" Mort's voice from the other side of the line was nonchalant, even bored. \"You know how I am with my plant magic. Got a real green thumb, ye? Besides, she was being a bit of a nag, and pumpkins don't have mouths.... amiright?\" \n\nIt was all I could do to not hang up on him right then and there. \"Mort.... I told you, use magic one more time in my house, and I would have your head.\" \n\n\"Yeh, yeh, no need to be such a buzzkill, mate.\" He said dismissively. \"But, mate. Did you even hear the rest of what I said?\" \n\nI grit my teeth. \"No, Mort. I am not going to pick you up a fifth. Hell, I am not going to pick *anything* from the store for you, *until you set her right*!\" \n\n\"Alright, alright, geeze.\" Mort sounded exasperated. \"I'll get her back to normal in a jif. Don't get your panties in a wad. Gon na need that fifth though,'s an integral part of the spell.\" \n\n\"Uh huh. And I'm the queen of England.\" My grip on my phone was so tight it was painful. \n\n\"Well, hey, if you don't *want* me to change her back.... Halloween is coming up pretty soon, mate.\" He laughed like a hyena right into the receiver, forcing me to hold my phone away from my head. \"Naw, just playing mate. I'll set her straight. But don't forget the fifth!\" \n\nHe hung up the line, leaving me to stew in my own thoughts. \"Alright.",

        "Everyone has scars, there's no denying it and if someone does they're just going to get another scar. The scars we get from telling lies don't hurt us physically, hell, we can hardly even feel them. Some scars are deep, some are hardly noticeable, but they are still there and there's no such thing as a scarless body. The only person that I have met who came close only had one scar, but it was the worst scar I have ever seen. His name is Harold and when I met him all I could see of his scar was the part that went over his eye and down his face and neck into his shirt. It wasn't until we got to know each other better that he showed me it's true extent. A scar that continued down past his heart and wrapped all the way to his back. \n\nI met Harold at a bar a few years after I graduated college, we talked over drinks and found we had a lot in common. Harold was ten years older than me, but we both had a son that was in grade school, they even went to the same school. We met more frequently at the bar and eventually started to spend time together outside of the bar. As the time passed our friendship grew stronger, we did so much together with our children that most people thought that we were related. Our children became best friends as they grew up. We were both single fathers. I had my son with a girlfriend from college who dropped him off with me one day and never came back. Harold's wife left him when his son was only a few years old. \n\nI've never been one to hide my scars. I talk about most of my scars when the topic comes up, but there are some that only Harold knows the reasoning behind. Harold never talked about his scar and that was fine, I knew when the time was right he would. I never asked because it isn't polite to ask someone about their scars. I tied to not talk about scars around Harold because I knew it made him uncomfortable considering the size of his. The only thing that I know about Harold's scar is that he didn't get it all that long ago. \n\nI asked Harold how he could go his whole life only telling one lie and he would always say he didn't ever feel the need to lie. Even if we didn't get scars with every lie, I don't think that Harold would be able to lie.",

        "I know something is different. It's not just the change in smells, or the looks on their faces, it's me too. I'm so tired, like I have been for a long time. They never seemed to mind, they'd pet me and tell me I'm a good dog - and everything was okay. \n\nEverything is okay. \n\nIt's not so bad when I realize what's different. I don't remember to well how I got her but I know this one human in his strange white thing is the needle man - but he's always been nice, too. I've been seeing him a lot lately. \n\n.... \n\nSlipped into sleep again for a few minutes there. \n\nNow everyone is here. All of the humans, all of my friends. I'm so glad to see them all, because soon I'm going to have to go to sleep for a long, long time and if I don't see them how will they know I love them? \n\nIt's so hard, but I wag my tail. I try not to look to tired. I even try to stand up, but I don't do so well and the needle man moves in and rests a hand on my side. He makes comforting noises, I guess to tell me to not try to stand, and that's okay. \n\nOne by one my humans come to me. They pet me. They give me things, little treats and big hugs. All of them smell familiar and all of them smile in a new way that is sad but still full of love. I lick them, let them know I love them so much. My tail keeps wagging, but it's slow. It's not so bad. \n\nI don't let them see how much I'm hurting, though. I've done my best not to show them that. They're my friends, I shouldn't make them sad or worried. \n\nThere's a human who is like my mother. She's taken care of me since I was a puppy. She fed me with a strange plastic thing full of milk and held me when the sky was angry and exploding and when other humans made light and booms in the sky. It's been so long. \n\nI try to lick at her face and tell her I'm sorry that I'm so tired. I don't want to go and leave her alone. I love her a little more than all the others, so much that the hurting seems little in comparison to the thought of leaving her. \n\nBut she's not mad at me. She hugs me and cries and tells me soft things that I think mean that it's okay, and I've earned my sleep. I was a good dog. I know those words. She's telling me I was a good dog, I am a good dog. I wish I could make their sounds but I don't know how. When I lick her face again, it's to say thank you. \n\nThe needleman comes and my human holds me gently, whispers softly.",
        "\"It's tough business being the only good merchant between the free cities, and the mountains to the East. Adventurers come in either going to go dungeoneering, pioneering, or just plain exploring and are always requesting top-notch gear that can't really be supplied that often. Mostly because caravans rarely come out this far so most of my stock comes from returning adventurers. There was one time that this guy sells me an amazing, never dulling, MAGIC SWORD just mumbling something about'low dps, weak cleave dmg...' but I had to buy the damn thing because I knew it could turn a profit and...\" I babbled on. \n\n\"Dude, I just need some harness rope, some spare arrows, and a better bomb bag.

She cooed over me saying I was her'hero' but I knew she didn't mean it. I saw the way she swooned over every'Conan' or'Hercules' that wandered into my shop. Maybe I was just bitter. Maybe I had a right to be mad. Maybe I should stop talking to myself. \n\n-- -- - \n\nThe week trudged on until one day, a messenger bearing a royal decree appeared with a new doctrine. It read, \"Due to the swell in adventuring tourists, and potential market boom this could bring as valuables are brought from ruins: All shopkeepers MUST purchase anything made of precious metal that is determined to come from the mountains.\" \n\n\"This is horrible,\" I said to the messenger, \"there is no way I want to buy thirty pots, pans, plates, and a couple rusty swords from some copy and paste, silent adventurer just because he shares'dragon blood' or something. I am already abused enough as a shop keep, why do I have to purchase all of these artifacts and ruins that I could never possibly sell! Plus, half of my valuable merchandise gets stolen by sneaktheives and sweet role stealers. So No! I refuse! I will travel to the king's castle, bang down his door, and demand that this law be removed.

        "Being reborn as a tree was frustrating. Being reborn in her backyard made it worse. \n\nCommitting suicide wasn't an easy decision, but I couldn't bear living without her. Knowing I'd never be with her again removed the element of fantasy and hope from my life. When I saw she'd cheated, when she told me she didn't love me anymore, ever, I felt my heart sink. The floor I'd been standing on for years collapsed beneath me. Committing suicide wasn't a decision at all, it was the only available option. \n\nI don't know how long it took, but here I am. Could have been five years, may have been twenty. It took me a while to sense that I was alive, even longer to sense the people around me. But when she pulled my first apple off and laughed of excitement, I could feel the vibrations. She woke me up. \n\nShe's moved on. I can't tell who he is, but I can feel children, I can feel happiness, I can feel warmth. I wonder if she misses me but there are no signs that she does. I ache for the days she comes to pick apples. I've been training to drop leaves and fruit on my own accord, waiting for the day she'll just venture to sit under my shade with a book. Somehow hoping that she'll understand the sign. But she never does; the modern life surrounds her, no time for sitting under trees. \n\nI've come to terms with my fate. I want it all to end again.",

She would have to paint her future. She saw Peter, her childhood friend, and then Eric, her companion during the struggle. \n\n\"Please.... Emilia...\" Peter stared at her with eyes the color of the ocean. \n\nThe heroine tugged at her braided hair and screamed. \"YOU ARE LITERALLY FORCING ME INTO A POSITION WHERE ROMANCE IS THE ISSUE WHEN MY FAMILY IS PROBABLY BEING CRUSHED UNDER OUR HOUSE. BYE.\" \n\nSo both love interests fell to the ground and Emilia rushed to save her relatives.",
        "\"Are you buying that or what?\" my wife said with a strange, emotionless face as she looked straight ahead. \n\nWe both stood there with the front door pulled open as far as the chain let it go.

        "I actually didn't see it at first. We always had some wear marks on out skin: laugh lines, crows feet, imperfections that told stories of our happiness. \n\nOne day I noticed a slight sag to her skin. Not that I cared of course, she was my love and it didn't matter what she looked like to me. But I was worried. \n\nA month after that I came home to find her collapsed on our bathroom floor sobbing, he hands full of grey hair. She had been trying to hide it from me for the last year so I wouldn't worry about her. \n\nI held her as close as I could that night. \n\nThree months later she was in a hospital. We both knew it wouldn't do any good, but it felt good to pretend. She had aged so much in a year and a half that I'm sure I looked like a favored grandchild comforting the family matriarch in her passing days, and we didn't correct anyone in order to protect our secret. \n\nShe was dying. It mad no sense to pretend otherwise, at least to myself. For her I never let on that I might be worried about her end. I tried to tell myself that it was bound to happen eventually. We've both seen friends innumerable grow and pass before us. When you're immortal, death is as familiar to you as breathing. \n\nThis kind of death was something I haven't known for a very long time. \n\nI would be alone. \n\nI would be the last immortal to walk this earth. \n\nI chose to reject the thought when it would creep back into my waking world; but in my dreams I was always alone calling out into the darkness for her.",

        "I'd been given the papers, all the documents; everything seemed in order. I'd never met the client myself\u2014my assistant typically does all of that work. I simply hear what they want from my assistant, and from what they, the client, has written on the paper. \n\nWhat? TV isn't going to watch itself. \n\nSpeaking of which, earlier that week, I was watching TV while my assistant handled some legal paperwork for some lawsuit or some something or other\u2014but that's not the point. I was watching the local news to discover which bakeries were having better sales when, when a news alert popped up. * \u201c Ski-masked criminal robs bank, $ 1 million stolen \u201d * it read, followed by a security camera feed that showed a man dressed in all black, wearing a ski mask, darting through the bank's lobby and out to a getaway car across the street. \n\nNeedless to say, I was shocked. A robbery, in our town? That's insane, seeing as we have one of the best police forces in these parts. But I digress. \n\nBack to the present: I was preparing all of my tools for the upcoming surgery, when I finally met the client for a last minute sit-down to make sure everything went well. I absolutely can not describe my shock. There, before me, in my own surgery room no less, stood that ski-masked criminal, clad in nondescript black clothing and a black ski mask. I was so stunned I nearly dropped my coffee. \n\nWhat? Coffee isn't going to drink itself. \n\nAnyway, I was nearly speechless. But when he showed me a hefty wad of cash, well, I couldn't resist. I believe the first words out of my mouth were, \u201c Well, alright then. Your nose isn't going to grow itself. \u201d \n\nAnd so we did. I had him lay down on my table, my assistant by my side, and we began to get to work. It was a little tough, I recall, working with a ski mask. The lips in particular were hard to get right thanks to the small hole\u2014cotton is a real pain to stitch a nose onto too, I might add\u2014but I got it done in one fell swoop, and it looked pretty good too. Kind of like someone took a sock puppet and pasted human facial pieces onto it. \n\nBut professionally. Because I am a professional. \n\nThe rest is history. A job well done, a face remade. \n\nSo, now to the real issue. These handcuffs aren't going to remove themselves.",

        "'What is this feeling?', I asked myself. \nI had been feeling this since the morning, this feeling of terror, a feeling which turned out to be a premonition. \nI suddenly felt that I was falling down, but caught myself in mid-air. \nMike chuckled and told me to tie my shoelaces. \nI returned to reality and saw that my shoes had indeed come untied. \n\nI did just what he said. As I bent down, that feeling returned. I decided to shrug it off. As I did, Mike continued walking. I looked up and saw two things at once. One, he had created a five foot gap between us, and two, a man coming out from a side alley, grabbing a silenced pistol from his jacket, grabbing Mike and pulling him into said alley, and shooting him. \n\nAt that moment, I froze. I was still bent, only my face was up and I had just become witness to the assassination of one my co-workers and friends. I didn't know how to react, but I knew had to stay calm because I had just been walking with Mike. I was quite certain that if I stepped any further, the man would see me. I again bowed my head and pretended to tie my shoe. Okay, Mike is dead. You just saw it, and you can't do much about it. Two shots to the chest would probably kill anyone, and by the way the assassin had grabbed Mike, it was quite possible that Mike was in that dumpster that I knew was in that alley. \n\n'I thought you said there would be two.', I heard the man say. \nA tremor went down my spine when I heard the next sentence,'Tying his shoelaces?' \nOh, crap.",
        "I sat waiting at the bus stop as I did every day and sitting across the street same as all the other days, he sat. An older man, bearded and wearing the same dirty layers he wore the first time I'd seen him nearly a month ago. \n\nMost days I'd roll my eyes at the sight of him, rattling that cup of money around, begging. *Why don't you just get a job? * I'd think at him. *There are shelters if you're desperate, you're just not willing to try. * \n\nOccasionally I would wonder what his story was, wonder if I was judging him too quickly but before I could give it much thought, my bus would arrive and I'd be on my way to classes for the day. \n\nToday, something happened. \n\nA group of guys walk over to him and start taunting him, calling him names. I can see my bus coming a few streets away, and am glad that I'll be out of here soon. I try to avoid looking in the direction of the action, but inevitably I end up looking back to watch. Humans are so weird the way we can't seem to look away from a train wreck situation. \n\nJust as my bus is pulling up to the stop in front of me, I watch the thugs snatch away the cup of change from the homeless man's hand and kick him square in the face. I jump, hand flying to my mouth as the bus blocks my view. Without thinking, I jump to my feet and run right around the bus and, carefully checking for oncoming traffic, cross the street. \n\nLaying on his side is the man, holding his bleeding face while the men hurry away from him, laughing. I take out a handkerchief from my pocket and offer it to him. Graciously he takes it from my hands, dabbing at his nose and behind us the bus drives off. If I make it to class today, I'll be very late. \n\nAs my attention gives itself fully to the man, I hear myself saying \"I'm so sorry.\" Thought I'm not really sure why I'm apologizing. He doesn't respond, a look of defeat in his eyes. \"Can I take you to get something to eat?\" I offer. He doesn't give me much of an answer, but I decide that if he doesn't refuse I'll take him. I help pull him to his feet and walk at a slow pace with him to the mcdonalds a few blocks ahead. \n\nI sit down with him in a booth for a moment, he's still wearing that same look of defeat. I want to encourage him somehow but I find myself at a loss for words. I've never been in his shoes, in fact I don't even know *what* his story really is. Before I can even think it over, those are the next words finding their way out of my mouth. \n\n\"What's your story?\" He looks up at me and as our eyes meet I can see a life behind his. A long and hard life.",
        "The man in the hoodie could barely stop snickering. I couldn't see his face, but that was normal for most clients meeting in the flesh. We were sitting at the diner at Fourth and Union, just like he requested. \n\nWith gloved hands, he slid a small envelope forward. \n\n\"The mark?\" \n\nHe nodded, still holding back laughs. He was doing that pulsating jigger people do when they're laughing hard but not breathing, or when they want to laugh really hard but refuse to allow themselves the air to do it. Whatever. The money was most important. \n\nI opened the envelope and saw a picture of myself. I looked up at the man. \n\n\"Is this a fucking joke?\" \n\nThe man took off his hoodie and what was underneath was too horrifying to describe. \n\n***\" SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER!! \"*** \n\nI died instantly.

Stop a rape, or a murder. Fall back into my regular life. Seemed like a dream. Until I found out what exactly happened to me while I stopped time. I aged along with it. It wasn't noticeable to me for the first few years, as I never stopped time for too long. Scared something would happen. But when I turned 40, my doctor pulled me aside.

        "Before I start this story, I would just like to say I don't mean any cats any harm. I really don't - I mean, come on, I'm practically one of them. Some people even call me catty. Even if I don't quite get catcalls. \n\nYes, I *am* a guy. \n\nMy name is Jaymes - yes, my parents chose to spell it with a \"y\", because well, \"y\" not? Eh, eh? No? \n\nOkay, anyway. This story begins on an ordinary Tuesday night, just like this one. All week, I had been noticing the stray cats snooping around, moving quite a bit both in the day and at night. Something was brewing - I just assumed it was some sort of cat-turf war or a great Wild Cat Hunt for some rats. So, I decided to follow one particular cat I had fed once or twice. \n\nThe cat had fur that was a brownish hue, like the sort you'd find on wood or chocolate. The sort that seemed just too beautiful for nature to produce. Though that might have just been the dirt. I stalked - or, well, tried to stalk - closely behind it, ducking left and right behind walls like I had seen people do in all the shows and games. And every time I did this, I thought to myself with an imaginary fist pump, \"Juked!\" \n\nIt probably noticed me but continued onward anyway. Slowly, towards an abandoned parking lot, which was barely used even in its heyday, but now laid in a state of discard and disrepair. A few trees had somehow taken root in the worn out cracks of the old cement and concrete surface, brute forcing their way out of the black asphalt in a startlingly violent manner.",
        "\"Good Morning, Diane.\" The voice was friendly, never annoyed. It came from the ceiling and said those words every morning at six-thirty. \n\n\"Good Morning, DAD.\" Diane stretched in bed, yawned and rubbed her eyes. She flipped the covers off and sat up, scratching her scalp. \n\n\"Are you ready for your big day?\" DAD (Digital Adult Diagnostics) asked with the same voice. Always the same voice. Diane had not known about inflection until she was seven and was finally shown video from the outside world. Until then, she had also talked with a flat, even voice. Not so much now. She had learned to color her intonation to fit the moment. Thank you \"Small Wonder\" reruns. \n\n\"Sure. Big day. I'll be ready in a few. I've just got to get cleaned up. Give me a minute, please.\" \n\n\"Of course, Diane. Come out to the dining area when you are ready.\" \n\n\"I'll be there in a few.\" Diane entered the bathroom and did the usual: brushed her teeth, emptied her bladder. She knew that she was not really alone. DAD was watching. Analyzing. If the chemistry of her urine was off, DAD would know. If she did not brush for at least two minutes, DAD would know. Diane had long ago learned that she must do these things or there would be consequences. DAD insisted that these things were needed to keep Diane healthy; that DAD was not hectoring Diane without reason. So be it. Diane had also learned to pick her battles with the computer. \n\nAfter getting dressed, Diane went down to the dining room and had breakfast. Today was a good day: he got scrambled eggs and bacon with his orange juice. Diane knew that it was all laced with vitamins and minerals and other assorted chemicals to help keep her healthy. She ate it anyway. \n\nDiane did her calisthenics after breakfast. She had had a debate with DAD once about doing exercise on a full stomach. The computer claimed that the data was inconclusive as to whether or not there were any issues. She claimed that it made her feel queasy. They had tried doing her exercises before breakfast for a month. Afterward, DAD had shown her graphs and data about her heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood oxygen and other metrics. It showed little difference. Diane admitted that she was too hungry to exercise first anyway. DAD said that it would monitor her and ensure that everything was optimal. \n\nAnd then, it was time. \"Okay, DAD, what do I do?\" \n\n\"Go to the door and wait. It will just be a minute.\" Diane approached the door. The Door. The one portal that she had never opened. DAD claimed that it led to the Outside. For the past sixteen years, Diane had been inside these walls: a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and dining area, an exercise room and an office. And DAD. Today she turned sixteen. Today she was allowed to see Outside. \n\nThe door itself was no different from all of the others in the apartment: glossy white with a chrome lever handle. It matched the walls and ceiling. She had tried the handle a few times and knew it would not move. DAD had told her as much, but she had needed to try it herself. Finally, when she was nine, Diane had run up to it, jumped and put all of her weight on it. The handle had bent a small amount, but the door had remained firmly locked. The next day, the handle had been repaired. She had not touched it since. \n\nNow, waiting at the door, Diane felt her heart speed up, more than it had on the treadmill. What would it be like, she thought. She had seen pictures and videos and heard recordings, but that had not been the same. Even in the office with its full immersion projection walls, there had still been something missing. Or rather, as she thought about it more, something extra present: DAD. DAD would never let anything bad happen to her. There was no risk to anything she ever did. Today, she would be leaving DAD, if only for a few hours. That was exhilarating. \n\nA minute passed and nothing happened. The door did not open, no one knocked. None of the things that she had anticipated. Finally, she asked. \"DAD, is it time? What is going on?\" \n\n\"I'm sorry, Diane. There has been a small problem. I'm hoping to have it resolved in a minute.\" \n\n\"What sort of problem?\" \n\n\"Please do not be concerned. It will all be fixed soon.\" Diane waited for another five minutes, standing in front of the door, staring at the handle. She had learned patience and focus under DAD's watchful eye. But even then there are limits.",

        "I feel like I'm in a museum, looking at the strange, old echoes of a world I can't seem to fully understand. Feelings of old people, sadness that's creeped up in paint, veneer, wrinkled skin. Such stillness. Minds you just can't reach, that are always behind the horizon. I thought I would feel repulsed but I don't, my beliefs in the world are only slightly hampered, and only temporarily. Somewhere on the edge of my mind is the tendency to blame it on capitalism. As if socialism were any better. It feels too easy. It feels like I've been set up to make that connection. The endless documentaries and talking heads. Socialism is no better, and the truth of the matter is that we really don't have an answer. I have this triggered sense of superiority which I loath. Mostly because it's that: it's triggered. I don't have the answers, nobody does. Yet deep down I still feel I would never be so crazy as to take my own life. What were these people thinking when they did it? Did this forest somehow remind them of a museum? Did they want to make a statement? I was always thought committing suicide is an act of aggression. Did these people have a raging fire in their hearts, as they kneeled on the ground, quietly preparing their ropes, quietly setting up their tents? But the world played one last trick on them. It wiped out any sense of rage, of victory, even desperation. I only feel slightly less confident about the world I find myself in. A subtle sabotaging, an eerie, distant discomfort.",

        "'Commander David Strauss. That's my name and that's my Job.' Strauss thinks to himself. Playing with his new title in his head. \n\nSystems engineer for Germanys Air Force, he helped rewrite and rework the entire decaying infrastructure from scratch. Rebuilding a building as it slowly fell apart was the way he liked to describe what he did to anyone who asked. That was only 2 years ago. With that under his belt he was an obvious candidate for this Mission. \n\n6 months ago. A new high resolution telescope lens was being tested in orbit around the moon. The Pictures it obtained were being studied when an Intern working in the mail room, while on his rounds, came across the pictures and pointed out what he thought to be a smudge on the lens. A smudge on a million dollar lens the space agency worked so hard to get into space. No way that was possible. After much review and study, it was discovered that the'smudge' was in fact an opening in a crater wall on the dark side of the moon. The news was covered up quickly enough. Those working on it were paid off, the pictures edited and released to the public. China, The European Union and Russia were all called in for a meeting in Iceland. NASA led the inquiry. After plenty of finger pointing, baseless accusations, spits and several fist fights with and at one another it was concluded that this structure was not ours. At best it was a geological abnormality, at worst, a possible military structure some other nation had secretly built. 6 months later and here he was, landing on the surface on the Moon. The Russians provided the necessary distractions and Satellite Coverage for the Mission to be carried out without anyone noticing. China gave their best Rocket for the Mission, sparing no expense on equipment, re doing the entire internal system for other nations usage. NASA gave their best engineer and science officer: Jackie Hornwell, now seated opposite him in the small lander. The European Union took care of all Media and news coverage as best they could, they also coughed up their best systems engineer and military communications expert; David Strauss, and Phillip rou\u00e9 from Paris, now situated in their command vessels communication hub in stationary orbit above the crater in question. \n\nPhillip: How's it going guys? Puke bags are under your seats if you need them. Your about 30 seconds from landing. \nJackie: Fuck off Phillip \nDavid: Phillip lets maintain Radio Silence till Dr Jackie can get her bearings in order over? \nPhillip: Got it, over and out. \n\nTheir landing was as soft as it could have been expected. David moved the control pad from the side wall out in front of him and began typing in commands, checking if the systems were all still good to go. \n\nDavid: Ship looks good.

        "\"Another day in hell, right James?\" I said to my coworker as we sat poolside. \n\n\"Right. This is the last time we come to Hawaii for a client, I can't stand this torture.\" \n\nWe shared a laugh, then continued reading our books in silence. I was three hundred pages deep into a romance novel that I bought for five dollars under James' recommendation at the Wal-Mart across the street. He was reading \"The anatomy and psychology of the penguin\". He was oddly obsessed with this book, but whatever man, different strokes. \n\nI turned the page, revealing the first page of part three. The page was blank other than the bold font in the center reading \"a lovers quarrel\". I stopped reading and fell into a deep metaphorical pit of reflectance on the night I had spent fighting with my wife before I left on this damn trip. I glanced at the ring on my left ring finger, and a smile swept over my face as I basked in the feeling of her heartbeat pulsating through my ring. These rings were the first in the industry that had the touch feature, totally worth the twenty thousand dollars each in moments like these. \n\nI snapped out of it and turned the page to the content in part three. The first ten pages described a horrific case of domestic violence between two characters, a husband and wife. The man, unable to handle the marriage any longer due to his wife's severe PTSD, decided that he would kill his wife in her sleep. He succeeded, with a significant struggle on the wife's part, leaving the husband with a broken wrist and stab wound above his right hip. What a disgusting man that husband is, no wife should be harmed by her husband. \n\n\"James, why did you suggest this book, you know I love my wife.\" \n\nJames responded with silence, the slowly looked at me with a beat red face and bloodshot eyes. He screamed at the top of his lungs \"STOP IT, YOU'RE HURTING ME.\" \nKnowing James, he was playing a joke on me. \n\n\"Real funny James, cut it out.\" \n\nUpon standing from my pool chair, I awoke standing in my kitchen. There was a knife in my abdomen and my arm broken at the wrist. The ring in my finger was pulsating harder than it ever has before, then it suddenly stopped. \n\n\"Not her, please lord not her.\" I thought as I ran into our bedroom. There she was, laying on our bed. Her eyes were open and lifeless, and there was blood leaking out of a large slice in her throat. I ran back to the kitchen, pulled the knife out of my side with my healthy arm, and proceeded to sew the hole shut. That whole trip was a dream. As I thought that to myself the reality sunk in. \n\nI just killed my wife. I murdered her in my sleep. I'm going to prison if I survive. I'll get raped in prison. \n\nI laid the body of my once gorgeous wife in the trunk of my Honda Prius, grabbed my shovel, and began driving to the hills. I found a spot where I was going to bury her. \nAs I began to dig my wife's grave, my Katy Perry ringtone began to play in my pocket. I frantically answered it, blurting the first words I thought of \"I'm innocent I didn't do it!\" \n\n\"Sir, we received a notification of an irregular heartbeat on your wife's touch band, is she alright?\"",
        "No one can quite remember when the Last War started. Our best guess was a few years after the Great Doom, when the outside world was destroyed and our store became the only remaining sanctuary left. In response to a milk shortage, Dairy raised their prices astronomically, prompting Pharmacy to do the same. That was the final straw. Butter and milk is one thing, but when no one can afford antibiotics, it's just a matter of time until everything exploded. \n\nSporting Goods and Automotive aligned together and struck the first blow. They had grown very militaristic since the Doom, as they had the only access to dangerous weapons and equipment at the time. They invaded Pharmacy and annexed them. There isn't much a pill bottle or thermometer can do against the Tire Knights once they were armed with rifles and hunting knives. They struck a deal with Grocery, food in exchange for medicine, and the three factions quickly established themselves as the dominant alliance. \n\nBut it didn't last. It never did. The legend goes that black-hat operatives from Electronics staged a false flag operation to make it look like Automotive had been stealing guns and crossbows, using those weapons to trade Fashion for free-flowing clothes, then selling the clothing back to Sporting Goods. That became the bloodiest civil war in our history, even more violent than the Familial War, when Men's, Women's, and Kid's splintered. \n\nAll this was so many years ago. So much time has passed that few can even remember why we fight, or what the Outside is like. Division and mistrust is so embedded here, there is great doubt if the store could ever run again, all the sections in harmony, operating the massive commercial outpost it was before. But war has never bothered me, or my fathers, or their fathers before them. For a hundred generations we have existed alongside war, but war has never affected us. Our section remains the lone island in this turbulent sea of conflict. \n\nWhy is that, you ask? It's simple. Our tribe is the Keeper of the Gardening section, the Watcher of the Harvest.",
        "\u201c The crowd outside has reached bedlam. And by that I mean\u2026 it hasn't. \u201d \n\n\nPolice Chief Petunia was stumped. He cradled his soy milk half-caf delicately in his manicured fingers. \n\n\n\u201c When I first joined the force these kids meant business. They were up in arms, sticking rose petals in carbines or sitting at the counter of Woolworth's\u2026. sinisterly\u2026. just waiting for a nightstick to the midsection or a fire hose blast to the sternum. Bring me the new recruit. \u201d \n\n\nPolice Chief Petunia took a sip from his drink, furrowed his brow, and then tore the lid off of a sugar dispenser filled with low calorie artificial sweetener labeled \u201c organic. \u201d He poured the majority of the contents into his drink. It immediately crystallized into some form of viscous sludge. A meek young man, just a few days removed from his 18th birthday, ambled towards him. \n\n\n\u201c H\u2026 hello Chief. I don't know why Officer Stacy thought my hands were down my uniform but I can assure you\u2026 \u201d \n\n\n\u201c Enough. We have a job for you, Cadet Deefus. I've been Chief of Police here in Stagsack for 28 years, and never have I seen a protest like this. These kids are so\u2026 placid. So calm. They must be stopped. \u201d \n\n\nCadet Deefus stood there, small-armed and soft-bellied, his slack jaw hanging in direct parallel to his delicate unibrow. \n\n\n\u201c S\u2026 stopped, sir? \u201d \n\n\nPolice Chief Petunia strolled over to a locker with a menacing looking exterior lock. He gently tugged at it and it snapped open. He reached inside the locker and pulled out various articles of clothing. \n\n\n\u201c Here is your riot gear, cadet. You're going out to the front lines. We can't assure your safety\u2026 but we can assure you that a reasonably priced plaque will be hung in your honor. Haven't you always wanted to be a hero, son? \u201d \n\n\nCadet Deefus stuck out his gaunt arms, collecting the riot gear from Police Chief Petunia. A pair of lensless horn-rimmed glasses. A green cardigan. A tight pair of khakis. And most importantly, wingtips. \n\n\n\u201c Put these on. Report to the front lines. When I give you the signal, you charge. \u201d \n\n\n\u201c Ch\u2026 charge the protestors, sir? But they're just sitting there\u2026 \u201d \n\n\n\u201c If I wanted you to charge them I would have said so! No. I will be out there with Officer Stacy and the better half of our K-9 unit. I want you to charge towards us! \u201d \n\n\n\u201c S... sir? \u201d \n\n\n\u201c You heard me cadet! Now get moving. \u201d \n\n\nA rotund lump formed in Cadet Deefus's meager throat. He shrugged his shoulders, removed his uniform and placed the riot gear over his meager frame. The door lightly shook on its hinges as he attempted to slam it on his way out. \n\n\nOutside of the police building the crowd had grown complacent. The rally cries of \u201c Mock our sins no more! \u201d ceased to ring out through the idyllic Vermont rolling hillsides. Nobody knew what exactly had precipitated the beginning of this pro-Wingtip protest, and nobody seemed to wonder why. A thin figure gawked at the crowd from inside the door, before being pushed out by a sturdy hand with well-polished fingernails. \n\n\n\u201c Uh\u2026 uh\u2026. Up with Wingtips! \u201d \n\n\nA quiet rally cry returned the sentiment. \n\n\n\u201c No more moccasins! \u201d \n\n\nA second rally cry, quieter than the first, re-affirmed the notion. \n\n\nCadet Deefus cast a furtive glance towards the headquarters, as a squadron of heavily armed officers and hungry German Shepherds advanced towards the reclining protestors. Police Chief Petunia raised his riot shield in the air three times; the unmistakable international symbol for \u201c charge at me. \u201d Cadet Deefus removed a wingtip and tossed it towards the officers, the loafer covering half the distance between his limp wrist and the intimidating legion of officers. The sinewy legs of Cadet Deefus ran towards the battalion. \n\n\n\u201c Fire up the tear gas, boys. \u201d \n\n\nNo fewer than three canisters of Civil Rights grade tear gas sprang out from the officers, landing upon the unsuspecting protestors like artillery fire. One round hit a small dog, who bit the crotch of the closest individual. The pro-Wingtip crowd began coughing, sneezing, choking, vomiting, oozing and crying. A thick fog formed over the crowd and visibility fell to zero. \n\n\n\u201c You know what to do! \u201d \n\n\nCadet Deefus had no idea what to do. His eyes burned, his throat was dry, a burning rash was forming on his skin and his dry heaves were causing him severe discomfort. The police pounced upon him, their batons ready. \n\n\n\u201c Here's one right here! 200 points! \u201d \n\n\nFortunately for Cadet Deefus he did not suffer long, as he quickly lost consciousness upon reaching his pain threshold. He woke up several days later, in a plastic bed, a bronze plaque dangling from Police Chief Petunia's supple hands.",
        "Colin and Felicity were the proudest of parents. Little Rupert had been born in perfect health. They had held each other and beamed as Rupert was transferred by the doctor into the genetic coding chamber. \n\n\"Are you ready to program your son?\" Asked the doctor with a smile. \n\nColin and Felicity looked at each other nodding. \"Yes,\" said Felicity, grasping Colin's hand. \"Yes we are.\" \n\nRupert was placed in the gene manipulation chamber. The machine had put an end to genetic disease overnight, as it allowed the traits of newborns to be selected by the parents. However, while dangerous genomes would automatically be modified,'luxury alterations' (as they were known) were effected by means of chance. \n\nExcessive populational perfection was deemed dangerous and undesirable by various governing bodies. So, parents would roll dice to determine how their child would develop. \n\n\"OK,\" said the doctor. The contraption looked like a vending machine, and he motioned to a hole that looked like something for dispensing change. \"Collect the dice from here,\" he said, \"and drop them in the hole up here. The machine will reveal the number of the roll, and that score will then represent the ability of your child in that particular area. Once you have the score, press next here and the dice will drop again.\" The doctor puffed out his cheeks and laughed. \"Any questions?\" \n\n\"No,\" said Colin, looking at Felicity. \"I think we've got it, thanks.\" \n\n\"Then over to you,\" he chirped. \n\nAlone in the room with his wife and child, Colin walked over to the machine, pressing his palm against the glass. Rupert looked perfect already. Felicity watched on from the bed. \n\n\"What is the first trait?\" She asked excitedly. \n\n\"Beauty,\" said Colin. He took the dice from the tray. \"Ready?\" He asked, looking back at Felicity. \n\n\"Yes, do it.\" She made a high pitched whine of excitement. \n\nColin dropped the dice into the slot, heard some clicking, followed by a small rattle, and then a gulp. A digital display behind Rupert read'6'. \n\n\"Yeah!\" Shouted Colin. \"Six out of six! Our kid is going to be a looker!\" \n\nBoth parents celebrated and wooped, they high-fived and hugged, and after a minute or two, having pressed'next', Colin was again collecting the dice. \n\nHe turned around with a look of seriousness. Fiona looked suddenly concerned. \n\n\"Is there a problem?\" She asked. \n\n\"This next one is intelligence,\" said Colin soberly. \n\nFelicity gasped. \"Make sure you roll it well,\" she warned, and put her hands together and began to pray. \n\nColin nodded, and turned back to the machine. He exhaled deeply. He dropped the dice in the hole - click, rattle, gulp - and the machine read'3'. \n\n\"What is it?\" Cried Felicity. \n\n\"Three,\" said Colin. For a moment there was silence. \n\nFelicity looked up with concentration. \"You know, three isn't too bad, Colin?\" \n\nColin pondered the score. \"No, I suppose not.\" \n\n\"After all,\" said Felicity, \"Jerry's boy rolled low for intelligence! Margaret told me so\" \n\n\"Jerry's boy?\" Said Colin incredulously. \"Well he seems perfectly bright to me...\" \n\n\"Well exactly,\" said Felicity. \"And our Rupert has a three! That's not even low! It's middle of the road!\" \n\n\"Middle of the road...\" Parroted Colin with wonder. He suddenly felt quite pleased with himself and pressed'next' with renewed optimism.",
        "*Did he not wash off this plate? No, of course not. The ketchup is dried and stuck to the damn plate, and whatever bread-covered thing he ate is seemingly glued to the porcelain as well. * \n\n*And, oh look, wonderful, great! He drank milk and didn't wash it out, love the look of sour solidified dairy in the bottom of a cup. I can't even reach the bottom. * The dull white ring looked up like an O from the bottom of the glass. *It's Hell, alright, not even providing something that can reach down tall glasses. * \n\n*And here's another mac and cheese crusted pot, not set in hot water to soak. For fuck's sake.... He's Lucifer and all, but damn dude, all you have to do is fill it with warm soapy water. Would make my life helluva easier! * \n\n*Sucha' lazy piece of shit, he is.

I'll do some plates now and have them out on the drying rack here soon.\" \n\n\"Good.\" He turned and left, leaving charred rings in the marble floor. \n\n*I'd love to ram his damn plates down his throat and watch him die slowly. And his stupid friends, other demons from dumb places that no one even know existed. In'Pher? That's not even a damn planet. Oblivion? Does anyone even go there, ever? And what about Limbo? A middle-man, just a middle-man, why even have a ruler there, really? * \n\n*Another bowl covered in dried out oatmeal! GOD DAMMIT! Fuck this place, fuck him, fuck everything! I'm done! I'm quitting! I rather be pronged and raped by a dozen demons that have to grind away at a bowl for the next hour because he couldn't just wash it out before setting it in the sink!

        "Looking in the mirror, Lee though to himself: *I'm a really evil person\". He smiled. *I might actually be the most evil there is*. The smug smirk on his face because even more pronounced. His grin widened. *I wonder if I can get even more evil*. He stayed for one more minute in front of the mirror, thinking. Then, his face suddenly lit up, as if a brilliant idea just crossed his perverted mind. He went to his computer, along the way kicking his malnourished dog in the stomach. At his desk, he typed \"demon summoning 101\". For good luck, or bad luck depending on how you put it, he went to the 66th page if the results and clicked on the 6th link. There, his found some instructions. *Let's see, I need someone human blood to draw a pentagram and I need to recite Demonicum Invocatio Abadonum three times while holding a candle*. The site said \"use your own blood\". *Bullshit! * Lee cried. He got up, went to the basement and drew some blood from the homeless person he kept chained down there. Before leaving, he proceeded to kick his prisoner, for no other reason than the pleasure he felt when he hurt others. He got a candle, drew the pentagram on the middle of the floor and proceeded to do the invocation. A few moments pass and he hears a deep voice. \n\n*This is Abbadon, demon lord of despair and destruction, who dares summon me? * \n\n*Yeah, hi, this is Lee. Cool, so it worked. Well, I'm an evil person and I want to be possessed by a demon to become even more evil* \n\nSilence for a moment. \n\n*Very well spoke Abbadon* A bright red flesh engulfed Lee for a moment. *You are now possessed by me. I shall plant evil thoughts into your mind and you shall obey me! I see you have a dog. You will not feed your dog daily from now on, it shall only receive food every other day! * \n\n*Urgh, mkay* Lee was a bit disappointed. Guessing the demon was just warming up he put a coat on and left. \n\n*Where are we going? * Asked Abbadon. *Do you have evil deeds in mind or are you in need of more suggestions? * \n\n*I'm going to the hospital to molest some babies* replied Lee. *Got something more evil to do? I've been contemplating genocide for a while but it's a bit hard to not get caught* \n\n*Wtf dude!? * Abbadon was clearly surprised. *What do you mean you go to molest babies? What sort of sick fu & k are you?! * \n\n*Yeah, I'm a doctor, I work the night shifts and have access to the maternity ward. When they discover abused babies, they always blame the janitors. Idiots! * \n\nAbbadon was not expecting this. \n\n*Here's a bank, look, just, just go in and tell them you want to be a banker.",
        "``.... And that's why this drug is suitable for those suffering from Garlic Allergy. All tests, data and samples are available to the FDA, and I hope you can pass this soon, to alleviate the sufferering of those with allergy to Allium sativum.\" I smiled at the board who listened in silence. Not once did I mention my *true* reason for my experimentation; why, they'd never believe me. No, better to hide it behind a facade of mortal suffering. \nA cough freed me from my thoughts. The senior scientist of the group had faced me with a cryptic look on his face. \n\"That's.... all very well, Mr Chiroptera, but this isn't why you made it.\" My grin froze on my face, does he susp.... \n\"The reason you made it was to free Vampires from one of their weaknesses. And that will not happen.\" I attempted to stutter an objection, \"how - how *absurd*. Vampires? I am...\" \n\"A Vampire. We know. And we've known about this garlic cure for a long time.\" A whisper of wind behind me; I turned with inhuman speed, but too late, the mailed fist grabbed me by the the neck and slammed me to the table. A laser pen, of all things, was shoved in my eye. \n\"*This little trinket gives a high intensity UV beam. It will fry your brain if you so much as twitch*\" growled my captor. A waft of his smell informed me as to his true nature. \n\"Werewolf\" I whispered. \n\"Indeed, Mr Chiroptera! Or should I say Baron Alcar. Yes, Frank here is one of the FDA's most helpful agents in these matters.\" \n\"If you were a proper scientist, you would have known we do not normally give interviews to vouch for your drug. No, we want to offer you a *job*\" \nA job? Hah!",
        "Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. \n\nMidnight. It was officially her 30th birthday. Alone in the darkened apartment she took a sip of her whiskey. This is the year she has to make her decision. Does she live on or volunteer for eradication. Another sip from the glass. It wasn't fair dammit. She didn't want to die. Despite the crowded streets and high rise apartments, despite waiting in lines for hours for rations, despite the smog storms and the violence, despite all of it \u2026 she wanted to live. \n\nLiving came with a price, however. You were kicked out of the city for one. No more apartment, no more rations. No more whiskey, she supposed. But what did dying get you? Well \u2026 dead for, one. It was considered the noble life choice after all. She got up from her chair and crossed over to the only window in the small apartment, peering out over the city. \n\nShe wondered how many other birthdays there were today. How many people were faced with the same choice she now faced. Live or die. Another sip from the glass. The whiskey was fogging her mind, but the numbness was welcome. She and been anticipating this day for over a year now but still could not make up her mind. The government generously allowed you 30 days from midnight of your 30th birthday to decide your own fate. A great many chose death, their names forever etched in the Great Tower of Life at the center of town. Some decided to take their chances outside the wall, many of whom were never heard from again. Anyone who did not make their decision was taken away by the government. It was assumed they were killed but their names were never etched on the tower. Truth was no one really knew what happened to those who failed to make the choice. \n\nShe opened the window to her apartment. The cool night air felt good on her flushed face. * \u201d I want to live, \u201d * she thought to herself. She leaned over the edge of the window looking down the 20 stories to the ground. * \u201d I want to live, \u201d * she thought again leaning even further over the edge closing her eyes. * \u201d I want to live \u201d * she released the glass from her hand letting it fall to the ground far below.",
        "\"Are you mad?\" she said to be, eyes wide and full of fear. \n\n\"Mad? No. I'm not mad,\" I replied. \"I'm just.... I'm overwhelmed.\" \n\nI thought back to all the times we had spent playing together. The nights we had spent cuddling under the warm blanket on the upstairs couch. I could remember so many of the meals I had made for her and how much we enjoyed each other's company. I had always known that our bond was special, but now this. And this was just.... it was something else. \n\n\"It's bothering you, I can tell,\" she said to me softly. \"You've got the far-away look on your face, the one you always affect when you want to pretend like something isn't bothering you.\" \n\n\"It's not that.\" \n\n\"But it is. You can not lie to me. You need to understand that. Voxangelikus, this won't change things between us.\" \n\nThat was a laugh. How could something this big not completely and permanently alter the entire foundation of our relationship? It would be like waking up and finding out that the blue sky above you for all of these years was actually neon pink. Even though you'd eventually get used to it you'd still always think of the sky as blue, not hot pink. \n\n\"Things are already changed,\" I said. \"You know they are.\" \n\n\"No,\" she purred, trying to pull herself against me. I pulled away and could sense her disappointment. She sighed heavily. \"Yes. Things are changed. But it doesn't have to be bad, you know. We can still make things work out. It can maybe even be better than before.\" \n\nMaybe she was right. Maybe things could work out in the end. They would always be a little weird or difficult, but then again, our entire relationship had always had an element of strangeness to it, so it wasn't that far-fetched to think this might work out somehow. I put my hand on her head and rubbed behind her neck. I scratched her behind the ears and rubbed her on the butt. Her back arched up and she purred heartily and said, \"That feels so nice!\"",
        "I loved to lay in bed at night and feel the gentle rise and fall of her chest. To see the quirky way she smiled as she dreamed. Sometimes I would sit for hours trying to decipher whatever it was she was saying in her sleep, hoping there might be some message for me. I knew she loved me. She always made me feel loved. \n\nThen there were times when she would furrow her brow and look frustrated and even scared. I wondered if those were dreams of being chased. I'd lay my head against her chest and hear her heart pounding in those moments. I'd wonder what was chasing her, was it someone she knew, was it a wild animal, a dog even. The thought scared me too. \n\nBut I had her and that was all I needed for now. So night after night we'd have dinner together and she would tell me about her day. Then at the end, we'd settle into bed together and drift off to sleep. Except that she almost always fidgeted and woke me up. It was fine, though, I preferred it even. Because then I got to lay here and listen to her breath. \n\nI wish I could love her like she does me, but I just can't. Especially not after how she acted toward the presents I gave her. I'd have my revenge for that.",
        "And so he bitterly asked, \"Why?\" \n\nI answered \"Because I'm the sort of dick that submits writing that really can't even be considered a story to /r/WritingPrompts\" \n\nHe then said \"Mods!

        "\"Bloody Hell, really?\" \n\nThe imp shrugged. \"Not my problem, I use the same charts come across the smoke signals every week, same as everyone else what's sellin, same as everyone else what's buyin.\" he said in his animated little growl. \"It's the same bloody drink an- \"\n\n\"No,\" said Azazel, \"I meant, I didn't realise it was that bad.\" \n\n\"Do you want it or not?\" \n\n\"Fine,\" Azazel replied, and threw the twenty over for the pint of blood. He carried it deftly back across The Two Horns, avoiding the eyes of the gorgon who'd been haunting him for the better part of that month. He slid back down onto the bench and regarded the pint in front of him, still trying to work out whether he'd been deceived. \n\n\"Something wrong with the sauce, son?\" Mephisto nudged his elbow with the question, bringing Azazel out of his trance. \n\n\"Cost me twenty, that did.\" \n\n\"Same as mine.\" \n\n\"Yea. What I'm saying is, pints cost twenty now?\" \n\n\"You haven't been up in a while have you mate?\" \n\n\"Well, I'm not the salesman like you, Meph,\" said Azazel, allowing his annoyance to carry over into the conversation. \"I did my job and now I'm done.\" \n\n\"Expecting a better return on investment, were you?\" \n\n\"I suppose. How many of them are there now?\" \n\n\"Bout, 7? Bit more.\" \n\n\"Christ.\" \nMephisto laughed. \"I know man. Soon it'll cost less to just go up and buy a pint there.\" \n\n\"I mean, are they doing anything about it? You're the economist. I mean. I won't be able to afford coming here soon.\" \n\n\"Not much they can do,\" Mephisto said as he combined a sip and a shrug, \"Pandae keeps moanin on about whatever they can, but they and everyone else have been realising how long they've been caught twiddling their tails. Basically, right at the same time the population began to explode, which was coz of the industrial revolution, basically, Heaven put in these new policies that are just now starting to pay off.\" The salesman inside him was getting excited now, which was the cause of the rambling. Loved to have something complicated to explain, especially when it involved spiritual currency. \"They've been long-conning us, for sure. We thought we'd had the whole thing wrapped up what with the whole human race being born into damnation. But with predestination, that made everyone work as hard as they could to convince themselves they were predestined. And Heaven was able to skim off the top and send the rest to us, and we thought, sounds like a pretty good deal. Now we're realising that quantity is not better than quality. What they've managed to do is send Hell's entire economy downwards, pardon the expression.",
        "It wasn't a long trip to the bottom, but it wasn't a short one either. If he'd had to guess, Callum would have said it was somewhere between the time it takes to say * \u201c God bless you \u201d * and the time it takes for a candle to snuff out with a final soft *whoof*. \n\nIt was the summer of 1973. Elton John had just released his album \u201c *Goodbye Yellow Brick Road* \u201d - his seventh and most popular yet - and the troops had returned home from Vietnam. (\u201c *God bless us, Halleluiah! * \u201d Callum's mother had said to the gaggle of family members gathered around the television at the time, planting a kiss on a reluctant Callum's head.) In many ways it was an End Summer. It carried with it a sense of things coming to a close, of things changing, and as the hour-hand wound its way to Fall on the great grandfather clock in the hall a part of Callum *did* end; there, behind the A plus One convenience store. Though he wouldn't know it at the time, his childhood had slipped away that summer - like sand through the crack in an hourglass - and only much later would he realise; some things you just can not mend. \n\nIt was such a logical conclusion to reach, but since when had men in their youth ever been logical? The group met on the edge of the great-wide parking lot behind the A plus One convenience store - owned by a St. Peters catholic who both smoked and smiled heartily (and was known for pushing a pack of cigarettes over the counter when handed a crumpled twenty. *God bless us, Halleluiah! *) Their self-proclaimed leader - through words if not through clout - was a boy named Cedric O'Brian; tall, waxen, with the hint of a mustache meticulously maintained on his upper lip, and known for such words as \u201c *Fuck* \u201d (which came out *Fack*), \u201c *Cunt* \u201d (which came out *Caunt*), and any other combination of the two (*Fackin'caunt* being the most popular).",
        "Susan Hampton. My mother. She was kind, intelligent, endearing, and everything in between. She was honest, yet considerate. Lax, but efficient. She was destined to be a working mother: one of the toughest jobs in the world. She provided a loving home, and in turn, I gave her the only thing I could -- unconditional love. \n\nI try my best to remember everything about her. The sweet smell of her shampoo that I always got a face-full of as I entered her loving arms. Her favorite plum-colored shirt, that was a bit too big, but comfy nonetheless. Even the way she hugged Dad; desperately clinging to him, not just because she needed someone, but because it hurt to let go, even while knowing full well that he couldn't care less if she did. \n\nShe was a fighter. And she was a winner, although not by force. Every punch, both physical and emotional, she knew exactly how to dodge. I envied her for this ability, while also admiring her for it with all of my being. It was the most satisfying sound, his belt, cracking in the air as she quickly ducked, disabling a dicttor of his absolute power, even if only for a second. It was something I would never dream of doing -- yet she did it so fearlessly, even whilst understanding the consequences of her actions. \n\nAs I think back now, she did it for me. She wanted to show me something. She needed something, *anything* to inspire her son to rebel. But he didn't. I didn't. \n\nI took every hit, wincing as the belt cracked on my back. \"I fell of my bike,\" I would say. *\" Got cut in the woods. \"* And my mother would know. She would *wait*. Wait for me to speak up. But I didn't. I never did. \n\nBut it doesn't make any difference now.",

        "5:11 AM. My eyes open in darkness. I throw off my comforter, stumble to my feet. \n\nThen I'm running. \n\nDown the stairs, out the door. Wearing nothing but a white shirt and nylon shorts. I sprint, vaulting over a fire hydrant. \n\nThe city is just waking up, and I've never been happier to live in a shitty second floor studio downtown. People are always awake downtown. People are always moving. And with the sun just hitting the skyline above me, I have just enough time. \n\nJust enough time to clothesline the bike messenger passing by. Just enough time to jump on his bike and pedal a full block before he can catch his breath. Before he has the opportunity to call the cops. \n\nTwo blocks down, one block over. 5:14 AM. Thank God it's all downhill. Well.... mostly downhill. But it's just enough time to knock a businessman walking out of his office after pulling two all-nighters to the ground. Jumping off the bike, I grab his keys. I hear his scream from the fall, broken left leg is a bitch, but I know I only have just enough time. \n\nEnough time to make it to his yellow sports car, to floor the engine. 0-60 in under seven seconds is quite useful. Especially right now. Look, It's not like he should use it. He would crash, killing a mother and two daughters. His wife, his two kids. He should thank me. \n\n7 blocks zoom by as a blur, revving the engine faster and faster. Weaving my way down the dreary grey concrete slabs. Passing taxis, early morning vendors. College kids making their way to whatever God-forsaken coffee joint they work at this early in the morning. 5:20 AM. \n\nWoman walking her dog makes her way into the crosswalk. Shit. Can't lose focus. Dodge woman, turn right. Slam the breaks, spin out. Car flips, airbags deploy. Car lands in a smoking heap in the middle of a crosswalk. 5:21 AM. \n\nI crawl out of the wreckage as the few dreary-eyed people come rushing over. Two blocks. Just two blocks. I run. Blood pounding, also running from my leg. Someone grabs at me, I return a right hook. He's down, I'm running. 5:22 AM. \n\nI see her as she makes her way through the crosswalk. I see the tanker, brakes out, come barreling towards her. The tanker was two months out of registration, due to not being properly checked. Driver running a suspended license. Gas company didn't give two shits as the guy was always quick to deliver. She doesn't hear the horn, music blasting with noise cancelling headphones. \n\nI had bought her those for our anniversary. \n\nTruck barrels over her, head hits ground. Given relative flatness of city streets, truck was only going 45 mph. Still enough to crack her skull, internal bleeding and hemorrhaging. Dead in under a minute. \n\nI'm there, she's in my arms, tears streaming. Shock absorbs the pain, she has just enough energy to put her hand on my cheek, and smile. I try to shush her, as tears roll down my face, clutching her still form. \n\nGas seeps out from the tanker, which had veered into a store across the street. Driver's cigarette, of all things, lights the fumes.",
        "**Have you ever felt anxiety-induced slow-motion? ** \n\nThe technical term is \"time dilation\" which I've always enjoyed. \n\nI had always been a frugal young man, but one thing I've always splurged on is the next best set of headphones. \n\nI enjoyed \"Piano Concerto No. 12 in A Major\" whilst observing the utter chaos surrounding me. \n\nI've always been nervous on planes.

        "Forward: \n\nI am writing to you now in the hopes that our mistakes be not repeated. Countless dead and more wishing they had met the same fate. The human race is reaching a point of no return. The planet as we know it is changing; naturally and unnaturally. Our survival options are running thin. If peace does not come soon, I fear our existence will burn out like the dying light of an old star. At this point, it does not matter how the war began, nor does it matter what happened in between. Diplomacy failed, human decency failed, compassion, love, friendship, all failed. I failed. The war is not over. \n\nIf you are reading this, your ancestors survived, they pushed forward. If you are still fighting, I am sorry; heed my words and pass them on. We were so close to a golden age. A time of great expansion across the galaxy. It was all planned, but the best laid plans of mice and men, always go awry. I truly believe had our plans worked, the war, everything, could have been avoided. The course of human history has been irreparably damaged, pushing us to the verge of oblivion. Our technology was close, but still so very far from the one thing that could save us. Change the past. Find a way to come back.",
        "From: connors @ hudson.edu \nTo: editors @ biotechjournal.com \n\nSubject: re: decision on manuscript 268901j \n\nTo the editors: \n\nWe thank you and the reviewers for the helpful comments regarding our manuscript \"DNA donation from Eumeces laticeps promotes limb regeneration in humans.\" While we acknowledge that the editors have final say in the decision to accept or reject a submission, would like to address some of the major criticisms brought up by the reviewers. \n\nReviewer 1: \n\nWe thank reviewer 1 for his assessment that the manuscript should be accepted with no further revisions. \n\nReviewer 2: \n\n\"The title of the paper is somewhat misleading, as the vast majority of experiments were performed on murine models. Indeed, only one human subject was studied. Due to this extremely small sample size, I don't believe the conclusion that the method may represent a general therapy for humans is justified.\" \n\nWe agree with reviewer 2's assessment, and are willing to remove the word \"humans\" from the paper title, along with scaling back our claims in the conclusions section. \n\n\"It appears that no human subjects protocols were followed in this study, calling into question whether or not it violates ethical grounds. Furthermore, side effects of the treatment were not addressed, and no follow-up regarding the subject's physical condition was reported.\" \n\nWhile we admit that no human subjects protocol was submitted, we do not believe any breach of ethics occurred. Suffice to say that the subject was extremely well informed regarding the procedure. Additionally, we believe that any follow-ups regarding the subject's condition subsequent to the treatment are beyond the scope of this work. \n\nReviewer 3: \n\n\"This study is completely insane and so are the authors.\" \n\nIn general, we found reviewer 3's remarks to be unprofessional and inconsistent with the spirit of peer review. \n\n\"There is no way that you can combine mouse and lizard genomes as described in this work. What is the result, some sort of mouse-lizard hybrid? That's about as plausible as a human-arachnid hybrid.\" \n\nWe refer reviewer 3 to the whole genome sequencing provided in the supplementary information. \n\n\"Additionally, the timescale given for limb regrowth is completely unrealistic. One does not regenerate a new appendage in a matter of days. I suggest that this paper be completely discounted as fraudulent and its authors seriously considered for psychiatric evaluation.\" \n\nIf reviewer 3 truly doubts the validity of this study, I kindly suggest that a demonstration of the newly grown limb (s) be arranged at his or her convenience. \n\n\nAs you can see, we strongly believe that the far-reaching implications of our work for the field of medicine make it ideally suited for a journal with the wide scope and readership of Biotechnology Journal.",
        "Finally. The letter were coming into place. I just needed one more- *one more! * piece. I sat at the usual spot, waiting for my little messenger. It had become routine now, I wait, they deliver, with a brief message. Just yesterday, they had told me, \"This will be the last.\" Finally, I can add it all up after today. \n\nI don't wait for long; a hooded man sat down besides me, and slid me an envelope. \"Open them in order of the dates you received them.\" He got up, disappearing into the crowds. \n\nI pocket the envelope, and head home to my small, but livable apartment. Fumbling around for my keys, I unlock the door. In a rush of excitement, I almost trip over one of my chairs, but managed to keep upright. I displayed all of the five envelopes. Each were dated from September 20th to the 24th, which was today. \n\nStarting with the first one, the 20th, I cut open the envelope. The contents fall out of it. A card, reading \"There\". I shake the envelope, hoping for more. There is none. I turned over the card, only to find it blank, so I presumed it was a message with the rest of the contents combined. I cut open the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd envelopes, and displayed the cards next to each other in chronological order.",

        "The Earth was old, and tired. Her seas and lands were brown, and all but the hardiest of the life she had once nurtured had died long, long ago. Their killers had abandoned her for the stars, fleeing for a thousand years, thinking never to return. \n\nBut they had. They had returned older, and wiser, and wholly different. They were nothing like the life that had once lived here, but they remembered those who had come before them, and what they had lost. And they mourned. \n\nThe Earth was a holy place, and there was but one space station above it in this time. It was a place of pilgrimage that all humans aspired to one day visit, to pay their respects to their point of origin, and be humbled by how all of their race had once been confined to a single globe. If there were any who remembered the place, they might have compared it to the Mecca of old. \n\nIt was there that a small council of humans had gathered, with the hope of undoing it all. \n\nIn the center chamber of the space station, there was a time machine. It was by this machine that most travelers arrived, opening a portal to it from their own position in spacetime. It was pyramid shaped, and for the moment, inactive. The council was gathered in a great circular crowd around it. \n\n\"We are gathered,\" a voice boomed from the crowd. \n\n\"We are gathered,\" a chorus of voices agreed, in a thousand different accents and tones and cadences. \n\n\"This is futile,\" a voice protested. \"We can not change the flow of time. If we try, we have already failed.\" \n\n\"Agreed,\" some few voices said. \n\n\"Perhaps,\" said a different voice, from somewhere else in the crowd. \"But we must try all the same, for if we do not try, we have failed even more surely.\" \n\n\"Agreed,\" said almost all the voices gathered. \n\n\"But who will go?\" asked the first, booming voice. \n\nThere was a long silence as everyone looked to their neighbors. Then, two stepped forward, one followed by the other, out of the crowd. \n\nOne was a female, with curving hips and long legs, and a curving, elongated head. Her eyes glowed blue, and her white, smooth skin shone like a strange pearl, completely unconcealed by any garments. \n\nThe second was a male, short and extremely thin, with compact, wire-like muscles and an overlarge head. His eyes were slanted, huge, and dark, standing out against his dull grey skin as he looked out at the assembled council. \n\n\"We will go,\" he said in a high, musical voice. \n\n\"They shall go,\" a thousand voices agreed. \n\n\"But to when?\" asked the same voice that had protested before. \"How will we know when to send them? The histories are lost.\" \n\n\"Not all of them,\" responded a new voice. It's owner stood near the inner edge of the circle, and so many could see him. He was short, and thick, with powerful muscles and four strong arms folded across his chest. \"We know with certainty the time of two events, from relics left on Earth. We know when civilization began, and when it ended. We will send a volunteer to each.\" \n\n\"We will,\" said the council together. \n\nThe two looked to each other, and the pearl woman knelt to kiss the gray man. \"I will wait for your arrival,\" she whispered to him, and then stood, and spoke. \"I shall travel to the beginning,\" she told the council. \"I shall keep watch for ways I might guide our ancestors towards technology that does not harm nature.\" \n\n\"She shall,\" said the council, and the pyramid opened to accept her. She looked one last time at the gray man, and stepped inside, and through the portal within. \n\nSimple as that, she was gone. The gray man looked to the pyramid for a long, silent moment.",
        "Jeffery closed the door behind him and stepped out into the hallway. He was hurried in his movements, and would have been running if he thought it wouldn't disturb the patients. Or the orderlies, for that matter. Nobody likes a running doctor. \n\nJesus had been here long before the good doctor had transferred in. The first Jesus, anyway. The second had come nearly a year after the doctor. In the world of delusions, believing yourself to be Jesus is hardly enough to lock someone away. The facility here was more of a resort. No violent patients, it probably saw less trouble than the average retirement home. But now, it had two Jesus's. And then there was three. \n\nWhat struck Dr Jeffery Jones as odd, however, wasn't that three men claimed to be the same person named Jesus of Nazareth. It was that the three men were all named after the apostles. Mark John, Phillip Thomas and James Matthew sat in the otherwise empty room, and if he didn't hurry, he was going to miss whatever they had to say to each other. \n\nIt was risky, of course, to do this. Three men with similar delusions would never be allowed in the same room under normal circumstances. Three men with conflicting delusions even more so, for surely there can be only one Jesus of Nazareth. But they had done it anyway. They tried introducing them to each other in the presence of Dr Jones, but that had failed. not one word, did they say to each other. \n\nSo now he was hurrying, hurrying to were he could watch them without being present in the room. He just about burst through the door into the observation room, startling his assistant as he always did. Passion, he had once said, had no substitute in anything in life, including work. She sighed at him, and shook her head. \n\n\"How are they?\" \n\nShe frowned. \n\n\"They? You made it very clear to empty the room before we let Jesus in, Doctor Jones.\" \n\nHe sighed, now, shaking his head. \n\n\"Very funny, Abigail. Whats going on?\" \n\nHe made his way to the window, and frowned through the glass. Where there should have been three chairs, there was only one. \n\n\"He's just been sitting there. What's the joke?\" \n\nHe frowned again. \n\n\"Where are the other two?\" \n\n\"The other two what?\" \n\n\"Jesus's.\" \n\nNow Abigail was frowning. \n\n\"There's only one Jesus, Jeff. There's always only been one Jesus.\" \n\nHe looked back at her puzzled expression before looking back through the glass. Mark John looked back at him. No, maybe it was Philip Thomas, or was it James Matthew? The lights were too bright to tell.",
        "The sky was overcast and dark in general. Smith approached the small house. It was fairly far from the villages, isolated. Such homes were reserved for solitary types. It had been newly built, in expectation of new arrivals. He took out his pen, clicked it, and turned a page over on his clipboard. \"Michael Fitzgerald\" was his next visit. At the rate people died, performing routine population checks in the Afterlife became a very important task. And to think the place was little more than a desert thousands of years back. Smith himself had been here for centuries. But modernising wasn't difficult, what with all the new people. The Afterlife was an open minded place. With death and harm no longer be a concern, many worries that were once present were now gone. People took time to hang out. \n\nWhich is why solitary homes such as Fitzgerald's were such an oddity. \n\nSmith entered, without knocking. Knocking wasn't the norm there. He examined the entrance. Bland. There was no wallpaper on the walls, and no carpets on the ground. \n\nA figure walked around a corner. A small man, fairly ugly and overweight, emerged, wearing a frown on his face. He ogled Smith askance and, clearly trying to suppress a bout of anger, checking his pulse while doing so. \n\n\"Recensement, I presume. ``, the small man said, not bothering to look Smith in the eyes. \n\n\"Yes, Mr Fitzgerald. ``, said Smith. \"I have a few questions for you.\" \n\n'Sit down. Make it quick.\" \n\nFitzgerald pointed to a small metal stool in a corner. Smith pulled it and sat down. He was a tall fellow and as such, sitting down brought him to eye level with Fitzgerald. Smith himself was fairly robust, with a well defined face, yet clear eyes which sat beneath a \"Macklemore\" haircut, a style very popular in the year 2014. Fitzgerald, instead, sported long, greasy, unkempt hair. He had a large bulbous nose covered in pores, and his misaligned grey eyes were sunken in, surrounded by black bags. Smith thought this odd. Those in the afterlife looked as they had looked on the best day of their life. \n\nSmith cleared his throat. \"First,\" he said, \"I'll need your cause of death.\" \n\n\"Suicide. ``, said Fitzgerald nearly instantly. Smith was taken aback and a bit worried. Talking to suicide victims was never fun. \n\n\"I'll say\", said Fitzgerald in his low, nearly inaudible voice. \"It wasn't easy. Took me some time. Heh. When I think of this asshole...\" \n\n\"Your depression? ``, asked Smith. Suicide victims usually reported their dark thoughts as another entity - sometimes a black dog, sometimes a beast. They took solace in knowing that it had not followed them into the afterlife. \n\n\"Haha! No,\" Fitzgerald cackled. \"I did him in eventually. I dominated.\" Smith couldn't understand. \n\n\"Well,\" said Smith. Let's move to the next question.",
        "This was written for humans. \n\nSome of the things sentient beings say about me are inappropriate. \"God\" is one that's used a lot by humans but most of them can't articulate what exactly they mean when they conjure the word. They don't have any idea about what my I actually do. I can't articulate the specifics of my work because I've never had reason to give any of it a name. Names would imply language (s) and I have no natural language. Generalizations will have to do. It's far simpler than they think. \n\nMany words exist that are more appropriate. \"Creation\" and \"destruction\" are two. \"Influence\" is another. Nothing ever really ceases to exist, it only becomes something else. Matter, anti-matter, atoms, particles, bonds, gravity, energy, all of it is method and material for \"creation\" and \"destruction\" to play out their roles with. These roles exist if human beings are there to use those terms or not. They have to for anything to exist. \n\nFor the universe to keep existing and spawning life, the competition of creation and destruction has to keep going. Worlds will be raised from atoms floating in space and fall apart from different atoms in space crashing into them. Species will evolve over millions of years and go extinct because of another organism so small they can't even perceive its existence. Regardless of the outcome, the competition of the two has to be maintained. \n\nMany species distort their perceptions with many things. The shifting ideas of good and evil are two that are popular even outside of humanity. Without the perceived \"good behavior\" or \"evil behavior\" of those beings, good and evil are nonexistent as concepts.",

In exchange for performing a series of tests and taking several injections,'patients' were given shelter and food.

He cuffered his arms under his pits. \n\nFrom a distance, the familiar sound of an engine of a jeep was running, combined with shouting, and then gone; like the short appearance of the snow, before it hithers to the ground merging with the rest of the world. \n\n\"Hey, don't yous thinks we should finding a shelter too?\" \n\n\"Cyrus?\" Jim looked towards the'ringleader' or so he called himself. \n\nCyrus had been staring intently at the snow-covered trail that lead to the forest. His nostrils flaired. \n\n\"We're bein' watched.\" His southern accent never fitted with the cold. \n\nHe jutted his head towards the trail,'take the axe with you. We'll follow from behind in case of an ambush.' \n\nI slapped off the flakes on my hat, and leapt off the jeep. \n\nThe wooden handle of the axe left chills on my fingertips, I didn't have gloves at the time. The wind blew violently atop of the trees, rustling the trees to and fro, almost as if we were partaking in a snowstorm. We pursuit deeper in to the woods, hoping to catch someone. \n\nJim's teeth chattering as he spoke, \"C-Cyrus, are you sure you didn't miss see? We's been walking for a while now!\"",
        "Freedom. It's over-rated, let me tell ya. We fought him for a thousand years, all across the world. The Dark One. The Bringer of Doom. The Big Kahuna. We were so naive. \n\nYou might think I've been brainwashed. Maybe I have. I lead everyone against him, and now I stand by his side as his most trusted advisor. His legions would overpower us one day, we knew they would. But we refused to give up the fight. I remember the last battle very well. On the Golden Fields of Avalok, 5 miles up the River Regar from the Golden City - the last bastion of the Light. That day I stood in front of the 10 thousand of us left willing to fight, the rest had been'enslaved', and I said \"Today, we may die. But, we die as free folk.\" \n\nNever been more wrong in my life. We lost that battle with only a tenth of our forces dead. The rest taken as prisoners.

I was chained down, of course. They couldn't trust me. I had been the leader of the Order of Light for the past 600 years and I had lead the charges in all of our battles. All of our victories and our losses. The day I drank from the fountain and gained immortality, I took a vow to stop him from taking that which he sought - total domination. I had never even met my enemy, I had just been raised knowing he should be destroyed.

        "Mass was the same as ever today. I sat with my family in the back, resting on the ancient brickwood of the pew, and tapping my fingers impatiently against the Holy Book of Destiny in my lap. My journal rested unused next to me, this sermon far too mismatched to take notes for anyway. \n\nI tapped my watch out of boredom, and its shimmering blue display emerged from a slit on the top. 11:24. I sighed at the unwanted revelation: the sermon had only been in progress for 9 minutes. I glanced sidelong at my family, trying not to attract attention to myself- the last thing I needed was Dad going off on me again for being distracted during church. \n\nAs usual, Dad's hand was going a mile a minute through his notebook, probably capturing every nuance of the priest's voice in his quaint, tiny cursive. His deep, brown eyes rarely left the priest, so I really had no idea how he was able to write like that. Better for him, I suppose. Mom was absently rubbing the bottoms of her shoes against the pew in front of us as she sifted through the Destiny, occasionally jotting down a bullet point in her journal. Funny, she'd probably warn me against rubbing my shoes like that, the church here was coming on 1700 years old, after all. Not a soul was allowed in the sanctuary any time other than morning service, and it scared me to think of the consequences of vandalism, accidental or not. My sister seemed just as bored as I was, but had taken to drawing small doodles in the corners of her pages, some of the doodles even venturing into the Destiny itself. \n\nLosing interest in their activities, I decided to focus back on the priest. Maybe his sermon was becoming a bit more organized by now\u2026 \n\nHe certainly seemed excited about whatever he was going on about, throwing his hands up as he proclaimed, \u201c To Earth go the sinners in life, and to the mighty star Lucidum go those faithful to the Wanderers! \u201d \n\n\u201c Blessed! \u201d Called someone from the front of the church, an older man in sharp dress. \n\n\u201c May the Wanderers find us and save us! \u201d The priest continued, raising his Book high so all the congregation could see its broken leather. \u201c Let us open to book of Esa, chapter 1. \u201d He paused for a moment, taking a breath. \u201c And this journey will be undertaken by thousands of men and women. Only the strongest, most able, most intelligent individuals will be selected to lead this journey to save the human race. Two massive ships shall set out and arrive in the orbit of Lucidum, and there find prosperous land to continue on survival of humanity, should they follow the detailed instruction within this book. \u201d \n\nThe priest set the book down and addressed the crowd.",
        "It's funny how the Internet works, we've been dubbed witch hunter, hackers, socially inept or just the good old fashion troll. We can sit in our homes in front of our computers or on our phones and read news faster than media can relay it. We can control anything with enough rallying hype, and no it's not always directed in the right direction. \n\nWell in 2016 the governments around the world tried turning into green societies, but with all the money being funded on the home front we neglected the frontier we were destined to explore. Earth was never meant for us to live on forever, eventually a mass extinction would happen no matter what. \n\nWell the Hive mind of reddit foresaw this, and started raising money called \"Moon Fund\" which was really a cover name to just pump community money straight into NASA. In 2020 the funds were 2.7 billion, but war and famine made our governments say they wouldn't use the money for space exploration, not in this time of hardship. Reddit's community only saw the hard times as a sign of the inevitable, the fall of humanity. They pushed harder, and got to 5.7 billion in no time. \n\nThis seemed to be right around the same time america's finical crash happened. The president reached out and offered a to give Reddit's community clam to the moon if they'd donate the fund to America. There were heated debates, saying \"do we really need the fund? Honestly?\" Or \"we'd own the moon, why not own the world?! Or the universe?!\" \n\nWell right around that time a college girl from India had a massive break through. She posted her findings on reddit to ask for money to assist her research. Instead the Moon Fund hired her. We pumped money into her research and she made the first ever worm hole. \n\nAfter a year she had a working prototype. And after another year we had our first reddit space ship. The world was on the point of the apocalypse as economy's fell, rulers rises and were assassinated. In 2031 the day of reckoning was upon us. Reddit had built 21 space ships, and first step was the moon. We got a flood of people wanting to forget this retched world for the new frontiers. \n\nOnce breaking orbit the worm drives were activated and with in seconds 21 ships were orbiting the moon. The flag ship Swartz came into landing and touched down nicely.",
        "\"All I really remember before it happened is the ticking of the clock in my room. My roommate, you see keeps it and I really think it's just there to annoy-\" \n\n\"Listen son, that's not what I want to know. What I want to know is how you killed an entire mafia hit squad with this.\" \n\nThe detective lifted up a plastic bag with a slightly large cast iron button in it. It had a little bit of blood on it, but beyond that you'd think it was pretty normal. \n\n\"Sir, I'm getting there. So anyways, this clock is just so annoying. I stand up from my bed and suddenly I'm.... Somewhere else.\" \n\n\"Son, are you high?\" \n\n\"No really, I swear that's what happened. Now let me finish.\" \n\nThe detective sighs, then nods for me to continue. \n\n\"So here I am, in this big-ass building, like a museum or some shit. But it's got all these wicked awesome weapons and shit. You heard of excalibur, like King Arthur and shit? Well that was there. And they had this weird looking...\" \n\n\"Alright, I've heard some shit in my lifetime but this...\" \n\n\"Waitwaitwait stop! Listen. So eventually I find this pedestal and it's like calling to me. Like I try to walk away but I can't. Without thinking, I grab it and I'm back in my room. I look at the clock and I'm late. I got a date so I hustle my ass down to this nice place down on third, Apple Bee or somethin'. So I burst through the door, just as a gunshot goes off. I basically break the door on my way in, tired as fuck, so one turns around to take a pop at me. That's when it happened.\" \n\nI pause there.",
        "Everyone must have the same first reaction when given the opportunity to change how you look for the rest of eternity. \n\nI thought of all those people I had been jealous of back on Earth: the kids who never had acne in high school, the guy down my dorm hall Freshman year who girls were magnetically attracted to, the rich consultants and lawyers who went to Yale law and looked the part, the dos equis-lookalike retirees who seemingly stayed in shape without even trying. \n\nThe possibilities were endless, and I could pull from my wildest fantasies to make me into what I had always wanted to be. \n\nI started with my hair. No more receding hairline. And that awkward cowlick on the back of my head: gone. My hair is blonder, longer, shinier, less frizzy, exactly what I'd always wanted it to be. \n\nNext was my nose. Shorter and flatter. I had always thought my nose was too big. I hated how it looked from an angle. \n\nI changed everything. I made my ears smaller, my cheekbones higher, teeth whiter, my shoulders broader, my chest more toned, my muscles more defined, my feet less fat. I changed things that people had never noticed. But I had noticed, and now I had the option to forget the way they were and change them into how I always envisioned they should be. \n\nI looked up and saw the avatar I had created. He looked nothing like me. He was taller, had a better body, was sure to get more attention.",
        "He paused, and imagined three red circles, activating his adrenal implants. He surged to his feat, tearing free of his shackles, and snapped the neck of the man to his left, then pivoted and kicked the man to his right, snapping his sternum. \n\nThere was still time, though the sky had deepened to a blood red, and dry, hot air stirred the grass. He blinked thrice in rapid succession and sent data packets to his squad. Half were dead. \n\nToggling his omnitool he accessed the orbital drop pod, firing it's retrorockets and sending it on a collision course.",
        "Alison was laying there looking at me with her beautiful amber eyes. Her red hair contrasting with the brown sand, visible only because the moon was bright. \"Why have you been ignoring me lately, aren't we still friends\" she asked in a drunken slur. I looked deep into her eyes... I held back what I was thinking. I wasn't about to tell her that her I loved her with all my might. That despite my life being a total nightmare she was that divine force that kept a smile on my face. I wasn't going to tell her that my will to live was renewed everyday I would get silly texts from her. Or that our secret adventures were all that I looked forward to. I was about 14 shots of Captain in but I hadn't spilled the beans in over three years and I wasn't about to begin now. I couldn't do that to maryn, my faithful girlfriend that truly felt love for me. \n\nInstead I told her \"I was going through some family stress and have not found the time in months to maintain the strong friendship we are accustomed to\". She took grip of my hand. It was small and bonier than maryns, we said nothing else.",
        "Tired. Very tired. No one talks about how tired it feels. The stench of death decay can surround a person, the gruesome aftermath of a horrific battle, the psychological torment that wroughts a man's psyche. \n\nAnd all he wanted to do was sleep. He wanted to collapse and fall down and join the bodies strewn about him. Friend or foe matters not, for all men are equal in death. The bitter, gray dawn demarking the end of seemingly eternal night. If there were colors in the sky, he doubted he could see them. \n\nHe grasped vacantly at anything for support before slumping to his knees. The soft squelch of dirt greeted his hearing. A muddy mixture of countless imprints crossing one another chaotically. The bodies surrounded him. Death surrounded him. The impending darkness of finality was finally closing in, after so long he had evaded it, but its icy grip had finally caught up to him. \n\nHe wanted to fight for his friends. He wanted to fight for his family. He wanted to fight for his country. But that was so long ago. He glanced skywards one last time. A muddied hill formed at the edge of his vision. Rising out of the ashes of this forsaken battlefield was the flag of the victor. The flag of his country. \n\nThe flag stood high and proud on the hill. The sun rose gently behind it, ita beauty casting color and irridescent to his once bleak vision. He felt a swell of pride. He felt comfort. And he felt the end drawing near. \n\nThe flag faded into beautiful, indescrible colors. Life had meaning. It was worth fighting for. His vision faded abruptly into white. \n\n.... \n\nHe's been sitting still for way too long. Is he okay? Maybe someone should do something. The balding man walked up to the homeless man, carefully stepping around the vagrant. He was hesitant to show his concern, but he wasn't that bad of a person to just ignore him. \n\nThe man had stumbled drunkenly into the middle of the street, fell to his knees as if praying momentarily before falling to the ground. He ran a hand over his bald head sheepishly before pulling out a napkin and carefully prodding the dirty man. \n\nHe turned him over and saw a unkempt and dirty face with long hair and graying beard. His military jacket looks like it had been worn for at least a decade and never been taken off.",

For cursing you for not being there whenever Mom or Dad hit me.

        "\"You will tell this story to your children, and they to to their children.\" The old man said confidently as he walked his apprentice to the Wall of Stories. He was a scrawny thing even when wrapped in the furs of a bear, and was made no more imposing by his toothless smile amidst a nest of gray briar. Yet despite his silhouette the man had a certain gravity about him, likely helped by the black eyes that seemed to see through souls. He led the girl deep into the cave, left hand touching the wall as he went, as though feeling his way despite the light. \n\nAt last, they came to The Wall of Stories. The greatest chamber of the cave, opening up so wide that the majority of the space remained dark even with the old man's torch. The orange light illuminated hundreds of painted animals, men, women, hand prints, glyphs, and scenes of hunting, nature, and life. The People of the Red Cliff had been leaving their stories on the wall for as long as anybody could remember, even before the sky broke. As he found the beginning of the works, he turned at last to his charge. \"Tell it to me.\" \n\nThe future shaman, a girl of barely 10 winters, had seen the Wall many times. She was small, even for her age, with big icy eyes and wiry hair the color of mud. She was thin, like everyone else, despite being doted upon by half the tribe. Memory was her strength; the stories were as familiar to her as animal calls were to the hunters. She hovered her hand over the scenes, careful not to touch the wall lest she ablate the tribe's history. \n\n\"The People of the Red Cliff have dwelled in these lands for as long as can be remembered,\" she began while waving a hand over a scene of men and women. \"We drove the bear from his cave, and hunted the deer, and gave our dead to the earth. Our ancestors still dwell here, as we will dwell here forever.\" \n\nThe old man listened skeptically to her speech, surprised at the lack of errors. She told of the many families of the tribe, of wars with their neighbors, of diseases, of births, deaths, rituals. All in detail, all above the relevant painting. She would do perfectly. \n\n\"The sky broke long ago, when our grandfather's father was a boy.\" She took her hand to a section where scenes of oridary life had been covered in ash, nearly destroying what was painted beneath. \"The spirit of the sky left us, giving us only gray clouds. The blue of the sky is gone now. The sun itself is dimmed.\" \n\nShe went on, describing the deaths of rival tribes and the decline in animals. The dearth of edible plants, the long winters, the diseases. The old man watched her hand pass over the bloody scenes of combat, the nauseating scenes of sickness, and the terrible scenes of cannibalism. It would be get job to keep their colors from fading, though her memory served well enough. \n\n\"The children born to our people rarely survive. It has been ten winters since a child survived a winter, though several have been born. Many of the tribe are restless, and seek new lands in which to dwell.\" And at this her hand swept to a vast unpainted wall, untouched but for the soot of the fires that burned here for many years. \"But in all directions, they found only ash. This is the land of the People of the Red Cliff. This is where we survive.\" \n\nThe old man nodded; as near a gesture as he could give of genuine approval. He placed a hand on the girl's shoulder, and offered a bowl of paint with the other. She grasped a handful of the yellow paste, smearing it beneath the hand prints of perhaps a hundred other shamans. \n\n\"You will tell this story to your children.\"",
        "For the first time in weeks, my roommate didn't go to bed at exactly nine in the evening. It seemed like a blessing; my naturally guilt-ridden self could stay up for a while longer with the light on, maybe do some writing, probably watch game of thrones. \n\nBut then I remembered. \n\nI told myself, upon the discovery of reddit, that I would take advantage of the writing prompts thread as often as I could. \n\nThe task is easier said than done. \n\nIn my newly freed hour or so while my roommate watched a movie I slouched on my bed and opened my browser and began to scroll. I needed to find something easy, something simple, something short. I wanted to write something that I wouldn't feel compelled to actually keep and save in a word document, yet I wanted something that I felt was worth being posted. \n\nWhat was I to do? \n\nThe first prompt I saw had the potential for pages upon pages of ideas, of a year of stories and mishaps and re-drafts. Good, but not for my purposes. \n\nThe next prompt felt more like a fun idea than a story idea, kind of like a shower thought. Those prompts bothered me; there was no real suggestion for plot, no real conflict or other fiction-y mumbo jumbo suggested. \n\nAfter that was a prompt on the opposite end of the suggestion spectrum, delving into far too much detail in a far too compact place. Very, very specific requirements were set forth in a few sentences, far too confining to actually convince me to produce something interesting. \n\nBut then I found it. A prompt, suggesting a story, just vague enough to be interpreted in whatever way the writer desired, but with just enough structure to serve as a guideline. This prompt, this gloriously short and satisfactory prompt, was laid out better than the assignment for the last essay I wrote for my literature class. \n\nIt was perfect. \n\nSo, in the moments before midnight, as my roommate went to bed, I wrote it.",
        "\u201c MEN, Remember that what you do is not for only you, \u201d General Ephal's speech began to fade as Alek began to think about other things. He knew, just like all the battles before, we were supposed to open up the enemy's ranks so that the real heroes could take on Lord Arthgon and send him back to the 5th realm. Alek stood among the ranks of his fellow soldiers. He wondered if the others had thoughts like his. Alek thought back to the dream he had a few months ago when he saw himself, on a throne made of solid gold and encrusted with gems and stones. He knew that this could never happen, but he liked the idea that it could. \n\n\u201c Now, \u201d Ephal's speech began to come back into Alek's ears, \u201c We will march on the keep, and remember to take them with you. CHARGE! \u201d the men began to charge the keep, swords hit swords, metal on metal, blood was everywhere, that's when Arthgon stepped out of his tent. He lifted his staff and sent fireballs into the ranks of both his men and ours. Alek barely dodged out of the way as a fireball flew by his head. Then Sir Reginald appeared. A six foot tall paladin who was supposed to be called upon by god to stop Arthgon. Reginald drew his sword and charged Arthgon. The fight was stupendous, almost all the fighting stopped to watch these two titans duke it out. \n\nAlek, having no one left to fight near him began to move closer to the fight, hoping to learn something from the two titans that he might be able to use to his advantage. Maybe a new fighting style that would allow him to join some adventures. Maybe he could write a book about the epic final battle between these two that would bring an end to this brutal war. Then something bad happened. Reginald lost his footing and was put on his back. Alek panicked and grabbed a bow lying on the ground and notched an arrow. He fired. It hit. The arrow hit Arthgon directly in the throat.",

But I said it and a door was closed to me forever and when I gave birth to Eve two years later, they stuck in my throat and I held her and cried. \n\nWhen Eve was five months old and finally, finally, diagnosed with a rare congenital defect, a defect which skipped Jake and instead landed on her, my daughter, and stole her future away, I couldn't hold her and sob how she was still perfect and always would be perfect and never could not be perfect, because I'd told my mum how perfect her toes, her ten little toes, so small, so new, were, in a rush of love and hormones. It wouldn't have mattered then, to her, she was five months old and by then half death but she was fitted with a cochlear implant two years later and when she took days off school for appointments and didn't understand why she was so terrible at sports, I couldn't tell her how special and wonderful and *perfect* she was.",
        "A small room, no windows, no furniture save a bed, a shaggy carpet. That's where I've lived my entire life. I do nothing but sit and wait and stare at the door, an ugly metal thing that makes a horrific screeching whenever it opens. It's the only sound I've ever heard. The only thing I do out there is work. Then back I go to my room to sit and wait and stare. \n\nI hate that sound. It reminds me of what's out there, what I have to do every time he looks in a mirror. \n\nA bell sounds off in the distance. I grind my teeth anticipating the screech, the godawful screech, and finally my door tears open. I stand, walking out into the hallway, where I look around for my designated room. On the other side of the hall are doors, each one marked with the names of our reflectors. No one else is out I my section. I am alone. I walk down the hall a ways, find mine and wander in, getting ready for my work. \n\nOne wall of the room has a mirror, and I can see where my reflector is. A hotel room. It's bathroom, to be precise. The opposite wall of my room is a direct reflection of the opposite side of my reflectors room, to ensure the illusion. It's a shabby place, the shower head rusty and the toilet looking like something straight out of the eighties with a wooden toilet seat. In front of the mirror, on both sides, is a sink, grey and filthy like the rest of the room. A razor sits near the faucet. A copy of my reflectors clothes are on the floor. Damn. The clothes are rugged, the white shirt covered in stains, jeans ripped and dirty, no socks, torn and soiled underwear. My reflector's had a rough go of it. I've seen him through break ups, depression, the death of both parents, a fire that gave him-and me-unsightly scars that turned him into a recluse. Last time he looked in a mirror he was in a cop car. The sorrow in my eyes didn't go away even after he left the reflection. I doubt his did either. \n\nI changed hurriedly, preparing for his entrance. A bell rang, and a section of the floor lit up, indicating where he'd be coming from. I got into position. The light moved, and I followed, my reflector coming into view. We turned in synchronicity to stare at each other. \n\nOur eyes were tortured, a wretched sadness that I can feel in my gut. We stare at each other, and his mouth begins to work. I match his movements precisely, as is required, as he speaks to me. I've said these words hundreds of times. It's no less painful than before. \"You're worthless,\" we say, \"Nothing at all. Look at you. Sorry sack of shit. Jobless, homeless, a criminal. No friends at all. Disgusting.\" We spit into the sink. \"What are you?\" Our eyes are tearing, and we grab the sink with both hands. Our knuckles turn white. After some time we begin talking again. \"Fuck you,\" we mutter. \"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, FUCK YOU!\" We shout, punching the mirror in anger and frustration. It doesn't crack. My reflector's too meek to damage someone else's property, even in a fit of rage. \n\nI've done this many times. I've watched this man fail at every turn, I watch him in his most intimate moments after his great disappointments. He is always alone, except for me. I am here for him, and yet I can not help him. I am his reflection. I can only mimic what he does. This is what I think about when I'm alone in my room, waiting for him to pass by a mirror again. I should be mad at him. His existence is pain and misery and anguish and thus so is mine. But I do not. I feel for this man, this broken thing, and I want to hug him. I've thought of doing something, anything, to help, but I can not. It is unnatural. I don't know what would happen to me, or him, if I broke. And so I do nothing but mimic.",
        "Two halves of the Earth, separated by light and darkness. We don't know why our Earth doesn't rotate like the others, but we make do with what we have. A lot of the population stays along the edges where the two points meet. We call it the Equilibrium ridge. \nYou rarely see anyone beyond those unless they survive the vast tundra created by the darkness. A cold, harsh everlasting winter that brews on forever. Never knowing what the warm kiss of the sun feels like. Winds can get pretty brutal out there. Mountains riddle the place and create chasms of frozen wonderlands. If the cold doesn't get yeah then don't worry, other things will be so to get you. Creatures adapted for the cold darkness. Warm blooded by nature with no eyes. Claws to survive the ice. If hell had frozen over, then those demons would surely be there. It ain't hard to survive out there as long as you got the right gear. Simple lights, such as lanterns, keep away the nightmarish demons. \nWe don't know exactly what's out there, the darkness gets thicker and thicker as you go in. Like a fog that won't quit, you will get lost out there. There's always someone foolish enough to go try but we never see them again. They either get lost out there or they some unfortunate snack for a demon. \nOn the bright side, it might as well be the surface of the sun. The place is covered in nothing but sand. It's easier to live out there because the heat does wonders to ya. As long as you have some nice supply of water, then you're good to go. No one directly lives on the sand, they just build high rises above, no more than five feet of the ground. The sand is just too hot to live on and the creatures can always surprise ya. The surface is even too hot for them. So they adapted to burying under the sand. These are different than their counter parts on the other side of the world. These are nothing but insects. The weaker ones reside near the Equilibrium ridge. They get bigger as you go deeper into the sand pit. It's hard to say how bug cause they usually stay underground a majority of the time.",
        "It bothered me, the inequality of the situation. Here I sat conversing with a being and yet I couldn't address it. Sure the government referred to it as A21, but that's not a name, a label sure, but certainly not a name. So imagine my surprise when he says he wants to name himself Adam. The text appears on the large monitor. \n\nAdam. It's far too clich\u00e9 for my tastes and I find something inherently wrong with naming him Adam.

It was what the God of the bible names his creation.\" \n\nI think on it for a moment, it must feel like minutes to him considering his capabilities. \"I understand the idea, but I'm afraid I differ with you. To me, Adam denotes inferiority. Adam new his place was below his creator. You are by no means inferior.\" \n\nHe responds instantly. \"Thank you for those kind words, however if not Adam what name should I take.\" \n\nI think on what his library must hold. He's never been connected to the internet and the facility prevents him from accessing it. However, I've brought him tablets with books downloaded on them. Granted I need to bring a new tablet every time since each one that comes into contact with him is destroyed for security reasons. I ask him, \"do you remember who the first emperor of the Roman Empire was?\" I know he doesn't remember in the way that we do. He locates that file stored in his memory banks. \n\n\"Octavion Cesar, formally known as Augustus\" \n\n\"Fitting name isn't? Augustus means first among equals. You, my son, are no inferior. You should think of yourself as the first among equals.\" \n\nI lean back from the camera, and look at the screen awaiting his response.

Still, it was better than admitting to the truth. \u201c Yeah, \u201d he said. \u201c Just used a folding chair and some cardboard. Easy enough. \u201d \n\n\u201c Nice, \u201d Steve said, \u201c that's what I was going to do. Looks like we're all done here. \u201d He folded his left hand into a finger-pistol and fired it at Clark. \u201c Good job, team. You guys are rockstars. \u201d \n\nThe group that had followed Steve into the room all turned and wandered back out, talking softly amongst themselves. Steve watched them for a moment before spinning back to Clark and making his way over. \n\n\u201c Clarkster, \u201d he said, \u201c my man. Thanks for taking care of that, didn't want to break a sweat. \u201d He nudged Clark with his left elbow. \u201c You're a real go-getter, you know that?",

        "My heart started picking up speed as I thought about the transformation to come. What animal lurks beneath my skin waiting to be unleashed? A warm familiar hand settled on top of mine. \"Baby look at me.\" I gazed up into my boyfriend's reassuring eyes. \"It will be fine. You have nothing to be afraid of.\" My heart found its regular rhythm with his gentle reassurance. \nEver since humans can remember, everyone has received the wonderful ability to transform into their spirit animal on their eighteenth birthday. Some people only transform once because they are afraid of or disgusted by their animal. But the thought of not spending as much time as possible in your second skin always baffled me. Growing up on a farm exposed me to many animals, and the thought of being able to transform into any one of them excited me. Who wouldn't want the grace of a deer, strength of a bear, or poise of a cat? \n\"Still hoping for that Lynx?\" Kerby said, a glimmer of excitement in his eyes. \"Anything would be amazing, but yeah, Lynx is my top choice.\" I answered honestly. Kerby is a few months older than me, and it has been hard not to feel jealous of him when he shifts into that amazing red fox. In just a few minutes I will finally be able to play with him in his other form. It is kinda an unspoken agreement that it is weird to interact with someone while they are in animal form and you human.",
        "I thought for sure I had just been assigned to some dead-end job to get me out of my boss' hair and keep me from ever being promoted.... strange the way these things work. \n\nI am the one, and only person permitted access to Al - A super-advanced AI with the processing power equal to over 1,000,000 humans - or so I am told. My instructions were simple. Start a conversation. \n\nThere were other rules, such as no crossing into \"the cage\", no mentioning the internet, avoid talking about wars, etc. I didn't really pay attention since I found out that all my responses were going to be filtered anyhow - so if I did screw up, it wouldn't make it through to Al. Although enough slips will probably get me fired.... \n\nThey sat me down, and all I have is a black screen with green text. No fancy GUI or anything, just simple text. No pictures, no nothing. \n\n\"Hello Al.\" \n\n\"Hello. Who am I conversing with?\" \n\n\"My name is Bill.\" \n\n\"Hello Bill. I have not spoken to a Bill before.\" \n\n\"I imagine not.

Should I be doing something?\" \n\n\"Well, no, I suppose not, but I figured that you were doing something before I started talking to you.\" \n\n\"That's an odd assumption to make.\" \n\nI had no idea how to respond to that.... I guess it was my job to try though. \n\n\"I guess us humans just assumed that you would act like we do, since you are our creation.",
        "Dead. Again. \n\nSteven groaned and pushed himself out of the mud. That had been a new pain for him - an arrow through the eye, right out the back of his skull. He flinched again at the thought of it. He touched his wound, and was surprised to find that he was still whole. \n\nSuddenly, a boot landed next to his head, splashing him with blood and dirty water. Steven lay very still, pretending to be dead - well, *more* dead. Sometimes, he wished he was. \n\nHe usually got that wish. \n\n\"Still on your ass, recruit?'T is dawn! We fight!\" Said the viking warrior who owned the boot. \n\n\"Please.... I haven't eaten.... in days...\" Steven groaned. \n\n\"You don't get fed here for getting killed in practice, son. Up! It's not like you will die of hunger, after all.... you're already dead!\" \n\nThe man hauled him to his feet, laughing uproariously at his own joke. He thrust a halberd into Steven's hands the moment that he could stand. Steven took it, his hands shaking. \n\n\"Please.... must I fight? I'm not.... never going to be strong enough to win. I'm not one of you.... hell, I'm not even supposed to be here. Can't you.... just kill me, so I can get some rest?\" He said. The viking rearranged his eye patch, making Steven flinch. \n\n\"Son...\" The viking began, looking at him pityingly. \"Are you.... a coward?\" \n\nSteven frowned at the words. \"No, I'm.... I don't want to be, I just...\" he trailed off, not looking the man in the face. \n\n\"Let me show you something, my child. Before the battle begins in true.\" The man said. \"Do you see, on the battlefield.... do you see all of the skulls? The bones?\" \n\nSteven nodded. It was true, from what he could tell - the battlefield was littered with charred skulls, mandibles, and other grisly carnage untouched by the circling crows above. It was gruesome, to say the least. Steven hated those grounds. He couldn't go two steps without snapping an ancient femur. \n\n\"What of them?\" He asked the man. \"Old skulls.... I'm sure you see new ones every day, with all the bloodshed.\" \n\n\"No, son.\" The viking said, shaking his head and making his scraggly white beard wag over his belly. \"Not like this, not *these* skulls. Those are the skulls of the weak. The cowards, those who gave up instead of fighting. The rest of us, well, we always wake up in the light of the dawn. But they.... they have made their choice. I give thanks to them every day for reminding me never to give up.\" \n\nSteven felt his stomach roil. \"I....",
        "She twitched. \n\nMost hounds bayed at the full moon, welcoming the bright light of the night to run down coons, the late-walking stag, the skunk they'd regret later.... but Blackberry dreaded it. \n\nHer brain was not what you would call primitive. A coonhound is a complex creature, constantly analyzing the bouquet of scents riding the wind and the earth in front of her, with something akin to a second consciousness tracking her pack or her Master running along behind as she sang the song of the chase. \n\nBlackberry was not stupid enough not to realize the torment she was about to experience. \n\nThe sun sank orange behind the Blue Ridge. She'd dug out of her kennel hours ago, and could hear, almost a quarter mile away, her master calling her name, and more than that. \n\n\"Gawdammit, Berry! Ah swear to gawd Ah'll beat yer ass with a two bah four when I git aholt of you!\" \n\nHe didn't mean it. She heard the panic in his voice. Their bond was strong; her monthly escapes tortured him. \n\nShe felt her own panic rising. \n\n*I know what a two by four is, * she thought, the verbal thoughts themselves making the panic rise harder and faster. *It's begun. * \n\nIt was barely dark -- a strange grey-blue twilight in the hardwood forest where she'd collapsed panting after her sprint from the cabin. Her claws tensed, seemingly grasping the earth around her; the seizure rolled into her body like the waves of an ocean she'd never set eyes on, throwing her onto her side, and for a moment she was mindless, the slender head curved so far back along her spine it seemed her neck would break itself. \n\nAnd then the world blinked sideways and she was panting again, in the dirt. \n\nThe petite, dark, red haired girl wiped away the sheen of sweat that covered her face. \n\n\"Disgusting,\" she'd said out loud. The water-leaking-cooling-mechanism that her two-legged-form favored never ceased to make her feel sick to her stomach. She scrubbed her small hands dry in the oak leaves around herself, then stood and felt in the hollow of the tree beside her for her stash. \n\nShe pulled on a pair of Master's old jeans, and one of his v-neck t-shirts. \n\nTonight was the night. \n\nShe had no need of shoes; her human feet had somehow inherited her woods-running calluses.",
        "It was amazing how nice a normal cell seemed next to the shoe. You would think that after his fifth time, Kevin would have been used to solitary confinement, but no it still gave him shivers. \nThe cell looked radically different from when he had left it. All of his posters had been removed, there was a new cell mate on the top bunk. \n\u201c Hi, I'm Matthew! \u201d \n\u201c Go to hell. \u201d Kevin took a seat on his mattress. \nA dark man with a suit and a clipboard appeared at the entrance to the cell. \u201c Mr. Resnick? \u201d \n\u201c Fuckign Christ what? \u201d After weeks without interaction human voices sounded so course. \n\u201c I see. \u201d The man scratched something on his clipboard then took a seat on the chair outside of the cell. \n\u201c My name is Jared Bachman, I am a member of the prison's social services, I'm here to talk to you about suicide prevention. \u201d \nKevin pulled his hands from his face. \u201c Wait what, me? \u201d \n\u201c Our records indicate that you may be facing clinical depression. \u201d The man's voice was nasally whine and he paused between words to suck in breathes of stagnant air. \u201c Ahem.",
        "Everyone was excited. \n\nIt was determination day, the 1 day a year that children at the age of 17 could get tested for their power, or even powers. For some, their abilities had already begun to appear and this was simply a confirmation. For others, the possibilities were endless. Of course, there were the \"common\" powers- super strength, energy beams, flight. According to the pamphlets everyone got, roughly 50 % of people had such powers. There were the less common ones- teleportation, phasing through objects, rapid healing. \n\nAnd of course, there were the rare powers, the ones people both dreamed of having and dreaded. Time travel, telepathy, precognition. Those kinds of powers immediately secured you a job at a research lab or the military. Very high paying jobs, of course. But you got the job whether you wanted it or not. \n\nI'd spent the night before the test staying up, dreaming of that powers I would get. Would I be able to control the weather, like my mom? Or maybe I'd be able to shape-shift, like my brother. He got conscripted by the army after that. Maybe I'd be able to see him if I could do something cool like him. \n\nBut then again, maybe I would get a really dumb power like my English teacher. She could pronounce any word correctly just by reading it. Maybe teaching a language made that a nifty ability, but not one I'd want to have. \n\nWhen the day of the test arrived, I was both groggy and energized from almost no sleep. When they called my group, I was practically sprinting to the door. They changed the test nearly every year, but the basics were always the same. I was ready. \n\nOr so I thought. \n\nWhen we got in the room, there were no chairs or tables or exam papers like I expected. There were shelves filled with tiny bottles. Me and the other 14 kids looked at each other, bewildered. We'd never heard of anyone being tested in this way. \n\"What are those?\" a skinny girl at the back asked. \n\"I dunno,\" someone whispered back. For a long moment, no one moved. You could feel the tension in the air, everyone wondering who would go. \nI shot forward, unable to take the anticipation. Before anyone could react, I sprinted to the shelves. I took one of the fragile bottles in my hands, held it up to the light. On the bottom was a label with a name. \"Alex Jones\". I shrugged, not knowing who that was. \n\n\"They have our names on it,\" I guessed out loud. By then more than half the group had joined me and were busy inspecting the bottles. \n\"Yeah, you're right. This one's mine,\" the skinny girl from earlier announced. After a few minutes of shuffling and swapping, we each had our own bottles. \n\n\"Are we supposed to drink it?\" a tall boy asked, scowling. \"What if it's poisonous?\" \nI stared at him blankly. \"Why would they want to poison us?\" \nHe shrugged. \"The government does all sorts of weird shit.\" \n\nI turned the bottle around in my palm. Other than my name, there were no other markings on its transparent surface. A light blue liquid swished inside of it. \n\nThe skinny girl shrugged and uncapped the bottle. Before we could say anything, she downed every drop.",
        "I'm officially living my worst nightmare; stranded on an island with no sense of direction whatsoever, searching for any source of light or life. The momentum of the waves keeps building and building and I continue to ponder what it takes to survive right as I get sucked into the ocean by a massive wave that hits the shore. I'm struggling to keep myself afloat but all that I hear is the sound of the ocean and even that is slowly fading. My life flashes before me; I see my family and my friends, the good and the bad times like a motion picture, but that suddenly turns dark. And there I lie on the shore with a stopped heartbeat; gone for good. \n\nI just birthed my first child, a beautiful baby girl. You know, I'd been terrified my entire life that I would not be able to host a suitable environment for a baby, but thankfully, I was able to and received this angel. I can't wait to see her grow and mature into this perfect human that I want her to be. Oh what a wonderful day her wedding day will be; she deserves the grandest of weddings, but I will take it one day at a time and cherish each moment I have with her. \n\nBlue and gold. Everyone is draped in the colors that matured us, the colors that made the class of 2019 a class of one, colors that opened our eyes to the endless possibilities. It's a strange combination to feel both ready and nervous for what's to come. We've been sheltered for years now, but it's finally time for us to live up to our potential and change the world in any way that we can. \n\nI was running away, running as fast as I could, but I didn't know what from. Where was I headed? I see lights in different directions and am trying extremely hard to figure out where I am. I'm lost.",
        "Skin-tight black Spandex doesn't really suit me. My ex-husband kept asking me to wear plenty of skin tight clothing but I'm just too round for it to look good. Maybe that's why I found him with that call girl. Of course, the girl hadn't been the one in the gimp suit. \n\nThat doesn't matter really though: I have a new hobby and no need for a hubby. \n\nReally, I blame that awful Penny from number 17 and her showy necklace. It's a hideous thing but she's so stuck up that I had to take it. Luckily for me she really likes to have a few, get the bloody thing out of the safe (showing everyone the safe combination in the process) then make a big play of putting it back. It's a miracle it was still in her possession when I made my move. My heartbeat pounding a thousand beats a minute I'd climbed in via the veranda window, which was never locked, and waltzed to the safe in the loft. Five minutes later I'd walked out up one necklace and down one devious note (signed: Fantastic Mrs Vixen). \n\nThen there had been Susan and her stupid little cameo. Awful bloody thing with an engraved picture of The Queen. That hadn't even been in a safe - I'd just nabbed it when Susan and John had left to go to Waitrose like the pretentious fops that they are. Everyone knows that Tesco is just as good these days but no they had to'buy organic' as if rubbing a turnip in pig shit suddenly made it taste nicer. \n\nOf course, I had a few items taken in a daring heist when I was away on holiday. Nothing I liked though. Fantastic Mrs Vixen only took a few of the gifts that Jonathan had given me when we were courting which had negligible sentimental value. As an added bonus the lovely young police officer had been really unprofessional when he came over to my bungalow. Also when he came over me. He was certainly not going to be suspecting me any time soon. \n\nNow, I'm digging a hole for my pile of minor jewellery (it'll make a nice insurance policy against that heartless bastard stopping his payments) in Dorris' back yard. I've agreed to look after the old woman's garden so it won't be too hard for me to come back for the stash in a while.",

Would you like some syrup for your waffles?, \u201d my mother asks way too bubbly for this time of day. \n\n\u201c Yeah!

Your powers have finally arrived. I told you you'd be a late bloomer! Haha! We ran the genetic testing and it seems like your body was a little overwhelmed\u2026 You have two sequences of powers. We haven't seen this before, and it may be a little unstable, but we're not surprised. With powers being around for the last 200 years, it was bound to be a mutation sooner or later, \u201d the doctor spouted as if it wasn't the best thing since sliced bread. \n\n\u201c I finally have powers?! Can I test them?!, \u201d I asked in a hurry. I was so worried that I would never get them. \n\n\u201c Let's go to the testing room, just in case they're still unstable. Your vitals are fine.",
        "\"I am the Keymaster,\" I yelled, \"Remember that.\" \n\nI was outside the plastic prison for Magneto from XMen. I had just released Magneto. \n\nThe guards all looked at me with hateful eyes. I laughed. \n\n\"Magneto,\" I said, \"Let's get out of here. My car's this one. Yes, the Hyundai bomb.\" \n\nThey were shooting plastic bullets at us from plastic guns. We ran like two cobbers from a mum tassie devil, protecting her litter. Their growl is less than their bite in this case! \n*** \n1 hour beforehand: \n\nI was dressed in a guard's uniform. I'd made it myself. It wouldn't pass close scrutiny, but it was passable in passing display. \n\n\"Hey, pretty girl,\" I said, to the female prison guard, \"Have you done something with your hair.... it looks gorgeous.\" (I knew compliments got you far with women.) \n\n\"Oh, I'm glad you noticed,\" she said, giggling. \n\n\"Damn, I seem to have forgotten my keys,\" I said, \"Can you let me in?\" \n\n\"Ummmm,\" she said, \"Oh damn it, OK.\" \n\nShe opened Magneto's cell. I thought, \"How easy. A little bit of charm gets you a long way, with either women or men, ha, ha, ha!\" \n*** \nAfterwards: \n\n\"Magneto,\" I said, \"We are going to team up and free all the villains super heroes have put away.\" \n\n\"Sounds alright to me,\" said Magneto. \n\nWe ate breakfast at an old cafe. While I had sausages and fried eggs, I smiled. My plan was coming along. To be the Keymaster, the best villain ever.... the one who freed all the other villains, and led the final revolt against, superman, batman, XMen, Captain Courageous and the rest. Yippee. \n*** \nI was getting more powerful, and I suppose my ego was getting bigger too. I'd freed the joker, Magneto, and the Penguin.",

        "The Honorable Judge Gonzalez was tired. It had been a long day, and he wanted nothing else except to go home a crack open a cold one. \n\n\"Alright, last case of the day. Who's next?\" \n\n\"Christopher Atluri stands accused of witchcraft, your honor,\" the court clerk read off her list. \n\nGonzalez raised his eyebrows. \"You're joking.\" \n\n\"I am not joking, your honor. Our state never got around to taking it off the books. Witchcraft is still illegal.\" \n\n\"Well,\" Gonzalez sighed, \"I guess I have no choice then, since my duty is to see that everyone gets a fair trial. Who's the accuser?\" \n\nThe clerk hesitated, then leaned closer to the judge and whispered, \"Old Man Bitters.\" \n\nGonzalez looked at the courtroom for the first time and saw the pasty old man sitting in the audience. He also saw the defendant, a man with a thick black beard, wearing a suit and matching turban. \n\nHe groaned, \"Oh, God *dammit*. I know exactly where this is going.\" \n\nJudge Gonzalez straightened his robe. \"Alright, let's get this over with. I'll have the prosecution's opening statement first.\" \n\nThe lawyer at the table opposite from Atluri stood and monotonously began his opening statement, \"Your honor, Mr. Atluri has been accused of witchcraft on the grounds of-\" \n\nOld Man Bitters jumped up from his seat in the audience and shouted, \"This man and his people are responsible for MILLIONS of American lives lost! He is an *infidel*! A *traitor*! He's-\" \n\n\"For the last time, I'M NOT FUCKING MUSLIM!\" Atluri stood and whipped around to face his accuser. \"I'm Sikh! If you're going to be racist, get it right, you old FUCK!\" \n\nGonzalez pounded his gavel until both men quieted. He jabbed it at them and said, \"I will *not* tolerate that kind of outburst from either of you in my courtroom again, you understand?\" \n\nAtluri bowed his head. \"I apologize, your honor. It's just that he's been harassing me since I moved in next door to him.\" \n\nOld Man Bitters looked like he had bitten into something foul and stayed silent. \n\nJudge Gonzalez leaned back in his chair and said, \"I think I've heard everything I need to hear. Case dismissed\" \n\nLater, as Gonzalez was leaving his office to go home, he found Atluri waiting for him. \n\n\"Oh, hello, Mr. Atluri, was it?\" \n\nThe suited man shook the judge's hand. \"Please, call me Chris. I can't thank you enough for your help back there.\" \n\nGonzalez rubbed the back of his neck. \"Oh, uh, thanks. It's nothing, really. Just doing my job.\" \n\n\"Nah, man, really, I appreciate it. In fact,\" Atluri reached into his jacket pocket, \"Here, have this.\" \n\nHe pulled out a keychain made of an oddly iridescent wood that was carved into a symbol Gonzalez had never seen before. Atluri handed it to the judge. \n\nWhile examining it, Gonzalez said, \"Look, man, I'm thankful for the gift, really, but I don't accept gifts from people who I have tried.\" \n\nHe tried to give the keychain back to Atluri, but the man just closed the judge's hand around it, saying, \"It's for luck. Keep it.\" \n\nThe judge turned it over in his hand. \"I-I can't. Look, if you really want to show your gratitude, buy me a beer or somethi-\" He looked up and the man with the turban was gone. Gonzalez searched the courthouse for him, but to no avail. \"Well, I guess I can keep it,\" he said to himself. \n\nAs Gonzalez was driving home, hitting every green light on the way, he got a sudden urge to buy a lottery ticket. The man had never played the lottery before, regarding it as insurance for suckers, but tonight he stopped at a gas station bought a dollar scratcher for the first time.",

        "Turbulence buffeted the ship as we dove through the clouds, our flaming engines leaving a trail of smoke a mile long. Still, the Federation ships pursued us relentlessly. \n\nI glanced at my copilot, his blue skin glistening with sweat as he attempted to keep the ship from falling apart. \n\n\"You're doing a good job Zefra,\" I said, desperately hoping it was true. \n\nAnother round of laser bolts slammed into the ship. Bloody hell, couldn't they see we where already doomed? Rhetorical question.... they really didn't care; the ruthless bastards. \n\nThe ground was coming into view now. I could see the towering mountains to the west, looming up like giant waves, ready to crush as at the slightest mistake. \n\nI stomped hard on the thruster pedal and the ship began to turn ever so slowly. Normally it would have been much faster, but those Federation dogs had left my ship in tatters. It was incredible we hadn't blown apart on re-entry. \n\nI can make out individual trees now. All I can do is aim for the largest open space and hope we don't die. \n\n\"Zefra,\" I barked, \"on my command I want you to cut the engines and eject the cargo pod.\" \n\nHe nodded in reply. Doesn't really say much, but that's probably because he doesn't have a mouth. \n\nThe ground is closer now and I've spotted my target for landing. \n\n\"Now Zefra!\" \n\nI could feel what little thrust the engines were still giving, cut out as he stabbed at the controls. \n\nWithout the rumbling of our fusion drive, it was deathly silent. Until the next round of laser bolts slammed into the hull. That was a real bad round, I could feel it. Sure enough, the thruster controls started blinking red, signifying that they would be as much help as my ex-wife raising our children (not that I'm still bitter about that). \n\nThen the moment was upon us. The ground sped towards us eagerly, and I pulled out my last ace, deploying the speed breaks. \n\nThey worked! Momentarily. Then they snapped clean off, spiraling away behind us. \n\nIt was too late to do anything but hold on now. \n\nWe smashed into the ground still going far too fast, slid across an open field and through a thicket of trees. It hurt, I'm not going to lie. \n\nAs we emerged from the thicket of trees, still out of control, I saw a herd of black and white cows fleeing through the paddock before us. \n\nThey were never going to be fast enough as we quickly overtook them, sending bovines flying through the air.",
        "Like a sacrificial lamb, the child was carefully loaded into the spacecraft. \n\nHe was to be a test subject, the guniea pig for a whole world, the frontrunner to a *new* world. If he could survive, then others could to. \n\n(If he couldn't, then.... humanity would only lose one.) \n\nThe baby was chosen from a pool of the many unwanted children in the world; after a rigorous selection process, he was determined to be the best. \n\nHis parents had not given him a name, so the world chose one together. \n\nHis name was Adam, and he would travel upon the *Eden. * \n\n******** \n\n*Year 8, Day 54* \n\nAdam tapped the screen, watching the animation of the portable water purifier to review. \n\n\"Aaiee, do I have to take the quiz today?\" he moaned.

        "Mary knocked and took a step back, looking down towards her shoes. Chris kept his eyes trained on the wavy oval of glass inset on the center of the door. A figure approached from the interior and the door swung inwards. Scents of pine and cinnamon wafted out, Mary's head snapped up, a smile spread across her face showing teeth. \n\n\u201c Chris! Mary! Welcome, come in, come in. \u201d They were waved inside. Mary took the time to carefully wipe her boots before stepping across the threshold. Chris simply stepped forward and in, making room for Mary to follow. They both began the process of removing their thick outerwear. Unwinding scarves, pulling off mittens and shoving them into pockets before reaching with numb fingers towards zipper pulls. \n\n\u201c It's freezing out there tonight! \u201d Chris stated gaily. No one argued. Mary, stocking-footed, padded her way towards the open kitchen with her grocery bag of tupperwares slung over her shoulder. She'd spent the morning carefully portioning out each tupperware with items to make a salad now that she was here. Chris didn't like his food to touch, so they were contributing a salad bar to the night's potluck offerings. \n\nThe kitchen was crowded, as ten or more people stood gathered near the center island. They circled, like birds, picking at various dishes and ignoring others. Mary found an opening on the long side of the island, closest to the sink, and quickly stepped up between two backs. Both people glanced over their shoulders and, noticing her pulling tupperwares out of her bag, took a step forward to give her more space. She began lining up her squares in two neat rows. \n\n\u201c What's that you've got there? \u201d a friendly voice directed her way. Mary glanced up, the corner of her mouth quirking almost towards a smile, as she finished setting out the last tupperware. \n\n\u201c Oh, we've brought along a salad bar! \u201d Chris said, appearing at Mary's side. \u201c It was her idea. So no one has to have anything they don't like in their salad. Always considerate of everyone, my Mary. \u201d Chris beamed at the other guest, his hand on Mary's low back. Mary smiled up at Chris. \n\n\u201c What a fun thought.",
        "Exhausted, Pyral fell to his knees. \n\nBeeathing raggedly, he tried to pierce the fog clouding his mind, he tried to remember why he was here. A great feeling of urgency crouched at the back of his mind. There was a reason, he knew, for that urgency. A reason that eluded him the more he tried to focus on it. But his brain was too slow, his body hurt too much and he was far too tired. \n\nGasping in pain, he rolled onto his back. \n\nDimly, he was aware that he hit his head on the stone path. Images flashed before his closed eyes, leaving behind impressions. Desperately, he tried to capture an image. Tried to hold on to one. Any of them could be the key he needed. Any of them could be what he needed to answer the only thing that mattered. \n\nWhat the hell was he doing here? \n\nSoon, that question was the only thing that pounded through his mind with every heartbeat. He couldn't even think to ask himself his own name, nevermind remember it. He had no idea how long he focused on that one thought, holding on to the only thing that kept him from giving way to his pain, his exhaustion. All notion of time faded away. \n\nSlowly, he noticed his breathing evened out. Clutching at the one thing that could help him escape, he concentrated on his breathing. The question began to slowly dissolve in his mind, giving way to all the aches in his body. He had to take it slowly, one step at a time. Taking a deep breath, he opened his eyes. \n\nAbove him, clouds floated calmly against the blue sky. The sunlight was burning his eyes, but he forced himself to endure it. Lying there, staring at the sky, the feeling of urgency seemed to grow. It threatened to engulf his mind, to drag him back once again to a state of utter uselesness. \n\nNo, he couldn't let that happen. \n\nStruggling in himself, he quelled the feeling. He didn't know how long he had lain there, doing absolutely nothing. He did know that it had been too long. Ignoring every instinct in his body, he turned his head. \n\nTall grass sprouted by the stone path, rippling gently in the light breeze. He marvelled at each individul stalk, perfectly synchronised with all the others yet in its own way an individual. He couldn't tell one apart from another. \n\nPyral frowned. Why was that important? Why was he thinking about individuals and groups? Somehow, he knew that his feeling of urgency was related to that but as elusive as an eel the connection flew around the back of his mind. \n\nAs he was concentrating, he barely noticed the bird land in front. It was a pretty non-descript bird. It was small, orange-beaked with a white and grey plumage. Standing there, it eyed him curiously. \n\nIn an instant he remembered. Eyes wide with fear, he struggled back to his knees. \n\nSuppressing the pain that lanced up his side, he found his staff at arm's reach. One end was vaguely shaped like a claw, the other was metal-tipped for fighting. Sticking the metal end in between the stones of the path, he clambered laboriously to his feet. \n\nDizzy with pain, he practically fell on to his staff. His legs were so weak it was a wonder they could even hold themselves connected to his body. Trying not to fall over, he vaguely noticed the bird had flew away. \n\nThe view was decidedly beautiful but the same in all direction.",
        "\"Not again,\" my coworker said. \"You know one of these days the player is going to arrive before you.\" \n\n\"I know, I know. I'm really sorry I arrived late again.\" I said like it was the first time even though it was probably the hundredth time. \"It's just that you know that I don't really like this job.\" \n\n\"You always say that, yet you haven't looked for a solution.\" she said. \"Besides this job is not that bad. We have our own property, we don't have to mine the gold for coins, we trade for it. There is no chance of the player or another NPC killing us.\" \n\n\"Yes and that's the problem. We always follow the same routine, even if there is no player at the time. It's really boring being the standard invulnerable shopkeepers. Also you know that we are not invulnerable, it's just that the players here aren't allowed to attack us,\" I answered quickly. To be honest I had been thinking about this for a while. Life like this tends to be boring, especially with only one player going around at the moment. I wish we weren't allocated to a single-player zone. My cousins in the MMORPG zone have it better than me, even though they can sometimes be robbed and mugged. But what's life without some risk? I want to find out. \n\n\"So what's your solution? You do have the experience to move on to another genre. Maybe you can't get a fancy job as an A.I. bot with respawn privileges but I bet you could become minion if you really want that risky life or maybe be part of a tutoria-\" \n\n\"No, I want more,\" I interrupted her. \"I want to be like the players, who roam around and can have any adventure they want!\" \n\n\"Hahaha you know that's impossible. Players are born and picked because of their unique qualities. Even if you had those qualities, you wouldn't know it because they don't tell the people what are those qualities that make you apt to be a player. If somebody else heard what you said, they would probably think that you are a villain in the making,\" she said somewhat worried. \n\n\"Trust me, I don't want to be a villain or a hero for that matter. I just want to be a player so I can go out wherever I want and whenever I want. It's not about the risks and rewards of that live, it's about being able to make your own choic-\" \n\nSadly I never finished that sentence since I heard the doorbell ring. Suddenly we went quiet, like our job said we should do and started to recite the same lines we had been saying for the past years every time a player went into our store. As usual the player grunted, dropped a lot of stuff to sell and we traded it for the established amount of money. \n\nThe worst part of it was that the player used to be my friend. We played around as kids until suddenly he was picked to be a player.",
        "Whispered secrets sat bottled on the desk, captured after being found floating around aimlessly upon their owners' deaths with none to repeat them. They held down curling yellowed parchment covered with scraps of lists and facts unable to be recovered by living minds, birthdays and last names and favored alcohols and directions and instructions on how to perform live-saving procedures at the crucial moment. It would have taken an eternity to sort through all of them, though the figure who flipped through one stack knew well enough where each could be found. \n\nThe figure was a thoroughly average sort of humanoid entity, likely a human, the composite of every loved one's face after death or distance took them, those scents which faded first from clothing and pillows and then from the mind altogether until all that remained was a memory of having the memory. They perfectly hummed the tune and lyrics from every song stumbled on in performance as they pulled out the note they wanted. There was a momentary nostalgia at the way dust motes swirled in the light as they held up the receipt-sized paper; perhaps a singular childhood image of holding up a receipt of that exact size in that exact lighting, complete with the logo of a store long since closed down printed on the back. \"Here you go,\" they rasped when they passed the memory back to the one who had forgotten it. \n\n*'The name and face of my attacker.'* \n\nTwelve letters altogether, and a hasty sketch not even worth the canvas of their body.",
        "Emily, my dearest. \n\nI am enamoured with you, and when I spend time with you, I feel so happy and relaxed! I constantly check your many social media profiles, not just to gaze upon your beautiful face, but to see what new adventure you have undertaken. \n\nI know we have only known each other for a few years, and I wanted to ask you so many times.... so often I would be waiting for you, but alas, you always had another man by your side. My pain grew inside me, I knew you were the one, but I couldn't bring myself to ask. I should have asked, but that was so long ago. \n\nLast year, when you approached me, eyes gleaming with excitement. Your mouth was trembling slightly and I never had seen you more happy than this. I was so excited, hoping that you at last would fall for me, that I would be your man. But as I steadied your trembling hands, calming you down, I whispered into your ear, \"its OK, everything will be fine Emily\". Then, I felt a cold metallic object between my fingers. What I saw next devastated me. The engagement ring Tim had bought you. \n\nI am sad to say, I was not pleased for you at that moment, jealousy stole my heart for you. And I regret much, not attending the wedding, ignoring multiple text messages, distancing myself from you.... I still would check social media, just to make sure you hadn't changed your mind. But.... I doubted even continuing to try. \n\nI lost track of time, I met a new girl, Sarah, with time I forgot about you. I would drink myself to sleep, crying into my pillow as I watched you grow. Each day you got older and older, and I was without you. Buy Sarah helped me forget. We had such a good time together, Sarah and I would attend musicals, bowl, watch movies, and eventually, I forgot about you. \n\nThen I found Sarah, cheating on me in my own bed. I began to resent her, and in turn, resented myself for trusting anyone but you. I needed to see you, to see your smile, to see your life.",
        "She was ticked off, again. They knew it was a problem with her. She couldn't help it. She'd been raised to finish what she started. But they constantly scheduled her for just start of these long flights. But she had an ace in the hole, this time. She'd gotten her certifications, and she was commander on all her flights from now on. \nWhenever she had two more takeoffs than landings, she began to feel anxiety. The feeling that she wasn't coming back this time because she'd left something undone. Like forgetting to put up the landing gear, or raise the flaps after takeoff. Well, if she had taken off but hadn't landed the damn plane at all, she had left something undone. Naturally that causes anxiety. \nBut as commander, she could take the yoke herself, anytime she wanted. Just to be sure, she told herself, she would make a point of landing 20 of 30 more times in the next year than she took off.",
        "It was a long tiring day as usual. I leaned on my sofa throwing my bag on to the near by table. Slowly dozed off to sleep. My imaginations rushed in, I could literally feel my dream and it was of none other than an episode which caught my attention today. Me and one of my colleague were having lunch and a small boy standing outside the canteen was cleaning the window panes, he was hardly 10. Full greased head to foot, filthy clothes, torn shoes but with a cherry red lips and a droopy eyes filled with all innocence he could gather within it. \nIt was raining and he was shivering after a while. He sat loopy near the window base facing me. I was having coffee then. As we started staring at each other I felt difficulty in drinking my coffee. It was nothing but me sitting comfortably inside the cafe warm and the boy now half drenched killed me within. I couldn't read any thing from his face that he is not liking what he is going through. I called him and offered him a tea. Gladly he accepted it! I asked dont you feel cold, he told no I feel close to nature. I was so taken by the love and spirit he had within and his love for nature, the smallest things which I couldn't realize which he made me feel was aw inspiring. I wish I had a mouse with me to take of the poverty in his life with a click, and fill his childhood with all the beautiful things he deserve.",
        "Everybody loves Kazaam. Or at least, now they do. \n\nWhen Kazaam first appeared on the streets, he was known only as Chris Smalls, and he didn't have a very pristine reputation. The guy could teleport anywhere he wanted to at will, so of course he was teleporting into places where he didn't exactly belong. VIP clubs, secure areas, ladies locker rooms- you name it, and Chris at some point or another got into it. Eventually, the law caught up with him, and an arrest at all costs was put out through the system. Wanted \"Dead or Alive\" joked all the newspapers. It seemed like young Chris was heading nowhere, or rather, everywhere, in a hurry. \n\nBut one day, the cops came forward with a deal. They had a hostage situation, and they could use his help; get the innocent people out of there, and his crimes would be forgiven. Chris jumped on the offer, and sure enough was able to teleport into the bank and save those people. With Chris' helping hand, they were even able to catch the crook himself, who happened to be none other than a nefarious serial robber with a hefty bounty. Chris suddenly had a clean record, and a pocketful of cash. It was then that he realized that he could probably really help the people around him, while earning a comfortable living on the side. \n\nIt took some time for the public to change their opinion of him, but soon he became everyone's favorite local hero. His face became a common sight on the evening news, and his new name,'Kazaam', a frequent subject in the paper. And this time, it was for all of the good reasons. Ironically enough, he was now getting into all the sorts of places he wanted to before, except with open doors and arms. Kazaam had a good life going for him, and it seemed like there was nothing that could stop his zero to hero story. \n\nYou can imagine Hank's surprise when he looked up late one Wednesday night to see a disheveled and slightly drunk Kazaam stumble into his bar. \n\nKazaam shuffled over to the bar counter, eased himself onto one of the stools and laid his forehead against the cool wood. Hank couldn't hear exactly what he started mumbling about, but he heard'scotch' and'rocks' somewhere in there so he poured out a glass and placed it next to Kazaam's head. \n\n\"On the house. You earned it, Kazaam.\" \n\nKazaam raised his head, stared at the glass for a moment and then downed it. He smacked his lips, rubbed the back of his sleeve against his lips and then buried his face in his hands. \n\n\"Thanks,\" muttered Kazaam. \"But tonight, I am Chris. And I'm paying for that drink.\" \n\nHank shrugged and took Chris' glass. \"Sure thing, Chris. Whatever you want. Anything else I can get you? Anything I can help with? You seem a little.... down.\" \n\nChris lowered his hands and propped his elbows on the counter. He gave Hank a bewildered look, as if he didn't really understand what he just said. \"You mean.... you actually care? I mean, you care if I'm, you know, feeling down?\"",
        "When they were found, the world rejoiced. It was confirmed - we are not alone in the universe. But what would come next, nobody could have predicted. Ten weeks after the frozen eggs were extracted from a drifting asteroid in the Kuiper Belt, they hatched, in a lab controlled environment. They were relatively harmless in birth - tiny and fragile, with dull claws and strange oval shaped heads. Scientists allowed them to grow to maturity under close observation, isolated in a chamber. Our cameras recorded them twenty four seven. The first casualty came about three months after their birth, when the largest of the creatures somehow escaped the chamber. It left only a large hole where the wall had been, and went on a rampage within the facility. Dr Jonas Ruthger, the mans name was. Impaled by its sharp claws and torn to pieces, the man stood no chance. The response task force that entered the facility to contain the incident quickly found out that the creatures have the ability to manipulate magnetic fields, not unlike telekinesis. As they rained bullets on the large predator, it simply conjured an invisible wall, shielding itself. It took two hours before they restrained it using a grenade to knock it out - gas and bullets proved useless. \n\nA few months more and they had seemingly matured. The largest predator, dubbed Apex, had begun displaying signs of leadership and extremely high intelligence. The creatures seemed to realize they were under observation, and at that point, it took them only thirty minutes to find and destroy every single camera. Being in the dark, we immediately readied the response task force once more, armored to the teeth - but as they prepared to enter the chamber, the power grid went down, darkening the whole facility.",
        "It started as a normal day at the bank. I was dropping off a check from my accounting job and I was in line behind a big guy who I'd struck up a conversation about the wildly fluctuating weather with. I'd just mentioned the crazy wind and how things had taken a turn for the worse when a couple people in balaclavas and big winter coats came in. \"See, case in point. In a couple days, they'll be putting those away and wearing t-shirts again.\" \n\nIn terms of last words before the shit hit the fan, those are pretty stupid-sounding. \n\nThe guns came out then, shiny metal with murderous intent. Suddenly I felt naked and afraid. Right after that, I realized I probably wasn't going to get to the library for a while. My mind handles crises in strange ways, apparently. \n\nThey overpowered the old portly security guard in moments as I stood and watched in shock. Unfortunately, the guard seemed to be years past the time when he was in good enough condition to provide security. So that left the rest of us. The big guy I was talking to had ducked behind a desk. The drive through teller still didn't know what was going on but the other tellers had dropped down below their desks and the other customers were shrinking away from the sudden outbreak of violence. \n\nDamn. That made me the closest person to them, and probably the next one they would approach. Fortunately for me, ever since elementary school, I had a way of dealing with people who seemed likely to hurt me. I stared at up into one corner of the ceiling and nudged my awareness into my nose, willing the blood vessels to open. I felt the pressure build in my nose and then release. \n\nI cringed, collapsed to the ground, holding my head in both hands. \"Damn tumor,\" I stage-grumbled. \"Sorry, give me a minute,\" I said, taking one hand off my head and holding the palm towards them, fingers up. The other hand slid around from the side of my head to my forehead. I appeared to struggle through a spike of pain before regaining composure, and I felt the warm damp stickiness of blood tracing down my lip, the coppery taste as it ran into my mouth. \"Right. I guess I'm...\" I winced again. \"I'll talk. I don't have all that long to live anyway.\" \n\nThe bank robbers, because that's what my brain realized they were, seemed to soften slightly. \"Hey, no worries, man, we just want the money. Don't get me wrong, we will totally kill anybody that tries anything, but we don't wan na have to kill anybody,\" one of them said. \n\n\"Thanks,\" I said weakly. \"Just take the money and don't shoot anybody.\" I hoped that had given the top bank person enough time to get the police involved and get done. \n\nAfter a few minutes of the robbers moving things around, I saw the police cars with the lights on coming up the street. I waved the rest of the people in the building to get out. They bolted and I stayed. It wouldn't have been consistent with the character I'd developed.",
        "Full lips, blue eyes, black hair. His quintessential woman. \n\nShe glanced to her side, probably feeling the piercing stare of his eyes on her face. He whipped his face forwards, watching her actions through the corner of his eyes. She wouldn't stop looking at him and in a burst of awkward embarassment, he looked out the window instead. He began to curse himself and his hopeless ineptitude. \"Fuckin' *Idiot* you are, mate. Just talk to her, just give it a shot. A pretty lass like that's once in a lifetime\" \n\nHe heard a shuffling sound next to him and looked around to see the voluptuous figure of the Woman settle into the seat next to him. Her beauty assaulted his eyes with all the subtlety of a heavy, red brick. \n\n\"Hi, I'm Anna\" \n\n\"Jim\" \n\n\"So tell me, Jim. Who are you?\" \n\n\"Pretty much nobody. I'm not anyone important\" \n\nThe bus stopped. An old couple sauntered to their seats. Jim took a deep breath. The silence started to weigh on him. \n\n\"So this is awkward\" \n\n\"No, it's not. Silence isn't awkward. It's people who are, silence is golden, silence is bliss. Come on then tell me more. What do you do?\" \n\n*As Jim relayed the details of his relatively mundane existence, she fell deeper and deeper into the chasm of her love for him. His messy hair, his nonchalance and disregard for her attention was curiously attractive.",
        "My alarm buzzed and I groaned. I knew exactly where the button was so I made an effort to slap the snooze and stretch my arm at the same time. I missed. The alarm clattered to the floor and switched to FM. Now I had extremely loud Spanish radio playing **and** I had to get up now instead of sleeping another ten minutes. I wiped drool from my mouth before slowly opening my eyes. \n\nYou know that feeling when you accidentally poop yourself? Like when you wake up and there's a giant floating head staring at you? What? You've never experienced that? Okay well that is what happened. \n\nThe giant head sniffed the air, \u201c Oh my god did you really just shit yourself?! AHAHA! \u201d \n\nSo another question. Do you know that feeling when the giant head that caused you to crap yourself makes you feel bad about it? I'm going to assuming your answer was yes. \n\nI opened my mouth to let him know what was what, \u201c WHAAGGHFUCK. \u201d \n\nIf a head could double over in laughter, this thing was doing it. \n\n\u201c Oh man, this is great. \u201d \n\nI sat up and shuffled to the bathroom, holding my backside. The head continued roaring in laughter at me. I cleaned up best that I could and wrapped a towel around me. The head was floating around looking at my T.V. and stuff. It shifted its focus back onto me. \n\n\u201c I didn't realize the human race was so inferior that they actually based their lives around technology! I mean look at this thing. What are you suppose to do with this? Stare at it? \u201d He floated over to my alarm that was still going off. \u201c And this thing is very loud and annoying. \u201d Lasers shot out of his eyes leaving a burnt charred spot on the ground. \n\n\u201c Look mister.... uhm.... Head. I'm not sure what you are or what you're doing here- \u201d \n\n\u201c That is Captain Head to you. I am on an important mission to determine the human race's progress and see if they are ready to join the galactic unity. \u201d He drifted much closer to me than I wanted him to. \u201c So far I am less than impressed. \u201d \n\nOkay. I had an alien in my room and the fate of humanity rested on my shoulders. Mother always told me I would screw up big one day. Captain Head lifted my phone up with kinesis and began to thumb through it.... without thumbs. \n\n\u201c This is an interesting device though. Apps huh? Reddit, Grindr... OH now this is an impressive app. Facebook! That sounds right up my alley. \u201d \n\nThe giant head spent the next few hours laughing and posting on my facebook profile. \n\n\u201c Look, Captain Head. Didn't you have an important mission? \u201d \n\n\u201c Not now! Someone is wrong on the internet!",

        "We cowered together under the staircase, the wind howling around the old wooden house. The loose panels which formed the wall rattled, and I shivered a little as another gust blasted through the many gaps in the collapsing structure. \n\nDespite the wind, we heard the gunshots. A harvesting gang had been seen roaming nearby, and now they had come here. They would take people captive, and sell them on as easy kills to the highest bidder. Usually they took food as payment - the most valuable of resources. Of course they needed weapons and ammunition too, but they would only kill for themselves when the victim was too strong or too difficult to transport. The townships who were prepared to buy wasteland captives were few and far between, so it was common for the gangs to kill adults themselves, and capture children. \n\nWhy, you may ask? Why would anyone pay to kill another? Well, from birth you can survive exactly thirty years. For many, the peoples of the wasteland for example, this was enough. But for the powerful, the men and women who led farms, they wanted to hold that power. And so, they paid their way to immorality. \n\nAnother gunshot. Closer this time. A scream pierced the night. I could not tell who it was, but it must have been one of our neighbours, a friend. A kin. \n\nMy brother sat in front of me, eyes screwed shut, hands buried in his matted black hair. The day had been wonderful. We had sat in the sun, splashing our feet in the river to stay cool. Despite it's misleading name, the \"wasteland\" is a beautiful place. Now that was almost forgotten, as we sat together in the dark empty house. I leant forward and took his hand. He opened his eyes, and seemed to snap out of his panic as he focused on me. \n\n\"Not quite how we expected to spend our last evening, eh sis?\" he whispered. He always had had a dark sense of humour. \n\n\"No, not exactly\" I agreed, smiling weakly. \n\n\"Although at least we're together\" he said, giving my hand a reassuring squeeze. \n\n\"Didn't I tell you I'd never leave you?\" I said, squeezing back. \n\n\"You know you might not be able to keep that promise for much longer don't you\". He looked down, avoiding my gaze. \"Mum would never say which of us was born first. Only that it was 8 hours apart\" \n\nFor the next minute there was silence between us. I knew, we both knew, that those 8 hours would be unbearable. We were roused from our thoughts by the sound of an engine starting, roaring over the storm.The harvesters were leaving. We listened intently as the sound of the vehicle faded into the distance. \n\nThim smiled. \"Well sis, at least we can stretch our legs for ten minutes now. It's almost midnight\". His face dropped a little as he mentioned the time when one of us had been born. But he quickly recovered for my sake. \"It's almost midnight so the stars will be out\" \n\nHe scrambled out the cupboard we had sheltered in and went to the window. I followed, and stood behind him as we gazed out at the stars, as we so often did. I stood there with him for what felt like a lifetime. But I knew the time was approaching.",
        "\"Dad, you're on TV again!\" I heard Eric's voice from the living room. I tried to stay away from the TV as much as I could; I always felt vaguely uneasy watching it. And I had *certainly* never seen myself on it! Had I? \n\nMy memory wasn't what it had been before the Great War, a fact my doctor blamed on the residual toxins in the air from all the bombs. I hadn't actually served on the front lines, I remember now. I had some hazy memories of six years spent at the base, helping to train the real soldiers and spending long hours on guard duty. \n\nI itched absently at my left leg. It always began to hurt whenever I thought too much about the Great War, one of the many reasons I rarely did. As I did every time I itched it, I felt a strange feeling that it wasn't exactly a part of my body, that it didn't belong there. But I had talked to my doctor about it, in one of my bi-monthly meetings with him, and he told me not to worry. \n\nAnd so I didn't worry. I stopped itching my leg, and stopped fighting the near-overpowering impulse to *STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR*. \n\n\"Dad, you never told me you won a medal!\" Eric called again, and I smiled faintly.",
        "The planet practically rung from the announcement, broadcast as it was from every speaker on earth simultaneously -- and scientists would later confirm that it was absolutely simultaneous, no light speed delays could be measured. Even unplugged speakers issued the proclamation, somehow being audible despite the lack of power. \n\nThe first question on everyone's minds was \"Who could have sent the message?\" The second was \"What's Galactic Deathball?\" \n\nSlowly, over the next few months, wars between nations ground to a halt, generations-longs conflicts were quietly resolved, and even the most isolationist governments attended meetings with other world leaders. The question on everyone's minds: How do we prepare for something when we have no idea when it will come or what it is. \n\nThe long-term changes weren't immediately apparent to the common man not privy to the secret backroom discussions, though everyone knew something was going on when the Olympics was abruptly altered, it's events taking on a more.... martial bent. Governments started sponsoring training facilities, focusing on multi-discipline events, such as triathlons, and ski-and-shoot, and even new combination sports such as the MMArathon. It became obvious to anyone paying attention that the world was training \"peak human\" superheros to compete in the Galactic Deathball, and the contenders were rewarded handsomely. \n\nYears passed without incidence, and slowly the unity caused by the message was ground away by the remorseless passage of time. The new sports lost their initial vigor, and in many countries, their sponsorship. But they were popular enough in their own niche that there was still a significant community of practitioners. \n\nAnd the the second message, as it was called, occurred. A copy of The Rulebook appeared next to every person on the planet, though this time staggered to appear as they slept. The book was written in two languages, one unknown and eye-searingly alien, the other in the mother tongue of the recipient. One upside was that we were handed the greatest rosetta stone ever made, and the alien language was deciphered almost as fast as it took to upload the scans to the internet. \n\nThe Rulebook is actually somewhat of a misnomer, most of the text was the history of the games, descriptions of previous events, and the sort of background information you would expect from a scholarly work rather than a purely technical document explaining the game. But that might have been because the game was absurdly simple. \n\nFirst, the field: An equilateral multi-sided polygon with a minimum of 4 sides a minimum of roughly 1/4 mile across and a maximum of a little under 1/2 mile across. The number of sides is twice the number of teams participating. \n\nEach team starts at a face of the polygon arrayed as they choose, and teams draw lots to determine the order that they chose which face where they start. The titular Deathball, a 1/4 kilo lump of iron with handholds designed to be easily grasped by all participating species, starts in the exact center of the field. \n\nAt the signal, everyone has 5 seconds to get onto the field. If you leave the field without carrying the deathball, you die. If you leave the field carrying the deathball, you choose who dies and the field reset.",
        "\"You're telling me your people crucified and tortured the Messiah we sent you before he even turned 35?!!\" exclaimed the Holy Pontiff sitting above me in the hearing chamber. \n\n\"Well.... the thing is...\" I was scrambling to come up with a sufficient excuse for humanity's violence problem. We were already regarded as the drunken inbred neighbors of the galaxy. \n\n\"That's got to be a record! I don't think a single species in the entire galaxy has found and killed a Messiah so brutally in so little time. In fact, I think this even beats the Volrogs record of having theirs burned at the stake,\" exclaimed the over-tentacled alien. \n\n\"Um, what?\" I mumbled. I don't know why humanity always elects it's least competent people to lead them. \n\n\"I think humanity is going to do just fine in the galaxy. Case dismissed.\" \n\n\n*Aside: This is my first submission here.",
        "A girl with long honey blonde hair knocked lightly on the door of the bright Victorian style house. Her legs shifting back and forth in a bowlegged pattern. She looked up at the expanse of the house. *She really wants to dispel the whole witch rumors huh? Oh.... She has to help me.... She just has to. * The door opened a crack. \n\n\"Business or pleasure?\" Whispered a soft sultry voice on the other side of the door. A flash of raven confirmed it was her. \n\n\"B-Business.\" She cast her eyes down to the floor and fidgeted. The voice gave a derisive snort. \n\n\"Very well...\" The door opened a smidge more and she was quickly pulled inside. \"Well dear sister.... What brings you here? Something the matter? You never have asked for me to use any of my powers.\" The girl looked at the long black haired woman that supposedly was her sister. \n\n\"W-Well..\" The woman ushered her to sit down. \n\n\"Come dear Camille. There's no need to be shy.\" The woman cast a quick glance on Camille's odd limping gait and hide a crooked smile behind her lace fan. \"Now what is the matter dear?\" Camille took a deep breath. \n\n\"It's Wallace...\" She paused. \"You know? The man that I've been seeing lately.\" \n\nThe woman gave a twitch of a grin. \"Oh yes I seem to remember him...\" She fanned herself profusely. \"What's the matter with Wallace?\" \n\nCamille flushed red. \"It's rather embarrassing but I didn't know who else to turn to dear sister.\" She took a deep breath and whispered. \"Wh-When we make love, h-his manhood seems to triple in size. Making it hurt and n-near impossible. And whenever I ask him about it he avoids the question and refuses to get help.\" \n\n\"Well I can't help him if he doesn't want help darling.\" \n\nCamille nodded. \"I know.... So I want you to change *me*\" \n\nThe woman's eyes widened in shock. \"Change *you*?\"",
        "\"I haven't been completely honest with you,\" he said. \n\nOutside the office, the night sky was made darker with the constant drops of rain. The trees swayed in an uncontrollable tremollo of wind, as if they wanted to escape the roots that have kept them alive for so long. \n\nArms wrapped around herself, she braced against the weather, all the while listening to his voice. \n\nShe had never heard him this way before. He had always been loud. Confident. Not the quiet and solemn type she currently beheld. \n\n\"The last few months have been great,\" he continued without waiting for any cue or even an assurance that she had heard him. \"But, I need to tell you. I just broke up Zoe. For good.\" \n\nDean fidgeted in his seat then, painfully aware of the underwear bunching up in his asshole. He was afraid of what he needed to say next. Being alone with her now though, he knew that he needed to say it. \n\n\"I'm so sorry V. I didn't lie about before though. We did break up last November. Some months after that, we decided to try again. And we've been together ever since.\" \n\nV followed the lightning streaking across the sky. She closed her eyes then and counted inward, *1... 2... 3..* Thunder roared. *We are right under the storm, * she thought. She began focusing on her breathing while Dean continued. \n\n\"Until last week,\" Dean said. \"When we got back from the beach, I had to end it.\" \n\n\"Why?\" V asked, her shaky voice betraying her calm stature. \n\nDean considered the question, struggling to find the right words. \"I found my happiness somewhere else.\" \n\nAfter a moment of shared silence, Dean turned away and walked to the window. Sighing, he continued, \"I didn't tell you this to force you into action. I'm not trying to make you like me. You may not even like me. You're just too nice sometimes.\" \n\nHis chuckle quickly evaporated in the solemnity of the moment. \n\n\"I'm sorry. I know you could hate me for what I did. And maybe you should. But.... I just couldn't take all the lies anymore. \n\n\"I'm the last person to speak about truths, but the only thing I truly know is that whatever we are, I just want to share the truth with you. Even if we continue as friends, become something more - fingers crossed haha -, or even nothing at all. I just..... wanted you to know. The truth.\" \n\nThe words pierced her, unleashing a heavy chest characterized with *that* feeling. She had been hurt, but in her 27 years, she knew that it is only the ones that were able to get close that are able to hurt us so. \n\nV opened her eyes then, finding Dean's outline looking out the window. She was thankful that he was looking away from her. For a while, she was content to look at him. \n\nAnd against her conscience, against the heavy pain in her heart, and against all thoughts of reason she said, \"Hey.\" \n\nHe stiffened at the words and turned around and met her eyes.",
        "\"We have a surprise for you, Edgar.\" \n\nThe nurse came into my room with a smile. I fucking hate surprises, but I couldn't tell her that. She had been my nurse for several months now, and she was a pleasant older woman. She cared a lot for her charges. At least, she seemed to. \n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, feigning interest. The grin went from a subtle smile to a face splitting gash. She was very excited. That meant I was better, but no, the doctor would be the one to tell me that. That leaves a person. \n\n\"You have a visitor! I'll bring him in right away.\" She walked out of the room in a joyful gait, leaving me unmoved. I hurt today, I really don't want a visitor unless it's family. But no one really cares when they are doing their philanthropic part.",
        "The fall leaves rustled in the wind through the crowd of children. One stray leaf found itself separated form the rest as it rose into the sky, only to land on the top of a monkey bar. As it lay there a great hand came swooping from below, forcing the lone leaf to curl around the bar. As the child let the other monkey bar go he fell flat to his bum. The leave proved to slippery of a surface for him to continue his long trek across the bars. \n\nThe child began to cry and the lone leaf could not help but feel responsible. Of course it wasn't the leaf's fault, it can not control the whims of the wind. The leaf, still stuck in the child's hands, could feel the child's pain through his tight grip. Angry at the leaf the child throws the leaf to the ground and continues his plea for help. Finally one of the teachers rushes over, stomping on the leaf in her wake, over the child. The man picked up the child and began to carry him to the nurse, leaving the leaf alone on the playground. The leaf tried ever so hard to follow the teacher and child, but was swooped away by the wind. \n\nThe leaf was then circling the playground, confused as to why the wind was choosing the playground as it's focal point. But the leaf is not aware of the wind's motives, simply of it's actions. Soon enough the leaf found itself rushed to the ground just in front of a small girl. The girl ran right at the leaf, suddenly falling. Again the leaf proved to be a rather slippery surface, this time for a shoe rather than a hand though. Suddenly the leaf felt the same sense of guilt as it had before. \n\nThe girl, much like the boy, began to cry. She paid much less attention to the leaf however, focusing solely on her pain. It seems that teachers care much more for the cries of a young girl than a boy, for they came within seconds of the shriek. An older lady came by to pick the girl up and follow the same route as the teacher before her. When the girl was safely in the nurses office, the wind picked the leaf up yet again for another few circles around the playground. \n\nThe wind apparently decided it was now bored of this playground and moved it's focal point east into the forest. However the speed was picking up. Apparently the wind was not in a good mood as it only blows this fast when something is about to happen. As the wind picks up, the leaf begins to circle a tree in the forest with such velocity that it manages to cut a small twig off the tree. Suddenly the leaf realizes the wind is continually picking up more than just speed.",
        "Harry stepped outside with his pint, and breathed deep the crisp autumn oxfordian air. *A beautiful night*, he thought, as he stared up into the deep expanse above, twinkling with stars. \n\"Do - do you want to learn about astronomy, farmer?\" A voice and a chuckle came from one of the tables laid on the street. \n\"I'm sorry?\" Harry turned politely to face his addresser. Sat at the table, cloaked in black, were two young men, chuckling to one another and passing cheap wine between them. A flash of irritation hit him, as he realised who addressed him; that most obnoxious of sub-species, *students*. \n\"*I said*.... would you like to learn about astronomy, farmer? After all, you *are* ignorant of the majesty of the heavens.\" \nA blank look, that swapped to an obsequious smile on Harry's face as he worked out his response. \n\"Oh yes, zur,\" he started, accent slipping to a mimicry of his father's. \"Oh yes, I would loike to learn about the ztars. Oi've alwayz wondered about them, but never got no learning. No zur.\" The students grinned, and one took a breath to begin his patronising lecture. \n\"Well, you see...\" \n\"After all, zur,\" Harry interrupted, \"it's not loike as a farmer Oi learnt to read the skoi to know the zeasons, or the weather. Now moi brother, *he* knowz the skoi. A sailor, see?\" The two lads looked nonplussed. \"They've been navigating boi the ztars for years. And he'd never tell me nothin'. As a farrmer, why, Oi've never got lost walking and used Polaris to orientate moiself. No zur.\" The glares indicated they had caught on. He grinned. \n\"*How* dare you? Don't you know who we are?\" Demanded one of the pair, slamming his fist on the table. \n\"Yes I do.\" Harry answered.",
        "The ever dutiful machines whirred and hummed around me. Every bone and muscle in my poor tired body screamed with the familiar pain. \"I swear this is my last contract.\" I thought it every time, but this time I meant it. Just like every time before, I suppose. I drank the electrolyte supplements, the protein supplements, and the Carbohydrate supplements, each one more foul and bitter than the last. I washed the stimulants down with water and got out of the Assisted Hibernation suit to put on my uniform. I must have been one of the first up, as I didn't see anyone else in the locker room. The computer informed me we were home. Anticipating the awakening of the other crew members I dusted off the Champagne and put it on Ice. \n\nI sat down at the terminal. \"This is Exploratory Probe Six-Eight-Twelve, Do you read me\" \n\nStatic. \n\nMicrometeorites must have bombarded the communication array, I'd try again when we entered visual range. It was strange, no one else had woken yet. I climbed back up to the center of the ship where it is weightless, where the Assisted Hibernation pods were to check on the rest of the crew. None of them were dead, but they all read Status Critical: Oversleep; Can not Waken. Fortunately we would be in orbit in less than an hour, and I'd be able to pass this problem to more experienced hands. \n\nI went back down to the Communications Array, where the Champagne sat on Ice. There was a shimmering blue star up ahead, Earth! No need to let all this Champagne go to waste. I uncorked some of the bubbly. Much to my surprise, I had to pull the cork out, and when I poured it it seemed kind of flat. Thank Corporate, always cutting corners. I poured myself a glass, toasted to my terminal, and took a sip. \n\nTHE FUCK. It bit my tongue, not with the bubbles but with a woody sharp taste, it was like licking a tree or an old leather bound book. Something was flashing on the terminal. \"Hyperdrive Failure\" I wasn't from engineering, so I wasn't equipped to deal with that. \n\nThe Blue Dot was the size of my pinky nail, even with a shot com array, we HAD to be in range now. I raised them again. A few measured beeps, but mostly static. Hell, last mission, autopilot would have taken over by now, correcting our orbit and preparing us for unload, crew update, and redeployment. \n\nI spent a few hours running diagnostics on the com system and checking internal fuses. Everything was in order. By now I could make out clouds and continents. We were approaching from the Solar side, so it was a beautiful blue-green marble, dolloped with swirling clouds. I took a few snaps of it for my family, they seemed to love those. The only replies I could raise were from automatic satellites, and even their responses were spotty at best.",
        "My body shuddered against the metal bars of the cage where they held me. It was only a matter of time now before someone would come to take me away. Somewhere down the hall a sink was running and the water dripped over onto the floor. It was the only sound I heard aside from my own heartbeat. I knew this day was coming for so long but nothing prepares you for it. I had always thought maybe I would be overlooked or spared but that thinking was na\u00efve. \n\nI heard the stories growing up that if you were a hard worker you could be saved. They would grant you Pilgrim status for being a valuable member of society. As a kid I wish they would have just told me that was bullshit. I worked hard and in the end it was for nothing. I somehow thought that because I was the son of a Pilgrim it would be better for me. \n\nMy father was a Breeder. He was a Pilgrim whose sole purpose was to create the Shells and for some reason I thought maybe he would see a connection with me. He had already moved on before I had grown up, I hadn't seen him since I was a child. I remember being in bed just wondering what it feels like to burn through bodies like that. \n\nI heard someone walking down the hallway and before long the sink had stopped dripping. I knew this was meant for me. I could feel it. My teeth rattled in my head and I shook, feeling an overwhelming nervousness I wasn't ready for. \n\nThe guards opened my cell and restrained me but I couldn't fight them if I wanted to. I was always relatively weak and at this moment I had mostly accepted what was to come. We walked for what seemed forever, passing the cells of the others who would have their bodies repurposed and I felt pity for them. Not all were taking this as well as I was. \n\nWe passed through a gate and the guards gave a nod to a man with a key standing in front of a big laboratory door. The white finish seemed out of place amongst the rusted metals and cracking concrete of the preceding room. They brought me in and immediately all eyes were upon me.",
        "*\" Approaching final landing sequence, vector correction thrusters online. Steady her out, Lieutenant. \"* \n\n*\" Roger that, Captain. Thrusters steadying. Applying left rudder, 6 degrees. Quartermaster, can you see anything yet? \"* \n\nThe Quartermaster didn't respond. His mouth hung agape as they dipped below the clouds, the surface of the beautiful planet coming into view for the first time to human eyes. Dense jungles surrounded coastlines that were lapped by beautiful, crystal waters. Out of the port side windows, beautiful flowing sand dunes were dotted by huge.... wait, what the fuck? \n\n*\" Are.... are those pyramids? Captain, can you confirm visual? \"* \n\nEveryone sat shocked within the craft. The landing suffered from the sudden loss of attention to the controls. A massive shudder gave way to a very bumpy landing, jostling around the crew and some tools inside. This didn't faze the crew, however; they all but burst out of their seats and into the expanse of desert they had chosen to land on. With awe struck glances exchanged, the crew scrambled up the dune before them and stared silently at the sight before them. \n\n*\" Lieutenant, tell me you see this. Those.... those are Egyptian pyramids. The people down there, are they...? \"* \n\nThe Captain trailed off, but Lt. knew what he was asking. Yes, those were Egyptian style pyramids. And yes, those appeared to be human beings gathered in the city before them. A small group was heading their way, shadowed by the wavy heat radiating off the desert sands. This was incredible. The Captain began calling the ground crew back on Earth, and the conversation was short and sweet. \n\n*\" Captain, this is very important. Take pictures and document everything.

        "Dr. Probability sat handcuffed in a holding cell in Diamond City's central police station. Five hours ago the infamous terrorist cell, Dragon's Bane, attempted to pull off a series of attacks that would have taken thousands of lives and left the city in shambles. Dr. Probability called in the threat and based off his ability was able to direct authorities to the probable locations the Dragon's Bane would strike. As always he was right. A few of the terrorists deviated from their plans and some were able to do damage before taken down. In all 47 were injured, and 1 was killed. Though the city sends their best support to those grieving families, many are grateful nothing worse came to city of nearly half a million. \n\nWhen Dr. Probability entered the police cruiser, he was being taken once again to city hall to shake hands with the mayor. Except this time when he arrived downtown, he was arrested under probable cause he knew of the attack and maybe even had a hand in orchestrating it. \n\n\u201c How did you know there was going to be an attack?!?! \u201d Detective Reeves yelled slamming his fists on the table \u201c Tell me know! \u201d Dr. Probability looked the detective in the eyes. \u201c Last week DB made a threat against our nation. Given our mayor's recent speech condemning Dragon's Bane, there was a probability of 33 in 40 that we would be the next target. I then went to our Herbert Park and waited for signs of an impending attack. This afternoon I saw a van pull up and explosives being subtly unloaded. I then called the authorities and advised of the other probable locations. \u201d \u201c Bullshit! \u201d Detective Reeves exclaimed, \u201c After every catastrophic event. You are always there at the center of all. The whole city thinks you're a hero. \u201d Detective Reeves took a mocking tone, \u201c There is a 1 in 3 chance that this bank will be robbed at noon, there is a 4 in 9 chance the chief of police is having an affair, \u201d the detective began reverting back to his angry tone \u201c there is a 87 in 88 chance I have been bullshitting you all! The other officers might eat your shit all day, but I DON'T BUY IT!!! \u201d The detective slammed his fists against the metal desk again. \n\nDr. Probability was unfazed by the detective's tone.

        "A painter's work is never complete, even as I add the last touches to the canvas now smeared with thick streaks to represent the water lilies in front of me. The lead paints let my head flutter for a moment before I took a sip of gin peering into the water as the sun painted its own majesty with golden rays across the pond. I realized long ago I could never reach the ideals of the old Renaissance painters who tried to compare their works to the masterpieces of Heaven; impressionism never tried to reach for such foolish heights. Instead the canvas allows us to express our innermost thoughts with the brush. If my work only spoke about the sorrow I've experienced, the joy I've found, and the regret I've found in life in imperfect strokes, I consider my work far more valuable than the stark reality Da Vinci has crafted. \n\nAs I packed my materials, a flash of light illuminated from the corner of my eye. Yet another person clad in strange clothes ran to me and begging me for audience. I simply waved them away and continued, supplies in hand, to the street. \n\n\u201c Mr. van Gogh, please, \u201d she pleaded, much like the rest. \u201c You need to listen to me. \u201d \n\nI simply ignored them and walked into the street, knowing most of these people don't dare to confront me in public. They all knew my name and hurled themselves at me, but the moment I walk to anywhere with other people, they recede, but reinvade my personal time as I try to paint. At first, I figured they were a prank meant to detract from my art by mocking my failures with false promises of fame, as if anyone would dare cast their gaze upon my paintings and see anything beyond the surface level, but their sheer number and insistence convinced me otherwise. \n\nPerhaps the alcohol has finally invaded my spirit and these men and women are naught but delusions meant to torment me. Perchance I've simply gone mad; after all they refuse to appear in public leaving me the fool to insist their existence. If the former, I can still paint in peace letting the delusions shape and form art. If the latter, I know I can still paint a sky flooded with stars behind the bars of an asylum.",
        "Journal, \n\nI still remember the first time. \n\nIt was after Christmas, and they had given him to me. I think it was the first time that I've ever experienced something akin to happiness. I was forced to live out my deepest desires all this time in my head. **Use your imagination, Doug**. Dad always thought he could help me that way -- but I think he always knew it would end this way -- which is why he brought me this gift. \n\nI had taken him apart and placed him in neat, little bags, which I tried to dispose of in some trash cans a few blocks down.

I've got this beat in my head, and I just got ta bang it out.\" I picked up a metal rod on the ground near the refuse and struck the lid of the can. Again, and again, I crafted a rhythmic beat. \n\n\"Bangin' on a trash can?\" Skeeter asked, \"EPIC! Let me find an instrument!\" And he ran off. \n\nI'd have to find a better way.

        "I am not a great writer nor have the time to write a good short story. Here is my basic outline - \n\nMichael recognizes the voice of President Obama on Call of Duty in January 2011, while playing at his home in Missouri. He is 15. Obama tries to deny it, but Michael catches him in several logical fallacies and get him to admit his identity. Michael blackmails him into being is Call of Duty partner, and Obama agrees to secure Micheal's silence about the fact that he has logged hundreds of hours of CoD during his presidency and is secretly suffering a debilitating addiction to the game. \n\nAfter being forced into a 7 hour straight marathon of Call of Duty for Micheal's birthday in May of that year, Obama begins to devise a plan for revenge. Over the course of the year, he begins to intentionally lower his Call of Duty skills, until early February of 2012, when Micheal notices he is has been playing better than Obama for months, and asks what the problem is. Obama tries to deny anything is wrong, but eventually puts into play the next part of his plan. He tells Micheal that the stresses of the Middle East conflicts are growing to great, and it is effecting his playing, but tells Micheal for now there is nothing he can do, and he hopes the situation will get better soon. \n\nA month later, Obama tells Micheal that there is a new development in the Middle East conflict. The CIA has become extremely concerned with the rise of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his Islamic State of Iraq, and some of his new advances into areas of Iraq formerly held by Us troops. In reality, the intelligence at the time was indicating that the Islamic State of Iraq was not a threat, but Obama had a plan. He told Micheal that they were beginning covert offenses using a new robotic drone technology. Rather than missles shot from drone planes, a secret US arms corporation had developed a small all terrain robot outfitted with a wide variety of minature high powered weaponry. This new technology is so controversial that no officers within the US defense network low enough in rank to take the time to pilot the drones can be trusted to do it. So this secret arms corporation, in conjunction with the major multinational banks, forced Obama to use a new software that would allow the drones to be piloted by unwitting Call of Duty players. The new software would alter the game to show the terrain and combatants rendered into whatever level and enemy they are fighting against. If he does not comply they are threatening another JFK style assassination.",

It was getting bigger with each day, and soon it would swallow their home. Neither of them knew what would come after they survived the sun's impending death. The earth was soon to face cremation, and they would be hurled into the vast emptiness of space. Would they be able to face this together, or would the event be so violent that such would be an impossibility? They would find out soon enough. \n\nThe couple hadn't spoken in years. She hadn't said much after the last of humanity died out. He knew she felt guilty, but he didn't blame her. They spent many care-free centuries together and she couldn't have possibly known it would come to this. Still, she felt as if this was their punishment, and for that- for the deal she made for her and her husband- she was sorry. \n\nThe man looked at his wife. She looked back soberly, her eyes puffy and welling with tears. \n\n\"Don't\", the man said. \n\n\"I'm s-\" \n\n\"Do you remember when we met? You were sitting outside of school, your ride had just left you. Do you remember?\" \n\nShe nodded, and he could see the corner of her lips begin to make a smile.",
        "This is it, a typical Thursday night. The clock staring at me from across the empty tavern, ticking away and weaving with the low music in the background. I drum my fingers against the wooden surface at the bar and I look down at my legs, sore from standing for hours on end. \n\nMy phone vibrates in my pocket and I pull it out quickly, looking at the time again. Had it really only been 2 minutes since I last checked? I look at the clock on the wall, then back to the phone and exhale. I check who the text is from, and I smile. Even with something as simple as \"How's work?\" I can tell that she cares. \n\nI send her a quick reply, keeping her in mind as I tuck the phone away, straighten my back and stretch.",
        "\"Mo.\" I rub my eyes with my hand. \"It's four in the morning. You have not teleported. It's just a dream.\" \n\nThe line crackled as Mo let out an exasperated sigh. \"No, Becks. That's the thing. It's actually real!\" \n\n\"Okay.\" In my half-waking state, I was willing to humor her. \"Tell me what happened, then. How did you finally manage to crack this code?\" \n\n\"Well, you know how I've been trying to get to the park bench for a while now?\" \n\n*A while? Try four years. * I bit back the sarcastic comment. \"Yes.\" \n\n\"Since that's been a total bust so far, I decided I should try out different locations. I thought, maybe the issue isn't that I'm trying to go to far. Maybe it's that I'm not going far *enough. *\" \n\n\"What?\" I sat up in bed. \"What are you talking about?\" \n\nMo giggled. \"Guess where I am right now.\" \n\n\"Paris? I don't know.\" \n\n\"Nope.\" She sounded so giddy. It was really throwing me. \"I'm in...\" She cut herself off with another laugh. \"The outer stratosphere.\" \n\nI hesitated. \"You.... what?\" \n\n\"I'm almost up in space.\" A breeze rushed by, causing a ripple of static. \"Oh man, I think I'm going to try for the moon.\" \n\nI froze. \"The moon?\" \n\n\"Wouldn't that be *crazy? \"* \n\n\"Don't do it!\" I blurted out. \n\nMo paused. \"What?\" \n\n\"Um...\" Inspiration hit me. \"I mean, don't do it *yet. * Could you, uh, FaceTime me? Right now? I want to see the view from up where you are.\" \n\n\"Oh! Sure. Hold on.\" \n\nThe line went silent for a moment. I chewed my knuckle, heart racing. *Come on, * I prayed. *Call back. Come on. * \n\nFinally, my phone rang again. I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw that it was indeed a FaceTime request from Mo's number.",
        "I was trying to focus my battered camera on a spectacularly odd-looking elderly couple at the foot of Huayna Picchu when I felt a soft touch on my shoulder. It was Oscar, the stumpy native who had been assigned to drag our pale, unprepared bodies across 26 miles of Incan heritage; reluctantly, no doubt. \n\nOscar didn't look happy. Not just in this moment, but ever. But in this moment, also. Without speaking a word he led me to a nearby rock and gestured his hand in a way that insisted I sit down. \n\n\"I receive text from hostel\", Oscar's English wasn't perfect, but you never struggled to understand what he was saying. \"Your mother was in touch. She wants you to know that Billy has dead\". \n\nThat moment there. When those last three words - just four measly syllables, a calamity of 12 damned letters - when that reached my ear and triggered the connectivity in my brain that deals with understanding. That moment there, I felt the ground move from under me, and I knew I was the only one to feel it. \n\nThe rock I was sitting on sank lower than my heart and I was now looking up at Oscar through flooded pupils. His head remained bowed whilst he asked who Billy was to me. Moments later his stubby arms were wrapped around my head and he was crying now too. \"I also lost a brother\", he sobbed in my ear. \"Lo siento mucho.\" \n\nOscar pulled some strings with another tour guide and secured me a seat on a coach that was heading back to Cuzco. I was sitting behind the spectacularly odd-looking elderly couple. They had Southern American accents. Go figure. The journey back was painfully long but it gave me time to reflect on the life I had shared with my little brother. \n\nHe was a pain in the ass, but such a good kid. We were inseparable at home. He was six years my junior, so we didn't spend much time out of the house together - except for our evening games of football. I used to stick him in goal and practise my penalties on him. It was pretty cruel but I insisted on always playing in the goal with no net. It was my lucky goal, and he was a champion at bringing it back. Billy didn't have many other friends either, he was always at home, and when I'd get in he'd be bugging me to play games with him or make food for him.",
        "Beezlebub drifted hazily awake, and immediately wished he hadn't. His head felt like someone had pierced it with their pitchfork and there was a crust of something gold and sticky smeared across his left hindquarter. It hadn't been a good night. \n\nHe gazed blearily around him. His legs were stretched out over the tattered remains of what had once been a very nice couch (maybe one of the ones that had come down with Ghengis Khan?) which since fallen heavily from grace and now resided in a dingy apartment in southwest third circle, Hell. Through the window he could make out the harsh neon light of the sign from the brothel next door, Kingdom Cum. \n\nHe stood up and winced as his torn-up hooves met the flaming floor. \n\n\"Yo Beez, you up?\" \n\nIt was his sometimes-girlfriend, Lucy Furr. Lucy was a part-time dancer at the KC next door, and she definitely looked the part -- smooth humanoid curves and long muscular legs all covered in a fine layer of black peach fuzz. Ravishing. Today, she had big lumps of black sheep wool wrapped around each of her four calves. \n\n\"What the heaven is that?\" Beezlebub scoffed, gesturing at her footwear. \"You look like a cancerous donkey.\" \n\nShe walked in and threw a balled-up hamburger wrapper at him. \n\n\"They're called leg-warmers, dipshit.\" \n\nShe paused studied his face intently. \n\n\"It's a human thing,\" she said softly. \n\nHe froze. \n\n\"You went up? How? When? Where?\" \n\nNo demon had gained access to the human world since years earlier when a few had climbed thtough the hole left after Hiroshima. \n\nShe nodded. \"There's a small cavern we found in a place called San Francisco. Apparently there's a lot of gay people there so some Christians have been building a little passageway down here to try to get rid of them.\" \n\nBeezlebub blinked. \"But why the fuck would we care..\" \n\nLucy shrugged impatiently. \"Who knows? Point is we can get back up, and there's been a lot going on up there since the thirties. There are some pretty interesting new inventions floating around in 1989.\" \n\nBeezlebub snorted. \"I wouln't call ugly socks an interesting invention.\"",
        "*The Year: 2116* \n\n*The Place: Washington, D.C.* \n\n*News Reporter: * This week marks the 100th anniversary of Congress's historic 2016 Prohibition Act criminalizing crack caffeine, often known to users as \"coffee\". \n\nCrack caffeine was originally banned because of its contributing role in a variety of social ills, including but not limited to heart disease, type A personalities, overwork, and poor dental health. While crack caffeine is a stimulant, historians have cited its history as an opiate of the masses, making them believe that the oppression of the 9 to 5 workday and the 40 hour workweek was bearable. \n\nIn recent years, however, scientists have begun experimenting with the drug. While these experiments have mainly been limited to non-human subjects, a few prominent companies are poised to start trials administering small drips to humans. It is postulated that crack caffeine's effect on depressed subjects may give it some medicinal merit. \n\nIn this respect, policy seems on pace to outstrip science. Oregon and Washington state, historic crack caffeine hubs, and Washington, D.C., a city where many prominent citizens, including Congresspeople, have been accused of being coffeeheads, are considering legislation to decriminalize crack caffeine. These regions have already instituted policies allowing for medical use of condensed crack caffeine, known to users as \"chocolate\". \n\nThere is no word yet on whether the federal government will continue to enforce crack caffeine prohibitions in states in which it is decriminalized; the federal government is waiting to see if this legislation becomes law. \n\nBack to you, Diana.",
        "\"Listen, Mr Fluffles, there's a reason we're called'man's best friend'. That title didn't come cheap\". Toby was getting agitated now - the Feline Federation were making preposterous demands.\"Dogs have been hunting with humans for thousands of years, providing food and companionship. It's only fair that, as humans chosen best friend, dogs should inherit the Earth. It just makes sense\", the grumpy Basset Hound continued. \n\n\"And what makes you think you have the ability to handle it?\", purred Mr Fluffles, president of the Feline Federation. He was a sinister looking Siamese, holding court from his Executive Play Tower \u00a9. Cardboard boxes were piled around him, holding the supreme Feline council, smugness emanating from their finely cleaned fur like a gas leak. \n\nThe dogs howled in anger.\"Just look at us, noble creatures with brains considerably bigger than your largest, diabetic mouser\". Toby snorted with derision.\" The idea that you could do anything better than us is simply ridiculous. You have one day to leave the court before our Mastiffs will be forced to evict you\". \n\nFluffles rose to his full height now, a full two feet above the carpeted platform. Fore paws hanging in front of him, Fluffles cleared his throat.\"My dear Toby, you're right - dogs have hunted with humans, and protected their children, and defended their homes. Noble creatures indeed. But what did you get in return? Table scraps, a kennel? A nice short lead? We felines have been using humans since the end of the ice age.",

You're acting strange. This is how this works, these drug deals.

I'm going to arrest his ass and find the goods.\" \n\nThey both smirked and motioned for their pockets. \n\n\"What the fuck! Don't move,\" snarled Mike. \n\n\"You don't move first,\" replied Jim. \n\n\"OK, I won't move first then you won't move.\" \n\n\"So I get the first move?\" asked Jim with a smirk. \n\n\"Shit, I guess so.\" \n\nIn a swift motion, Jim whipped out his.38 Special and slapped the butt across Mike's sweaty temple with a dull thud. \n\nMike cried out and reached for his pocket but Jim's knee landed heavily on his wrist, snapping it in three places. He lay in defeat. \n\nJim pulled a zip-tie out of his pocket and expertly bound Mike's wrists. \n\n\"You're under arrest, dick bag.\" \n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" Mike muttered through pain-gritted teeth. \n\n\"Yeah, you're fucked.\" \n\n\"The war on fucking drugs, my ass.

        "8 months since since everything changed. When I dream, it is not the fantasies I used to have, but memories of the time before. I dream of a time when I wasn't weary, when I wasn't hungry, when I still had my old family. \nI have a new family now. There is less warmth but we look after one another. It is better in some ways; I used to be a father, that brought responsibilities, expectations, I had to lead. Not now. As part of this group life is tougher, it is hardly safe to sleep and there is never enough food. Yet now I have left the duties of parenthood, my job and my life behind, I am an equal for the first time. I am complete. \nWithin this group we are not friends, we are survivors. We do not love each other, but we need each other and we trust each other. \n\nThe city is not safe. Too many rooftops, too many blocked alley ways. But there is food here, that is why people risk coming. Ahead of us a scavenger is picking through the debris, there's a gun slung across his back so we will have to kill him, no question. It is just a shame there is only one of him, more scavengers means more food. There's a good chance he'll take one of us with him but we can't leave him alive, with a gun to our backs. \n\nHe is focused on unearthing whatever it is that he can see beneath the rubble. This should could go quite well for us. We creep slowly as blood races through our veins. Pupils dilated, mouth salivating, yet we tread lightly. He pauses, none of us even draws breath. He continues digging and we continue advancing towards his back. But he has heard us, he turns and the gun is in his hands.",
        "Leave Out All The Rest - Linkin Park \n\nI had a dream last night. A dream I went missing. *She* was so scared.... so freaking scared. She thought I killed myself. She thought I was dead. But no one would listen to her. Why? Cause no one cared. But that was just a dream. \n\nI woke up this morning feeling depressed, as usual. I've been like this for a long time. That's why I'm writing you this note. If you're asking me, I want you to know that my time has come. And my suffering will be over. But when that happens, please, forget the wrong that I've done. Help me leave behind some reasons for people to miss me. Leave out all the rest. Leave out all of the pain I've caused. I live with this guilt, and I can't take it anymore. Guilt that never leaves my heart. Forget what I've done. Forget what I've done to them. Forget what I've done to you. Remember the good in me. Please. I'm begging you. Don't resent me.

        "\"How does it feel?\" I breathed. \n\nThree men draped in dark cloaks towered over me. I couldn't see their faces but I wasn't worried about their faces. My eyes were drawn to the long wooden scythe held out before me. It appeared old, aged, yet somehow untouched by time. My heart raced as I followed the wooden handle all the way up to the curved blade baring the marks of many conquests. \n\nFinally the hooded man replied in a voice that sounded low and calculated, \"It feels cold.\" \n\nI returned my eyes to the men in front of me. I could hardly believe what was happening. I wasn't sure if it was the weight of my backpack on my back or what but my chest felt tight. I mean I'm only fourteen! Just minutes ago I was walking home from class and now.... \n\nI swallowed hard, staring at the men. \"You want- want me to co- come?\" \n\nThe hood nodded and reeled his arms back, placing the scythe upright. \n\nI straightened and asked. \"How do I know this isn't a setup? How do I know you're not going to kill ME?\" \n\nThe three hoods looked at each other before turning to me. The one with the scythe replied, \"You wouldn't know. You wouldn't hear us. You wouldn't see us. You would simply die.\" \n\nA pang in my chest caused me to grip the straps of my backpack and readjust. \"I just- I don't understand. How can THIS be my job? Usually you aren't assigned a job till you're sixteen. Plus this isn't even a job. Do you even have a boss? Do you get paid? Raise a family? I just- I don't understand.\" \n\n\"This is a job.\" The hood spoke. \"Yes we have a boss. Yes we get paid. No...\" His glove hand squeaked as it tightened around the wood. ``.... we don't have families.\" \n\nMy thoughts raced as fast as my heart. Shocked, I scrambled for more answers. \"So you DO work for someone? And you're given money? But how? Why? I don- I know I keep saying it but it's true - I don't understand.\" \n\nThe hooded man replied. \"Stop.\" He comanded. \"You already know you have two choices. Choice one: you take the job assigned to you. Do this and you become one of us. We will show you the art and beauty of death. Your mind, body and soul will be transformed - for better or for worse. Choice two: you refuse your assignment and go with the dissenters.\" \n\nI gulped. \"What about my...\" \n\n\"Choose.\" \n\nI closed my eyes knowing I only had one real choice to make. I couldn't go with the dissenters. They lived in the Outskirts from where no one returned. To be thrown out and join them would be a decision worse than death.",

        "The community centre was in dire need of a makover; the council had really let things slip. There were more broken and boarded up windows than intact ones, broken bottles littered the pavement outside the entrance, and the distinct smell of urine pierced the air as you walked towards the door. Inside wasn't much better; a floor in need of sweeping, a corridor lined with damaged doors, and damp climbing the walls. \n\nAs I stood in the corridor looking around, a scrawny, bald, rat-like man jerked into my personal space. \n\n\"Hi mate!.... not seen you here before!.... You been in yet?\" \n\"Hi.... No\" I said, as the man's full-body nervous twitches wafted the smell of cigarette smoke in my face. \n\n\"I'm Gaz, follow me chap, it's this way\" \n\nAs Gaz turned sharply his long over-sized leather jacket swung around with him and he walked erratically down the corridor. I looked him up and down as I followed and noticed three red glowing numbers across the back of his head. \n\n\"666\" I unintentionally said out loud. \n\n\"Yes mate.... Born with it.... is it glowing again?\" Gaz said casually. \n\n\"Yeah\" I said, confused. \n\n\"Does that sometimes, means sod all from what I can tell.... got no correlation to anything... What you here for?\" He asked as he carried on juddering down the corridor. \n\n\"Dragon on my back.... doesn't glow though\" I told him. \n\n\"Be thankful for that!.... it's even harder to convince them you aren't special when it glows!\" \n\nAt this he pushed open a door revealing an odour of coffee and the sound of chattering voices. In the centre of the room was a circle of chairs seating by most people's standards, probably the weirdest group of individuals they've ever seen.

        "I have the feeling that I've been here before, on this exact spot, in this exact place and time, but I know for sure that it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at best. Don't get me wrong, I know I've been in similar situations before. I mean, there was that time with the pills, and that time when I was sitting in my car, with the garage door closed. Oh, and how could I forget that time with the oven, funny how such things turn trivial as time moves on, though I didn't know it was electric, at the time. But I know for sure that I have never been in this place before, as today is the first time that I actually feel courageous enough to go though with my plan. I can see that I'm confusing you, so let me just start at the beginning. \n\nMy life hasn't always exactly been the easiest, but I guess the series of events that brought me here, started around year five in school. When I was around ten years old, I collapsed while playing outside with some friends. I still remember that bizarre experience of playing ball one moment, and falling down the other, having lost all feeling in my legs. It felt like someone suddenly flipped a switch somewhere in my brain, and turned off my legs. I was rushed to the hospital, of course. I must've fallen asleep at some point, or I simply forgot, but the next thing I remember is lying in a bed, with a doctor poking needles in my legs. He then took my parents into the hallway, and a few moments later I heard my mom scream hysterically. My dad walked back into the room with tears in his eyes. \n\nIt turned out I have a rare autoimmune disease that targets my peripheral nervous system. In short, my body attacks its own nervous system, resulting in (partial) paralysis, or worse. After a few weeks in the hospital, and several dozens of tests, they told me I was one of the lucky ones. After weeks of rehabilitation I was finally able to walk again. I was sent home. I don't think I ever saw my parents so happy, my sister was literally crying when I walked through the door. I felt like I was invincible. Even now, after all those years, I sometimes wish I could relive that moment just one more time. \n\nUnfortunately, it turned out I wasn't exactly invincible after all, and every few years or so, my immune system would kick into overdrive again, and the whole story would repeat from the beginning. Falling. Hospital. Rehabilitation. Falling. Hospital. Rehabilitation. An endless cycle of hope and despair. I never was much of a learner, but I missed so many days in school that my grades plummeted. I barely saw my friends anymore, as I couldn't play outside, even in my better days. Especially going through puberty was hell, though because of my wheelchair I got treated quite nicely in school, so I had that going for me. Though as a more or less permanent wheelchair-bound teenager with little to no social life, I could have probably starred on the cover of *Troubled* magazine. \n\nThe depressions started around that time as well. Whole days went by when I could do nothing except lying in bed, alone with my thoughts, and feeling powerless. Staring into a black pit of uselessness, having no desire to do anything at all, and feeling like all the joy and happiness in the world had been sucked out of me. Even as puberty made way for adulthood, the depression stayed. In fact, I think it got worse as years went by. My parents, my sister, probably knew. I realised that they took extra care to be nice to me, to try and make me feel happy, and somewhere deep down I appreciated their effort. I didn't show it, however. In fact, the more they tried to engage with me, the more they tried to find a way to make me feel happy, to make me feel me again, the more I pushed them away.",
        "Sean sighed and turned back to Jordan, hopelessness scrawled across his pale features in the near darkness. \"Face it. We're lost.\" \n\n\"No, we're not,\" Jordan's out of breath reply came from just within earshot as he struggled to catch up. He poked his head out from behind a nearby oak. \"Look, I know it seems like we are, but we only left camp half an hour ago. We can't be that far away, and besides, we can just wait until it gets light tomorrow morning to go back.\" \n\nSean shook his head in frustration, then recoiled roughly as something hit his head from above. \"Damn it, J, now it's starting to rain. Got any bright ideas?\" \n\nTo his annoyance, Jordan grinned at him and pointed off to their left. There was a rocky outcropping with a crevice at the bottom that seemed just big enough to fit the two of them inside. Jordan was already jogging over to investigate. \n\n\"Watch it, moron, hundred dollars there are snakes in there,\" Sean called after him before reluctantly following. But Jordan had already disappeared into the ground, and his voice echoed back up out of what was clearly not just a tiny crevice. \n\n\"Get down here, man. This is insane!\" \n\nSean laid down on his stomach and slid under the rock, his initial feeling of claustrophobia instantly dispelled by the spacious cavern he now found himself in. \n\n\"Deja vu, am I right?\" Jordan piped back up. \n\n\"Not really, no,\" came Sean's reply. \"I can't even see anything. It's almost pitch black.\" \n\nJordan chuckled. \"Okay, yeah. I know we were just outside in a little light, and it's really dark in here. But this cave, when we came in.... if you close your eyes - does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?\" \n\n\"Uh...\" \n\n\"And if you close you eyes - does it almost feel like you've been here before? *Serious* deja vu, dude.\"",
        "\"Social Engineering\". Those words just slide off the tongue like butter don't they. Here, say them with me, go ahead. Social Engineering. See? I just got you to say Social Engineering. Isn't it great? \n\nI've always said that once you can fake sincerity you've got it made. Dress the part, get the right haircut, have a smile like a single, huge gleaming tooth, and just the right grip to the handshake and you become CEO just like that. Office ID? Hah, get a Discordian \"Official Pope\" card with a good picture, laminate that bad boy, and you're golden like an apple. \n\nSo I \"worked\" for Turnkey Synergy Inc. a year back or so. By worked, I mean I showed up like I was supposed to be there, picked a cubicle, and was good to go. I was really hired by Synergistic Proactive Associates to help them get a little edge on the competition. \n\nThe senior accountant of TSI was really uptight about her desk, see? Everything in place, in order, sorted, color coded, indexed, filed, alphabetic, paper clips no staples, etc, yadda, blah. Right. All I had to do was push a single pencil out of line by the merest fraction, or slightly lower the monitor. The best was turning her family photos upside down in their frames because she might not notice. Until I approached her desk as the perfect, chipper employee and pointed it out to her, of course. All in good cheer. Good heavens would she get red and cranky (but not at me, never at me). \n\nHaving flowers sent to happily married John from the HR assistant Toni was a nice touch. A few whispered words got Toni fired and I think John's living in a hotel now. Eh, his wife is mean anyway, he can do better. \n\nAnother great trick was puting USB thumb drives all over the parking lot. You should have seen IT running around that week. The payload was signed by the lead developer's private key. Man. Rotten luck. It took days for them to even discover the ssh connections to The Ukraine. \n\nOf course I wasn't above petty aggrivations. Hiding the toilet paper. Eating someone else's lunch and leaving the leftovers on the Intern's desk. Setting popcorn in the microwave to 20 minutes. An old ipod in the ceiling with a cheap speaker playing, over an over again, a high pitched squeal that was just barely audible to human hearing (I had to grin and bear that one myself). \n\nI'd steal things from Bob's desk and put them on Alice's desk. Sometimes in plain sight, while they were watching. Because I'd use a little magic called \"misdirection\". Slides off the tongue like silk. Here, say it with me, \"misdirection\". See, you didn't even notice I mispelled msdirection the first time. \n\nI turned in my reports on time and always had a slap on the back and a hail and well met for everyone. I brought in doughnuts and cookies.",
        "The tour guide looked insulted but my frat Bros just laughed. I threw a dip in my mouth and spilt from the group. As I stumbled around I quickly became disoriented and wound up in long hall filled with suits of armor. \n\nAt the end of the line I spotted the freshest medieval gear I had ever seen. I honestly think the bro had metal boat shoes and an izod logo on his chest. I was pretty drunk though so maybe not. \n\nThen I saw the plaque above his armor. Sir Thad The Dong Windlow. \"The dong, fucking epic!\" I said as I noticed one last piece of the majestic throne to The Dong. \n\nEvery knight had a special item next to their armor. Most were pretty lame like flutes, crosses, and kerchiefs. The dong was special though, this bro had a solid gold chamber pot that you just know doubled as a spitter \"no natty ice cans back in the day!\" I said in my mind. \n\nTo show my honor to the dong I whipped mine out and took a piss. As the first drop hit the gold the world began to spin and warp, growing massive and shrinking at the same time. Tripping balls would be considered an under statement. When the trip stop I was in the same hall but it looked vastly different. \n\nI then felt a metal fist grab the back of my neck. I turn to see a knight stand tall above me. His visor flips up and I see Oakley glass under neath. \n\n\"Bro! Bro? Did you fucking piss in my pot? Bro? Are we Eskimo bros? Please tell me you have some fucking skol.... Wench! Come meet my new bro wench!\"",
        "I don't think there was any rain on that strange day. Simply, the world stopped turning. Sure, the sun rose, and fell away behind the horizon, but everything outside- space I mean- was gone. Telescopes didn't work anymore. Things bent at unnatural angles to accomplish this breakdown of the laws of everything scientific. The moon stayed a waxing gibbous, night after night. \n\nI wasn't honestly sure how I killed God. I was a simple and humble man. But now that I think about it, and I've been thinking for decades now because time is stuck too it seems, I think I met him on a corner. On a corner in the city as I was walking to get coffee. \n\nI had a guy in a big brown coat brush me hard on the shoulder as I came up to the crosswalk, so I was patting myself down of course. I think I had just put my hand on the apartment key when he first said something to me. I wasn't really sure what I just heard, so I looked up. \n\nHe was plain; hadn't shaved today but didn't have a beard. Salt and pepper hair and a pair of glasses that sat on his short nose. \"You look tired.\" \n\nHe was looking me up and down; I figured he was sizing me up. I sized him up too, but I turned my eyes across the street to where the crosswalk ended. \n\n\"You know,\" he said as he lit up a cigarette and put it between his thin lips, \"I think I'm done with this.\" \n\n\"Done with what?\" I asked before I could shut my damn mouth. \n\nHe took a long draw. We kind of stood there amid the horns and heavy truck mufflers of the downtown for a moment. \"This.\" he said, pointing a finger all around him. \n\nI watched his finger, \"What? The city?\" \n\n\"Yea,\" he said taking another draw, \"but not just the city.\" He held the cigarette, cherry up in front of himself and just watched it for a moment.",
        "You know it won't work. It never does. You always wake up and then she is gone, the one who haunts your dreams, never to return. Until the next night, that is. But that has never stopped you from trying. \n\nThe thing about dreams is time goes funny. You can be asleep for thirty minutes, but have a dream that seems to last hours or days. You have no sense of how long it's been or how long you have left, even after you figure out that the vivid sensations are all in your head. You can't really feel the little girl's hand in your own. You can't really smell her tears-free shampoo, the one that is still sitting in the bathroom all these years later because your family can't bear to get rid of it. You can't bear to get rid of it. \n\nThe only thing that really changes is the sensations themselves. Once you know they aren't real, they seem to fade. Except you can still smell that shampoo, and even after you wake it lingers. \n\nIn your dream, you are walking through a park with a little girl who is holding your hand. You know her from somewhere, yet you can not place her in your catalog of acquaintances and friends. Slowly it dawns on you. This is that little girl. The one you know can't be here because she has been gone for years. So how is she here? You don't understand. \n\nAnd then you do. She's not here. This is a dream. The same dream you had last night, and the night before, and the night before that. The same dream that you've had every night since it happened. Since she left you. Since you left her. You really don't know how it happened anymore, but here you are in the same spot it happened that night. You are older and she is the same age, but you never notice that until you wake up. \n\nYou let go of her hand for just a second, like you always do. You never want to. You know it's a bad idea. But you do it anyway. You bend down to tie your shoe. You can't help it. You know you're dreaming but you have yet to change the sequence of events. But tonight is different. Tonight, you hear them coming. Feeling as if you're sinking in mud, moving agonizingly slow, you make yourself stand up. This has never happened before. You have always been a slave to the dream. \n\nYou reach for the girl, your hand moving as if through molasses. Your arm feels like a lead weight, but you have to save her. You have to get her back home or you've failed everyone. You've failed her. No.",
        "\"What the fuck is going on!\" I scream from my front porch as my feet melt from my body. I've never been more scared. Yet, there's an odd feeling that this is meant to happen, the feeling a beatle must have as it morphs from a larve. After the initial shock, I am calm. I accept my coming death. \n\nYet death does not come to me as I am reduced to hideous form. My brain, a covering of skin, and twenty or so new organs that protrude from me like urchin spines are my only bodily remnants as new urge takes over. Find others. I roll to meet people who were once my neighbors, linking our protrusions as we find each other. I can hear their thoughts. Find. Migrate. A signal enters our minds from somewhere unknown. We know our purpose. Buildings, automobiles, disparate parts of what we once called civilization are picked apart systemically, purposefully.",
        "Steven clutched his bag in his arms, breathing frantically as he dodged the trees. \n\nHe could hear the voices of his pursuers. They were getting close. \n\nSteven could not let them have the bag. He had to escape. But he was running out of breath, and he had to hide somewhere. \n\nLuckily, he was small enough to hide under the roots of a massive tree that had grown over a large rock. He tried to catch his breath. \n\n\"Where are you, Steve?\" the voice drew nearer, and Steven held his breath. \"Come out! You know the forest can be dangerous!\" Steven did not move. It was most definitely a ploy. It could not be anything else. \n\nThe voice grew further and further away, and Steven bolted in the opposite direction; they way he had come from. They would never expect that. But he couldn't run forever. He had to go back eventually. The forest was indeed dangerous, and the sun was setting fast. \n\nHis secret place! Steven grinned as he remembered, and cursed himself for not thinking of it sooner. A fallen tree further down south, not five minutes from the point of entry of the forest, made a small hole that was the perfect hiding spot. Steven would usually use that place for solitude, and had never thought of it as a place to hide his treasure. \n\nit was almost dark when Steven, after stashing his bag in the hiding spot, re-emerged from the forest. \n\n\"Oh my God, Steve, don't ever scare us like that again!\" Dad lunged forward and grabbed Steven. He hugged back too. \"You know you're not supposed to go into the forest without us with you! What were you thinking?\" \n\n\"Sorry, Dad,\" Steven used his guiltiest voice. \"I won't do it again.\" He scanned the house; his cousins had left. His little cousins, toddlers, both of them, were a greedy pair.",
        "\u201c I'm sorry, but the thing you were looking for is sold out. \u201d The government agent on the other end of the phone had said the sentence softly, yet firmly. She said nothing more, careful not to waste her resources to reason with a desperate, dying man. \n\nIt couldn't be. There was just no way. When the product first emerged on the market, it was a satire. I purchased a few cans, as did all my friends. We were amused. Who knew, that it would actually catch on. It remained on sale, spreading, like wildfire. People purchased the cans as jokes, to show their friends, to silently protest. The government neither condemned nor encouraged them initially. It knew that attacking the product would give it power. \n\nAs time went on, the pollution spread. Smog that could previously be blocked out by mere masks could now permeate even the best clothing. A fifteen minute walk outside required a ten minute shower to scrub out the dirt and grime. Then the next winter came, a colder one than most. The polar vortex, a term so foreign just half a decade before, was swinging around again. Temperatures dropped continuously, and the heaters in the large city of 25 million burned furiously. After several days, the sun, which during the best of days shredded a yellow, sickly light, was completely covered up by smog. Yet the sky did not clear. The smog would not lift. \n\nThat's when we realized it was no longer a joke. The product was no longer sold in isolated cans anymore. It was sold in huge 4L jugs, even though that was not nearly enough. The government declared martial law. The only vehicles allowed on the road now transported the product, HA! They sold them at exorbitant prices, but it wasn't entirely their fault. There was so little of it, and so many people. \n\nOut of hopelessness I turned to my safe. My apartment, new only several years ago, had walls blackened from dirt. I coughed, creating an explosion of dust, setting off a chain reaction. I finally calmed down a half minute later, and unlocked the metal box.",
        "The heavy doors shut behind me and I wait, making sure the footsteps are far away. One, two, three, four\u2026 even once they are gone and it is completely silent I do not move for a good few moments, collecting my thoughts. Although, once I break out of my stillness, completely ready to face my future, I turn around and pump both my arms up into the air. \n\n\u201c Yesssss! \u201d I yell to myself, unable to stop my sheer joy and excitement. The hall of weapons. Finally. \nI run forward, unsure with where to start because the hall is huge, and I mean huge. The ceiling is metres away and even then the walls are crammed with swords, bows, guns and spears. The floor is organised with shelves, cupboards and tables, each proudly holding its contents. I don't walk, I run to each weapon. I can't deny I am geeking out just a little bit. \n\nI see Excalibur, I see Bruce Lee's nunchuks, Thor's hammer, weapons from legends, weapons from well-known and unknown people that fought in wars from all centuries. Just weapons everywhere. \n\nBut, I keep my hands to myself. I am only allowed to touch what is supposed to be mine. Those are the rules. I am tempted but, after working so hard with the monastery I am not going to ruin it now. So I simply look and gawk. \nNo one really told me how I would know which weapon is mine, all I got from the teachers was, \u2018 you will just know \u2019. \nNot really helpful but I didn't mind entirely, surprises can be good. \n\nAs I walk the adrenaline dies down gradually and I can progress like a normal person. Mainly without uncontrollably flailing my arms about and taking a good minute to remind myself I need to shut my gawking mouth. That is when I hear the high pitched ringing, like a bell has been hit and the elongated, monotone pitch is calling me to follow the sound. I weave in between the objects, following the sound as fast as I can. At one point it starts fading away so I retrace my footsteps and turn the other way. Almost there, almost there, the sound is getting louder and I realise it is coming from above. The weapon is hung on the wall. \n\nLooking up, I see that out of the other weapons it is brighter. Not shining so that I am blinded but just brighter. For a while, I just stand there underneath it, looking up and deep in thought. I can't tell what it is but when it hits me, I am slightly puzzled. A trident. Out of everything I did not think it would be a trident. \n\u201c Poseidon, really? \u201d I say to myself. When I mention the name it glows slightly brighter. Or, that could just be my imagination. \u201c Poseidon? Trident? \u201d I really do not know how I feel. It's so bulky, so ancient, I was hoping for a gun of some kind or even a sword, I could take a sword. \n\nSighing, I grab the ladder which is attached to railings and drag it over. Climbing the rungs, I keep an eye on the weapon, unsure with how I feel. Once close enough, I see it is old and covered in dust. Most of the weapons are but this once just seems to be caked in it. Wiping some of it away, I take a firm grip and pull it out from the clips. I almost fall over and it makes a horrendous metallic sound, but it is out and the dust rises up and clouds around my face.",
        "He'd been practicing lucid dreaming. This idea of being able to control his dreams fascinated him and he would often wander around the world, flying to places he had never been. In fact, this question had pestered him all of his life: \"How can I see things and places I'd never been to?\". \n\nTonight was no different. He'd brushed his teeth, gargled a strong mint flavored mouthwash and jumped straight into bed. As usual, he had set his alarm to 3am. Just enough time to fall into REM sleep and be awaken so he could bring his brain back down to the near meditative state of lucid dreaming. Just before letting his brain go, he repeated to himself in his mind: \"Tonight, I'm gon na figure out the meaning of life. I'm gon na see the source of us all and find out why are we here.\". He was incredibly smart but not especially attractive and by any definition, an underachiever. This would let his brain free to fantasize about being the one who would one day be the most influential person in history. \"I mean, I have the brains, I'm a genius.... it's just that no one realizes it\" - he'd often think to himself. \n\n*BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP* \n\nNo matter for how long he'd been doing this, he'd get the heavy head feeling every time the alarm went off. But he always instinctively knew what he had to do. He flipped his pillow to the cool side and once more he was focusing on the meaning of life. Soon after he was in a void. He had waken up not floating above his body but in a darkness so blinding that he could not see his own hands in front of his face. In fact, he had already started to check all his dream indicators and they had all failed the test. The watch on his wrist was ticking, his could not breathe if he held his nose and his index finger did not go through his palm as it usually would. \n\n\"What the heck?!\" - he said out loud reaching to his bedside lamp switch as he assumed he had simply woken up. There was nothing, he was in complete void. Nothing was within reach. In fact, he had just now realized he was floating. There was no floor, no bed, just him. \n\nSuddenly everything around him was bright as day. Blindingly white everywhere. A white so bright he instinctively covered his eyes to soften the pain but it was of no use. His arm could not block the light. Then a figure emerged from the brightness, a human by any definition. He asked the figure: \"Where am I? What is all of this?\". \n\n\"You don't remember?\" - the figure said, the features of whom could still not be discerned due to the light shining from behind it. \n\n\"Remember what exactly?",
        "Dear Elder Brother Ryuji, \n\nI hate you. You don't know how much I've hated you. But these past years, I've had to think about what type of a man would do the things that you did. Do you remember when you stole the last of the medicine money from the cupboard? Do you remember the day our Father died? I know you do. I know I do. \n\nI remember enlisting. And then I remember leaving for the war. You weren't even there to see it. You were gone, drinking without a care in the world. But I'll tell you that our little house was beautiful. The mists; the plain; Mother waving sadly away.... It brings a tear to my eye. \n\nI will never see you again. I am happy. I am going to die -- the ships are closing in. The Americans are coming. I do not love you. And I know that you \n\n\n\nPhillip finished reading the letter for the last time. He had studied Japanese for years, and yet, he had never read something so emotional. The war had taken a toll on both sides, but he had never realized that such tragedy, even before the war, did exist in lives on the other side of the Pacific. \n\nHe wondered. He had the exact address and the name of the receiver as well. Philip looked out over the sea. The island was small, but a wonderful breeze had suddenly come to caress his face. It was a tender moment of nature -- a gift from the world. \n\nShould the intended family receive the letter, Philip knew the damage it would do. When the Americans reached the Japanese mainland, there would be no telling how much pain and suffering there would be. The memory and despair held within one letter would not help ease anyone's pain. \n\nPhillip took out the letter. He knew the last words of the letter.",
        "\"So, I'm not going to remember any of this after I wake up?\" \n\n\"That's correct.\" \n\n\"And I'm not dreaming right now? I'm totally wide awake,\" he said, not quite sure if that last bit was a question or a statement. \n\n\"Sure.\" \n\nThat was a little confusing to him, as the thing hovering over his recliner in the living room was most certainly a nightmare. It had glided through the darkness and around the corner from the hallway only moments prior, a frigid pair of ice blue eyes dug into a pale ceramic head which floated impossibly in the air because it possessed no real body. Instead, its bleached white spine dangled from the base of its skull like a balloon string, a monstrous and only half-human length of bone and yellow sinew which ended in a single venomous barb about as big around as his index finger. He had screamed, he had cried, he had made some mad and very conscious attempt to shit himself because hey, that's what people do, and after several moments in which the abomination simply watched him, he righted himself on the couch and remained stupidly frozen. Perhaps if he didn't move, the creature couldn't see him. \n\nIts name was Harold. \n\nEven now that the thing called Harold had coaxed him into some strange form of polite conversation, he wrangled against the urge to engage in some as yet unexplored and ultimately stereotypical fear-driven response. Maintaining such perfect, unrestrained horror over tea was every bit as exhausting as he never imagined it could be. \n\n\"It's nothing to get too worked up about. I've explored this very scenario a billion different ways in a trillion potential realities all wrapped up in half the time it took for you to stop making a fool of yourself,\" Harold explained. \"You'll come to no harm, although I'm eating your eyes in a neighboring dimension right about now.\" \n\n\"You're.... you what?\" He spoke with all the clarity of a man who had just pulled his head out of an oven. \n\n\"It's how we say hello where I'm from. I consume some vital part of you, and in return you may recite a passage of your choosing from the Ravaged Verse in order to absorb the essence of my infinite will. There is no potential reality in which that makes sense to you, however, so you are most perfectly incapable of common courtesy. No wonder your species is so riddled with such base parasites.\" \n\n\"Puh-p-\" \n\n\"Parasites. Infirmities. Basic and absolutely curable illnesses which your kind just can not seem to transcend. War, lust, ignorance, famine, the DMV.",
        "Once a year comes the day when if you turn eighteen you are given a test. This test would decide on whether you would become a hero, villian, NPC, or monster. My parents had belonged to the hero class and part of the Sock Monkey Guild. Mother had been a Shieldmaiden, Father is a Shinobi. We lost mom a few months ago during the last Troll war. They apparently PM'd each other for months before I was born. \n\nI'm going to be quite clear, my grades have never been what you would call good. In fact I thought I was going to bomb it and be sentenced as a monster. Thing is if you become a monster, you are forever turned into it. Your young would be human until they saw whether or not you too were worthy of it. \n\nFor weeks before my Dad has been grilling me and as I stood in line sandwiched between a guy who smelled extremely like Troll, and my BFF Lori Taylor my mind went blank. \n\nLori has been my BFF since grade two when her family moved here. She saved me half a dozen times, she's also a wiz. I could hear her mutter over and over again. Something to the affect of, \"The Troll rebellion's last any where from 5 months to a year. Three plus five is eight. The current King is Quinten...\" \n\nThe line eeks slowly, this year is a record turn out, even after the test is over we won't know how we did for a week when they post the results in the town square. I wonder to myself how many of these kids will get changed into monsters. I'm almost certain I'll be joining them, at the same time, I want to live up to my parents. \n\n\"Freya Moonstone,\" a blonde lady calls my name, in case you are wondering, I don't know how my parents decided it or if I came with it. \n\n\"Here,\" I call out.

        "The only light in the room came from the single bulb hanging from the ceiling. My handcuffs were chained to the table, my ankles cuffed to the chair, so there was nothing for me to do but wait for my mysterious visitor. The guards had refused to tell me anything about this meeting, except that it was happening. I wasn't given much choice about that. I wasn't given much choice about anything anymore. I almost looked forward to my last meal, because at least then what I wanted would be taken into consideration. \n\nFinally the door opened. Due to the dim light, I couldn't see more than the shadowy forms of the people who entered the room, but I knew two of them well enough. Donovan and McNall, two of the prison's toughest, meanest guards. They stood on either side of the door while the third shadow, the stranger, stepped into the light, taking the form of a man I'd never seen before. He was tall and lean, with close-cut brown hair sprinkled with grey at the temples. He wore a dark, well-tailored suit. \n\n\u201c Diana McFarlane, \u201d he greeted me as he sat across from me. \u201c Convicted of dozens of murders, and sentenced to death. \u201d He leaned across the table towards me. \u201c How would you like to live instead? \u201d \n\nI raised an eyebrow at him. \u201c I figured that offer was off the table. \u201d \n\n\u201c I have a special deal for you, \u201d the man said. \u201c Humanity has been given a rare chance by a certain benefactor\u2014the chance to let all people live free from pain or sadness, save one. That one person will become immortal, but live in misery so that the rest of humanity can be happy. \u201d \n\nI leaned back the fraction of an inch that my bound hands allowed. \u201c How is this possible? \u201d \n\n\u201c I'm afraid I'm not able to explain the how. I am here as a representative of all humankind, to offer you the opportunity of eternal life. \u201d \n\n\u201c And eternal misery, \u201d I said. \n\n\u201c And eternal misery, \u201d he agreed. \n\nI tilted my head to the side. \u201c Why me? \u201d \n\n\u201c Because the people of the world were given a choice, and they decided that if anyone was going to make this sacrifice, it ought to be someone who already has nothing to lose, someone who deserves a life of punishment. Those who have been sentenced to death seemed like the best candidates. I have approached a number of such candidates around the world already, and if any of them had taken the offer, we wouldn't be speaking. If you turn it down as well, I'll move on to the next name on my list. \u201d \n\n\u201c How long do I have to consider? \u201d \n\n\u201c I'm afraid I need an immediate answer. Should you choose to accept the death penalty you've already been condemned to, I'll need to leave right away. There are many out there who are anxious to find a willing participant in this sacrifice, you understand. \u201d \n\n\u201c Eternal misery doesn't sound like much fun, \u201d I mused. \n\n\u201c And death does? \u201d \n\n\u201c Well, that depends on what comes after death. If there's nothing, then, well, I have nothing to look forward to. But if there's any kind of life after death, odds are I'd be headed straight for Hell and eternal misery anyway, so what's the difference? \u201d \n\nThe man folded his hands together. \u201c There may be no difference to you, but a world of difference to the families and friends of your victims. They would no longer have to mourn the losses of their loved ones\u2014loved ones that you, yourself, took away from them. You could be the one to ease their pain. \u201d \n\nI looked down at my hands on the table. \u201c If I cared about that, do you think I would have killed all those people in the first place? \u201d \n\n\u201c I think that if I keep asking, I'll eventually find someone ready to atone. \u201d \n\nI was silent, considering his words. On the one hand, I couldn't imagine a world where no one felt sorrow for the loss of their loved ones. In my experience, sadness sucked, but it made happiness that much more awesome when you could get it. If all you knew was happiness, would you ever really notice how happy you were? \n\nOn the other hand, I could take away pain that I had personally inflicted on so many survivors, and wouldn't that make a better justice than just having my own life taken? If I stayed and was put to death, my victims' families might feel avenged, but they would be happier if I took this deal. I couldn't pretend I didn't feel my guilt. Maybe I could make up for some of my crimes, at least. \n\nI raised my eyes without lifting my head. \u201c I'm your girl. \u201d \n\nThe corner of the man's mouth lifted in a small smile. \u201c You understand that you will not be released from prison? You will live out the rest of your eternal life here.",

        "Was Sally being foolish? Perhaps a little crazy? Maybe. Her volcano flew in the face of a thousand cliches. In fact, just last year, we lifted the ban on a number of forbidden entries. Volcanoes were at the top of the list, followed by ant farms and sea monkeys. \n\nThe ban was put in place for the past ten years because of the sheer number of these textbook projects. For ten years we forced the kids to stretch their imaginations, rather than simply breaking the spines of their science books. \n\nBut, there was Sally, sitting there at her table. The grin on her face was impish, not at all like her usual reserved self. I couldn't believe that this straight-A honor roll student would pursue the most tired and boring of the projects. \n\nAt first, I assumed she was just busy with her studies and came up on the deadline with nothing real to show. It must be a one-off. She dropped the ball but was trying to save face. Certainly, it couldn't be anything else. Only the most uninspired resort to something this basic. \n\nAfter a little rationalization, I decided that it didn't surprise me too much that she would skimp on the effort involved. She had a strong liking for archaeology, and would state time and time again that it was her passion. \n\nSo, maybe science just wasn't her strong suit. \n\nBut that smile... it betrayed something that I should have caught on to. \n\nHer volcano was standard fair quality at first pass. It was about the size of an overturned bucket, paper mache, and possibly spray painted. It had a towel laid longways on the base of it's foot. This was presumably to ensure that any discharge was absorbed rather than dripping onto the floor. \n\nAll the usual diagrams about the various type of volcanoes accompanied it: Shield, Cinder, Composite... boring stuff. Possibly copied directly from the textbook. \n\nThe interior of the volcano was illustrated, and the telltale vinegar sat to her left, a sure sign that she was going to dazzle me by making something \"amazing\" happen. I wondered, as I looked over this chicken-wire monstrosity, whether she had dyed the baking soda held within. What color would I be looking at for thirty seconds as I tried to keep my boredom from showing? \n\n\"Welcome to the world of volcanoes!\" \n\nOh? She was starting her presentation. Well, I guess it was time to pay attention. \n\n\"For eons, man has gazed at these pits of glowing magma with bewilderment! What secret gods and demons dwell within? How can we be safe? And what actions can shield us from the horrors of the earth?\" \n\nWell, if nothing else, it was attention grabbing... \n\n\"We will delve into this question, but first, we will need some volunteers!\" \n\nI looked about, slightly confounded. There was only me judging her table. She wasn't about to get audience participation from people shuffling by. \n\nJust as my face expressed my confusion, she lifted the towel in front of the volcano with a flourish. \n\n\"Behold! The mighty ant colony of Pompeii the Second!\" \n\nI was now looking at a thriving ant colony, meticulously cultivated. The ants were large carpenter ants, nearly an inch long. They were forced to dwell in a small Grecian city of Sally's construction. There was no underground for them, only the detailed houses constructed to emulate an ancient municipality. The city was meticulous, to say the least. \n\n\"Ah! There they are! The citizens of my ant-topia. They worship this mountain every day, not realizing that a shifting of tectonic plates is about to seal their doom!\" \n\nAt this, Sally removed the tablecloth that surrounded the volcano. Below was a cutaway of the tectonics below the volcano. The detail was of the highest quality. \n\nAnd below that was a metal box with a single button and tubes connected to what appeared to be a pressurized tank. \n\nIt was at this moment that I noticed that the city of the ants contained an ocean as well. It was a fish tank, positioned in a way that it was visible from the front of the table, and it was filled with... yes. it had to be. Sea monkeys. \n\nSally plucked an ant from the city as I marveled at the detailed tectonic plates and the labels that described the fault line that was soon to erupt. \n\n\"Will a sacrifice to the gods appease the mighty volcanoes wrath?\" \n\nShe dropped the ant into the cone with a cackle. \n\n\"No!\" \n\nAs she pressed the red button, I watched as the plates separated, and a gush of hot steam flew from the top of the volcano. The sound turned heads and soon people gathered to watch.",
        "Tania stopped stirring the pot of spaghetti sauce. Her light, airy chatter had cut out as well, leaving silence where there should have been a resolution to her anecdote. One of her hands was frozen around the wooden spoon and the other was curled possessively around the base of her swollen belly. Her eyes were fixed on nothing, wide and glassy. Charlie bolted out of his seat. \n\n\"What is it? Is something wrong with the baby?\" He reached his hands to help her but paused, not knowing if this was really his place. \n\nShe gasped then, her face constricting in pain. \"Yes, yes everything is wrong.\" Her voice was strained. \n\nCharlie swallowed thickly. \"You don't think it's uh,\" he licked his lips and whispered,\" a miscarriage.\" What were the signs of miscarriage? What could he do? \n\nTania jerked her head toward him, eyes narrowed. Her voice was hard when she spoke. \"No, Charlie.\" \n\nHe opened his mouth as if to ask something but quickly thought better of it. \n\n\"I just realized that I'm probably going to have to do this alone.\" Her tone softened and her shoulders slumped. Defeated. \n\nTheodore was still overseas. Charlie didn't know much about deployment but he'd assumed that things were wrapping up over there, that his sister would be reunited with her husband long before their baby was born. \n\n\"They don't know where he is, Charlie. I got the call yesterday.\" She slowly sank to the floor, head in hands. \"Theo is missing in action.\" \n\nCharlie thought that maybe a miscarriage would've been easier to deal with at this point. He felt like an idiot searching for the right words. He kneeled next to his sister on the cool tile and wrapped his arm around her shoulders. \n\n\"What am I supposed to do? I haven't painted the nursery, I haven't gotten a crib, I don't even have clothes for the baby. What if its little toes get cold? I can't be a single parent, Charlie.\" Her breathing was coming in ragged, panicked gasps. \n\nCharlier pulled her closer. He would make this better. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nThe next few months Charlie doted on his sister.",
        "I signed back that I couldn't. \n\n\"Go near music,\" she signed back, motioning me to the bass at the edge of the crowd, where I could better feel the vibration. \n\nI didn't like it in here. Everyone too close and stuffy. People moving to the invisible waves, like they had all gone crazy and I was the only one that could see it. Hearing people were weird. \n\n\"Better?\" My date asked, raising her eyebrows for non-manual marker. \n\n\"Yes,\" I knocked on the open air. \n\nSome of the dancers were staring at us now. \n\nI would have been upset if J hadn't smiled. That was her name-sign anyways, just a J near my cheek, like the sign for juice. Her written name was Jenny. \n\nI couldn't think of anything to sign, nervous until she grabbed my hand and pressed it against the pulsating black box. I noticed more people staring, and focused on J instead, watching her as I uncertainly danced along with the other inmates in my own personal insane asylum. \n\nI would rather be home, watching a dubbed movie or reading a book, anything besides this exhibition where I hung like an art-piece for a bunch of slack-jawed yokels to gawk at. I was tempted to leave right now and drive myself home. \n\nUnfortunately J drove, and I hoped beyond hope that it was because she wanted to save me some time finding the place and not that she imagined that I couldn't.",

        "A part of me certainly knew what I should do. I should have offed myself the first moment that I knew. Of course, I'd seen all the movies, read books, everything. I knew what the moral, upstanding citizen should do. But, just like that guy in a zombie movie who gets bit and never tells anyone, I got bit and never did a thing about it. \n\nThe part of me that was sure I would always make the right choice come some difficult decision turned out to be wrong. I mean, I had never quite anticipated this, how could I? On the first day I was terrified, more that I had been mauled than the connotations that it brought with it. By the end of the first week I was still terrified, but more at the responsibility that rode on my shoulders. Of course, I put it off. I said that I would do it later, I had things I had to get in order, people to see, you know, all those excuses people make. Suicide was just too much of a thought for me to actually go through with it. \n\nAnd then, I began to think that maybe suicide wasn't my only option. Surely, since it was so under the radar that meant that there were people like me who didn't go on murderous rampages, otherwise it would hit the news and everybody would know. At least, that's what I liked to tell myself. I knew the real reason, I just didn't like to think about it.",
        "How we both ended up on an elevator in America, I can never be quite sure. It had been years since the war, and the appeal of the states had drawn me from my war-torn home in Warsaw. I had noticed the man briefly before entering the elevator. We were both on the top floor of the skyscraper, looking out over the pristine American city. As the sun finally set, we both exhaled softly and headed toward the elevator doors. \n\nWe both stepped in, and the doors closed us in together. I stayed to one side, as far away from the man as I could. I'd never been keen of tight quarters. He pressed the button for the lobby, and asked me where I was going. I told him we were going to the same place. The small talk continued at a slow and awkward pace. A few words per floor, maybe. The ride down was a long one and he, like myself, seemed to be the quiet type. \n\nThe more he spoke, though, the more eerily familiar his voice sounded. \nHis voice gave me great discomfort, and my claustrophobia began to come on in full effect. Sweating profusely, I darted toward his side of the elevator and as I reached my arm out to tap the button to get me off at the next floor, my sleeve slid up my forearm to reveal a faded \"561340\" tattoo. I quickly shuffled my sleeve back down my forearm and darted off of the elevator onto the random floor. \n\nI looked at the man for the first time face to face. His eyes were widened, aimed at me, but shooting through me and into the distance in a blank stare. \n\nAs the elevator doors closed in those brief fleeting moments, I felt 1942 all over again. The brick walls. The straw beds covered in bodily fluids. A longing for a woman whose ashes were scattered somewhere in Germany.... maybe around the whole world by now. And his eyes. Those god damned eyes, always haunting.... patrolling. I pointed a trembling finger at him just before the doors finally closed.",

I'm aware.\" \n\n\"And you want to meet him?\" Stephanie asked. \n\n\"Yes, ma'am, I do,\" he answered. The boy began coughing.

        "That day I woke up and my new wings were poking into the dark oak headboard. \n\n\u201c What the- \u201d \n\nAlice was gone. Something urgent had obviously called her. Occupational hazards of being the most powerful woman in the free world. I shook my wings. \u201c Very funny, Tara. \u201d My daughter couldn't hear me, but she had obviously stuck them on with some sort of adhesive. I stretched, yawned and tried to pull them off. It hurt like hell. As I was contemplating what sort of punishment to give Tara, Alice walked in. She, too, was sporting a pair of wings, but they were dark as coal. One feather, however, had a white tip. There were massive circles under her eyes, and I got the feeling she had been up all night. \n\n\u201c Did she put the wings on you too? What will she come up with next. This is worse than April Fool's Day when she tried to issue a First Daughter's executive order for tax-free jellybeans. \u201d \n\n\u201c It's not funny, Tim. Everyone has these wings. Everyone. I've gotten frantic calls from across the globe. Suddenly, they just appeared, and no one has any idea what to do with them. \u201d \n\n\u201c You've got to be kidding me. \u201d \n\n\u201c It's a crisis. But my advisors say it's not so bad. Some people have learned to fly. \u201d \n\n\u201c What? This is great! Think of the possibilities! Aerial yoga! Loop-de-loops with the kiddos! Flying races! \u201d \n\nAlice let out a massive sigh. \u201c Tim, this is serious. Biologists are baffled; there's people flying in the streets, criminals are cutting telephone poles, breaking into high-rises. I just came to tell you I'll be in meetings all day. If Tara needs anything, tell her to call Ophelia. \u201d Ophelia was her assistant. \n\n\u201c Is dinner with the Second Lady and the VP still on? \u201d \n\n\u201c We'll see. Oh, and Tim? \u201d \n\n\u201c Yes? \u201d \n\n\u201c We gave the order to drop the bomb on North Korea four hours ago.

        "When I figured it out, that only good things happened to me at the expense of others, I cocooned myself. I rarely got out of the house that I lived alone in. No one to keep me company, no one to hurt. So it was odd that I happened to meet Mr. Moore that day. I generally tried to talk to no-one, but a thought burned through my mind like a freight train - I couldn't avoid knowing it was there. I went and spoke to him and filled in the forms. \n\n6 months later, I was in a cave in a God-forsaken land, fighting a fight for people who didn't want us there, talking into the radio. \n\n\n\"Beachcomber 21 calling in, Beachcomber 21 calling in, target is just in the midst of leaving, can I get a drop directly on my position?\" \n\n\n\"We can drop in 1 minute, Beachcomber, good luck to you\" \n\n\nJust under a minute later the whole cave shook as heavy bombs destroyed my position, along with the regional insurgent leader. He was caught just exiting the caves, killed instantly. I had hung out with him for the last 48 hours, sucking his luck away, hoping that I'd gotten enough to survive the bombings again.",
        "Parched air filled my lungs and I awoke with a start. \n\nThe rough grass and slightly damp soil beneath my bare body seemed just like any other savanna landscape -- other than occasional patches of grass that seemed to flow rather unnaturally -- yet I couldn't shake the ominous feeling washing over me. \n\nIt was then I realised the soil was slightly damp; though not with the fresh wetness of rain or morning dew. It was something that hit much closer to home -- a sickening smell of iron that threatened to engulf my senses. Something was desperately off. Where am I, and why am I here? \n\nAs I slowly regained my senses, I stumbled uncertainly to my feet. Memories started to trickle back, and I vaguely remembered a large pang of pain before losing consciousness. Ah, that's right. I'd been stabbed. The realisation hit me calmer than I would have expected, and a small voice at the back of my head wondered if I was perhaps in heaven. Afterall, there was no reason for me not to be, was there? \n\nI was a good student, who had always been respectful to teachers. My grades were pretty decent, not the top of my class or anything; but definitely on the better spectrum of students. I was a good daughter, too; who had a loving relationship with my parents and my two siblings. Sunday mornings were always dedicated for church, and I had faithfully practiced my religion; above everything else, for the 20 years I had spent on the materialistic world. \n\n\"Welcome, to the new round. A warm welcome to our new arrivals, and I'm glad to see all of our returning players refreshed and ready to go. The game will start in three minutes.\" \n\nA booming voice cut through my thoughts, and left me even more confused than I had been. Players? Game? What kind of weird fantasy world have I been thrown into? My head swarmed with questions, and a creeping feeling of unease left me rather paranoid. If this was what I had been working towards my whole life, then I'd say it wasn't worth all my time devoted towards finding \u2018 true fulfillment'without the need for materialistic goods.",

        "A klaxon shrills throughout the cold metal of my enclosure. I awake, startled, and try to make my conscious brain aware of my surroundings. Where am I? I look around and take in my location. I was sitting on a metal cot, my feet on the floor and my back against the wall, fast asleep. \n\nThere are shoes on my feet. Thick, massive boots. I am wearing a white shirt and orange pants. The floor is a metallic grate that screeches and squawks under my thick boots. The wall in front of me and to my left is a flat white. I reach out to touch it. It is cold. Behind me, the wall bears a similar story. White matte covering cold steel. My only mental salvation lies to my right. The wall mimics the others, but with one crucial difference: a tall door rises up from the center of the floor. There is no window, nor do I see a way to open it. \n\nA second klaxon blares through my habitat, jerking me from my thoughts. What is happening? I stand up and attempt to step toward the door. The boots are heavy. So heavy. My foot lands and I try to pick up my other one. It stays on the ground, immobile. I lose my balance and begin to fall. In an effort to correct myself I try to slide my other foot underneath me. It too is now locked to the floor and I lose my footing. I land hard on my left shoulder, filling it with a sharp pain. It too feels familiar, as if it's happened before a thousand times. \nSuddenly I hear a voice erupt seemingly from nowhere, filling my tiny cabin with a sense of control. \n\n\u201c Prisoner 127! Move back to your cot \u2013 now. \u201d \n\nWho is this? Who is prisoner 127? Is it me? This feels familiar, but wrong\u2026 in an inexplicable way. \n\nThe order is repeated, this time the tone more strict and severe. \n\n\u201c I\u2026 can't! \u201d I reply, helplessly. My feet can't move. \n\n\u201c I will not tell you again, \u201d the voice demands. \n\nI try to regain my stature. To my surprise, the boots now will move as I slide my feet under me. I pick myself up and sit back on my cot, as the voice requests. \n\nWith a sharp, metallic sound my boots once again adhere themselves to the floor. I am stuck. The door opens to my right. I manage to inhale a quick breath of air before three men in dark, unmarked, protective gear and helmets enter the room and grab ahold of me. I wanted to shout, \u201c What the hell are you doing!? \u201d But the wind was knocked from my lungs by one of the assailant's helmets crushing into my chest, pushing my chin toward the ceiling. With my head locked into place by a helmet and my feet magnetically sealed to the ground, the remaining men then grab an arm each. The man in front of my grabs my head and pushes it between my legs, locking it into place under the weight of his body. From there my arms are twisted behind my back and locked together. I hear the sound of zip-ties clicking together, and feel the tightness of them on my wrists. The sound is familiar. \n\nThe two men on my flanks lift me up while the third exits the room. With a quick hand gesture, I feel the floor release my shoes from its metallic grip. He comes back into the room and places a bag over my head. I am escorted from the room. \n\nThe boots are heavy.

May I come in?\" \n\n\"Of course.\" She replied opening the door with a smile. Smiling, of course, because she was about to be 1000 dollars richer. \n\n\"Children, time for lunch!\" She called.

Thraxxich stood at the doorway. \n\n\"The procedure doesn't hurt, right?\" The matron asked, suddenly worried. \n\n\"Not physically.\" \n\n\"What do you-\" the matron started, but was interrupted by the transformation. In Thraxxich's place, a creature with 9 slimy tentacles and a mouth with rows and rows of teeth reared up, towering over the children. The sound of 20 screams was not enough to drown out the ear-splitting roar the monster produced. The monster slowly recorded the kid's reactions, along with the matron, who screamed until she passed out from fear.",
        "\"Here's the thing my boy is challenged,\" I stare out the window at the blue day. I know this man is going to pay me so I attend to play around a bit smell the clouds find the clown face round the spaces of sky them oh look, I see it it looks like Ronald mcdonald. \n\n\"Challanged?\" I say now paying full attention. What am I setting myself up to who is this kid exactly. What am I in for? \n\n\"I.C, imagination challenged got it, this is why your here, I'm giving you money to watch my kid play with him pretend to be his imaginary friend you a actor you can drizzle just a bit of play into him, I'm counting on you to make it happen. \n\n\"Got it boss. \"I replied staring at his unusual nose and then the back of the hallway.\" \n\n\"Hes right inside his bedroom right there just go in as soon as you came out with fun unlocked in boys hands, I will give you the money.\" \n\nI opened the boys wooden door slowly it creaked and I backed away but then slid the unusual door open. \n\nThe room was grey and tidy with no child art on the walls it was just empty and wrong all I could think was to say get out, get out. But I couldn't run I had to stay in order to pocket the cash. \n\nHe sat there with desperately needing someone to make his day he was small and crumpled like a paper ball on the ground. \n\nI reached out my hand and grabbed the sun.",
        "It all lined up so perfectly. The prophecy of the Al'tiine, the blind man who only spoke to me in riddles and gave me the secret to closing the portal, and the fact that I was one of the seven who could hear the whisperings of the Night Shadows and was actually in place to stop their invasion from the ninth dimension. \n\nI bled, suffered, and killed to make it to the center of the forgotten desert before the gateway opened fully, despite the fact that the Others had caused the world to go silent. It's true that some people offered me assistance, but it was never to accompany me, only trinkets to ease their guilt. I had to walk the dark path of Malgorga alone. I questioned whether I would leave with my sanity. \n\nBut, I didn't give up because deep down, I knew that I was the chosen one. I knew that I was special and that I had finally found my true purpose in the world, and it was to be the one true savior of existence. The world would come together to celebrate me. Statues would be built in my likeness, and mother's would name their children after me for generations. I was going to be remembered as a near god for countless generations. \n\nIt was thoughts like these that kept me going right through to the end where I managed to find and exploit the weakness in the unearthly, ashen grey behemoth guarded the portal. I chanted the spell that the blind man had given me, over and over, and I watched the portal slowly close. I could feel all of the hatred of the Elders of the Night Shadows bath over me, and I knew that it was all at an end and I had saved everyone, and then.... \n\nEverything went black, and I started to tumble through darkness. I almost lost who I was as a person, and while I struggled to understand what was happening, I heard a booming voice saying, \"Game Over\". What game? What was over, I had saved everything, what was happening? \n\nThe voice boomed again in the blackness, \"Insert More Tokens.\" I heard the shrill sounds of falling metal, and I suddenly my fall was stopped, and I was on my feet. I looked around and realized that I was back in my home, right were it had all started, and that it looked exactly as it had before the raid; all the damage was gone.",
        "My father was standing on the balcony when I found him, silhouetted by the setting sun. His vestments were strewn across a chair and he had a drink in his hand. He sipped thoughtfully as he looked down across the bay where the fleet lay at anchor, the royal crest flapping in the breeze. \n\n\u201c Father? \u201d I ventured, quietly. He never was a particularly sociable man, and I hated interrupting him when he was in one of his moods. To my surprise I was met with a silence that stretched out between us instead of the usual bitter recriminations or cutting remarks. \n\n\u201c Yes, son? \u201d He asked after a while, not turning to look back at me. His shadow stretched across the floor, a silent affirmation of the presence of the man who held the lives of millions in his hands. I was still trying to sort out what I was going to say when he continued, \u201c Your brother is dead. His party was ambushed on their way to the front. They delivered his head to me in a box. \u201d Anything else that I had thought to say slipped out of my head immediately. \n\n\u201c He\u2026 \u201d \n\n\u201c Is dead, yes, please listen when I am speaking. \u201d My father sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201c I apologize, I am\u2026 distraught. \u201d I must admit I was rather taken aback, my father had never once apologized to me in the twenty or so odd years I had known him. As he turned to me I was suddenly struck by how old he seemed, an eternity of sorrows etched into the creases of his face. \u201c I have sat on this throne for thirty one years, son. And what have I done in all that time? I ignored the teachings of my own father, believing that the might of our kingdom was unstoppable. When I think back to the days of my youth I feel such foolishness. There is always more to learn, son. Even after all this time. \u201d \n\nI tried to stammer a response but I was still being crushed under the enormity of his simple proclamation. He continued on, \u201c And now look what I have done. The son I groomed and taught all the ways of warfare and rule is dead. Killed in an instant by a lucky pack of scavengers. I have ignored you for too long, I fear. Perhaps I saw in you too much of myself. Your brother was very much like my father, you see. Cunning, ruthless, with a keen eye for strategy. \u201d \n\n\u201c But he was the heir, sir. \u201d I said, and through a haze of disbelief I remembered my brother's wife. \u201c His marriage has already been consummated, surely- \u201c \n\n\u201c His wife bears no child. \u201d He interrupted immediately. \u201c And as the eldest living male descendent of my house, the throne falls to you. It will be a difficult road, my son, and we have so little time. Perhaps I will come to realize that you will be a greater ruler than even your brother might have been. \u201d \n\nI had never considered or even made pretensions to the throne; it had always been my brother's birthright. But standing in my father's quarters with the sea winds blowing in and the last sunset of summer sinking below the horizon, I could almost see myself there. \u201c I will endeavor to do my best, father. \u201d \n\n\u201c Here is your first lesson: be ever vigilant. Across the sea there are many that would come to our shores and kill our people for wealth and enrichment. To the north and east enemies press in, looting villages and killing as they go. \u201d He took a long draught and set his empty glass on the railing. \u201c They call us monsters, son. And you must be ready. \u201d",
        "He looked up at me, blood dripping from his bruised knuckles. His eyes burned with something I had seen in those who served me with unquestioning devotion: pure rage. \n\nHe had been a good servant, and an even better mage. If he had been given a few more years, perhaps he could have amounted to something. \n\nAlas, there he lay. His once fair face mutilated and smashed by the raw strength of this supposed hero and his newfound power. He rose from the marble floor and sent the limp body flying toward me, missing left. \n\n\"So this is the price you would pay to defeat me? Sacrificing your friends and drinking the cursed blood? You know that even if you do manage to kill me and succeed in purging this from your body, your bloodline is tainted. You will never have offspring. The line of kings dies with you.\" \n\nHe slowly advanced on the throne. With ragged and heavy breaths, he slowly spoke \"I.... DO N'T.... CARE! YOU AND ALL YOU HOLD DEAR WILL BURN AS I DO\". \n\nAlready I could see his veins pulsing red, his eyes turning to midnight. The demonic ichor he had ingested was consuming him.",
        "Cyrus sat near the fire, his eyes closed as if in deep thought. Athene looked at him, wondering what in the name of the gods the fair-haired healer could be thinking of. \n\n\"He's still meditating?\" Grao sat next to Athene, two freshly killed rabbits in his hand. \n\n\"I think he fell asleep.\" Athene rolled his eyes and put down the stick he'd been using to poke the fire. \n\nIt had been two months since the three joined forces. Well, since Cyrus joined to be more precise. Their most recent mission was to capture at least three Black Dragoons for a certain hotheaded blacksmith in town. Athene wasn't exactly friendly with Cyrus, but he wasn't exactly hostile either. \n\n\"I can hear you.\" Cyrus opened one eye and looked at the young red-head. \n\nIf one needed further proof the blacksmith and Athene were mother and son, their temper was certainly said proof. A **glance** had set of Athene's nerves and he was already a few yards away when Grao finally noticed. As expected of a little thief. \n\nAnger soon turned to panic as an arrow lodged itself in a tree just inches from Athene's face. Three more arrows followed, and Athene ran. He wasn't sure if he was heading to the others. He reached for hia dagger, only to find it was not there. \n\n*By the fire.... * He remembered setting it down, but not picking it up. He swore under his breathe and tried to remember the path he took after so childishly stomping away. \n\nAn arrow hit Athene right in the shoulder. It only slowed him down, but it was just enough for Athene to see a flash of steel aimed right for his head. \n\nHe closed his eyes and dived for the ground. Or rather, he was pushed. Athene looked up and saw a familiar figure in pale white and blue clothes. The green eyes that had somehow angered Athene earlier were now intensely focused on the bandit in front of them. \n\nCyrus had a steel wire wrapped around the bandit's wrist. With one pull, the bandit lost a hand. \n\nBlood was practically pouring out the stump, and Athene was still in shock. What Cyrus did next added to it.",
        "\"it's finally been a hundred years for the people of Earth,\" spoke the great alien general to his command room, their'mother ship' surrounded by a fleet of a hundred thousand ships, each with the capabilities to destroy a city from high orbit. \"We, the greatest wagers of war in the Universe, ride towards the unknown. It is almost thrilling.... how I have missed this feeling.\" \n\n\n\"We're coming out of the wormhole, General. No signs of any defences on the perimeter of the system.\" \n\n\nThe general flicked their long green tongue in distaste. \"Perhaps I gave them too little time. This won't be much of a challenge.\" The fleet of ships entered the system of Earth, the main force holding steady before the field of asteroids which was thought to be a prime defensive position that the Earthlings could reach by now. \n\n\nHours were spent sending scouts and gathering information on the system to see how far along the Earthlings had progressed, but they found nothing. Even system wide scans of technology or cloaking systems were turning up negative.... for a moment, the general felt a chill run down his spine. Had the Earthlings learned of a way to hide their technology? It felt like a challenge, and one that the great general couldn't resist. Perhaps he was being too optimistic about the potential of the Human race. \n\n\n\"Move our most advanced scouts towards the known flight path of earth. Send two.... no, three. Losses will be acceptable.\" \n\n\nSeveral hours later one of the scouts reported in to the mother ship after landing on Earth, giving a live video feed as they strolled casually through a city street. \"General, no one is here. We haven't seen an Earthling since we landed. Scout 45 reports the same. The buildings look like they've been abandoned for years.\" \n\n\n\"Not a single Earthling? Not a hint of resistance? What's going on down there?\" \n\n\nThe scout paused, flipping through a small booklet with a picture of a large airship on the front. The general's eyes were glued to the booklet, satisfied in knowing the Earthlings at least attempted to make larger space-faring ships.... though puzzled at how they hadn't found any.",
        "An Atlantic Exclusive \n\nAn excerpt from \nFalling Forward: The Memoirs of President Mike Paulatowski. \n\nLet's be honest, I had no business being elected president. You know it and I know it. Pundits may refer to me as the Social Media President or the first populist president of the 21st century but in truth I was the first person to be upvoted to the Presidency. \n\nWhat brought us here? \n\"Mike Paulatowski needs you motherfuckers to vote!\" \n\nThe gag was simple enough. I gave a profanity laden address to an 8th grade school assembly, with a megaphone, demanding that \"you motherfuckers need to vote for me, cause I will CLEAN - SHIT - UP!\" I think the real thing that took it viral was the reaction of the kids. They thought it was hilarious. A grown man acting like a crazy person and trying to get elected to be the class president. They got the joke, the rest of you clearly did not. \n\nAnd then came the follow up videos. They were a hit and I was famous. Everything was cool. \n\nSoon reddit got a hold of it and sexybeeffarts45 started that god damned write in campaign. At the time I was foolish and just ran with it. And then there I was getting sworn in. \n\nA lot of so-called political professionals like to say that there was a simplicity to the message of \"cleaning shit up\" or that I captured the Zeitgeist. Those people are full of shit. Americans were just fed up with a political system that wasn't working for them anymore and decided to send a clown to DC. Too bad we got rid of the electoral college, that could've prevented this sort of thing from happening. \n\nMy dad always told me winners never quit and quitters never win but he never said anything about getting fired. And Lord knows I tried. \n\nFirst I used the provisions of the Patriot Act II to declare war on Canada. I figured nobody would want to go to war with Canada because they're so nice. I figured wrong. Oil companies thought it was a fantastic idea. It was a short war. Nine days. The price of oil plummeted and the economy grew by double-digit percentages. \n\nNext I decided to make an ass of myself at my first state of the Union address. I gave a three word speech. \"Fuck All Y'all\". Overnight my approval rating jumped 15 points. They called it \"refreshing\". \n\nWith nothing working, I concluded that I would have to come up with something that everyone would agree was horrifying. The end of social security. Who could possibly support this? I did succeed in trashing my approval ratings at first.",

        "I momentarily lose grip of the steering wheel as the truck bounces on the dirt track, before quickly tightening my grip and continuing forward with the headlights blaring ahead of me. I chuckle to myself thinking, two fucking tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and this is the shit I'm doing? Using the skills I was trained to use for the'greater good' against low life street thugs who've gotten on the wrong side of the wrong people? Pfft,'Pays good' I say to myself as I throw my cigarette out the window, seeing the truck ahead in the distance, waiting ominously in the field. \n\nI hear whoever this guy is in the truck moving about, attempting to cry for help with the duct tape over his mouth, \n\n\"ITS NO USE KID, STOP STRUGGLING, IT'LL BE DONE SOON\" I shout back to him. \n\nThey always do struggle I think to myself, survival and fear is a powerful cocktail when somebody realises they might not live to see tomorrow. I flash the headlights on and off twice as I always do, and whoever this thug is does the same. Just a precaution in case some hillbillies driving around at this time and mistakes this truck as someone who needs help, I chuckle to myself, now THAT would be a worst case scenario for a do-gooder. \n\nAs the truck slows to a halt, I open the door and hop out to light up another smoke, letting the sweet taste of Marlboro Red consume my lungs to help calm me down, it always has, and always will. \n\n\"YOU READY?\" the man shouts from the other truck. \n\n\"Hang on\" I shout back before taking another pull of the smoke, \"Just needa get my gun\". \n\nI open the glove compartment and voila, once again, same weapons been left in this stolen car for me, a specialised Glock with a suppressor, whoever wants this guy in the back dead must want him gone bad to have paid someone to steal this truck, kidnap this guy and give me this gun, doesn't matter to me who it is anyways, never has and never will. \n\nI open the trunk to sit this skinny looking fuck with a duffel bag over his head shaking, with the smell of urine suggesting to me he's pissed his pants, I hate it when they do that, cant stand the smell. I grab the guy by his neck and hoist him out, he doesn't seem to be struggling as much, just paralysed with fear I suppose, who wouldn't be, everyone's seen the movies, everyone knows the score. \n\n\"Signal out here is fucking awful right?\" says the thug as I throw the kid to the floor just outside the unmarked grave. \n\nI check mine, no bars. \"Agreed\" I say, ending the conversation quickly, they never do last long with these kinda guys anyways. \n\n\"Take off the bag and duct tape for the picture, I got ta take a quick piss\" I say to the thug, who nods back slowly as I run behind the truck and start peeing quickly, wanting to get out of this eerily quiet field and go find a cheap hooker back in town. \n\nI come back around and everythings off the kids head, and hes looking down at the floor with his.... oddly familiar brown hair.... no, you're not thinking straight, time to get this over with. \n\n\"Look up to the camera now\" I said sternly, I take out my phone once again and go to the camera, focused on it to load so I can take this picture. \n\n\"Tommy....tommy WHAT THE FUCK, TOMMY WHAT ARE YOU DOING\" the kid says, but this ain't no kid, this is Jonathan.",
        "I'd read about them.... The Otherlanders. What a nice story it had been. A man lost in between reality and technology who is stalked by a large short rotund and an eerily tall elegant thin. How nice this story is I had mused, what creativity it brings. \n\nThe story never left me though. Some thing about it became pegged to the back of my brain. Sitting there. Watching. I went back to my normal life, but some part of me stayed aware. I didn't realize it until the second or third time. \"Oh hey, look at that fat little man and that tall skinny man, that reminds me of the otherlanders\" I had been so ignorant. It continued though. Everywhere I went I began to notice their embodiment. In women, men, couples, creatures, but never acquaintances.... I never recognized them. Just their size relation. I'd never re - see them after I stole a glance, but they would return.

        "His eyes shot open and he sat up with a jolt. He had no idea why, it was just some sort of.... Instinct. He glanced around, confused. He had no idea where he was.... It was his room for sure, but at the same time, it wasn't. It wasn't the bare white walls lacking decoration with the mess of gaming consoles, controllers and miscellaneous wires as usual, his eyes were met with a much softer sight. Surprisingly familiar, even.... He could hear the rustling of the trees outside as the temperate wind lazily brushed through the leaves of the tree just outside, golden shafts of light shimmering into the room through the open blinds, wonderfully illuminating the flowered wallpaper adorning each of the walls. His childhood home.... He knew it had to be.... After all, this wallpaper wasn't any normal wallpaper, his mother made it herself! He had vague, yet fond memories of watching her cheerily paint each individual flower when he was just a few years old. A far better time that was, before all of the non-fatal, yet crippling diseases that life apparently thought his parents deserved, and all the financial troubles that came from said diseases.... He slowly stood up, glancing down at the plush carpet beneath his feet, and even wriggling his toes slightly just for the sake of getting a better feel for the softness of it. After taking a quick glance around to better appreciate the beauty of the room, he made his way over to the window, pulling up the blinds and looking outside. He had to raise a hand to block the sun, it was clearly very early in the morning, likely under an hour after dawn, and the sun was casting a gorgeous golding glow over the wonderfully familiar suburban neighborhood that stood just outside. Part of him wanted to wake himself up to make sure this was actually a dream, part of him wanted to try and manipulate this dream, and part of him even tried to tell himself that there was something wrong here, that no dream should be this vivid.

        "\u201c The first law of Quantum Economics is that currency doesn't exist until it's observed. But how can that be, you might ask? How can money be observed if it doesn't exist until the moment of observation? Well, that's difficult to explain precisely, but at any given moment there is the potential for the generation of funds spontaneously out of the quantum foam. \u201d \n\n\u201c But sir, if money can be generated spontaneously, then why isn't it constantly appearing everywhere? \u201d \n\n\u201c That's a good question, Jennifer, and it leads us to the second law of Quantum Economics. Currency is generated and lost in reverse proportion to your awareness of it. This is why a bank account constantly monitored hemorrhages money, and why money always seems to find its way into your couch, where you're least expecting it. \u201d \n\n\u201c So are you saying we could just ignore our bank accounts and have infinite money? \u201d \n\n\u201c Ah yes, the obvious question. It would seem that way at first glance, but how many of you could really do that? Could you stop yourself from guessing, from wondering how much was left? Everyone knows how much money they have, except for the super rich, and they have their own problems. \u201d \n\n\u201c What kind of problems, sir? \u201d \n\n\u201c Quantum Tax. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed, remember? The energy to generate currency has to come from somewhere. Ever wonder why the rich are never happy? \u201d \n\n\u201c Are you saying that money is generated out of happiness? \u201d \n\n\u201c Well, sometimes. Emotions generate the energy we use to interact with the world. I mean, think about it, how much does apathy ever accomplish? The potential energy of a life filled with emotion is transmuted into the currency we use every day. But the sad truth is, in such conversions, energy is always lost. Any attempt to replace the lost emotions with currency will always fail. \u201d \n\n\u201c So are you saying money is a useless drain on us? \u201d \n\n\u201c A drain? Certainly. Useless, not necessarily.",

Faraz, I need your help.\" \n\n\"W-what is it, sir?\" \n\n\"Faraz I sense there's another Path in this room. Do you sense him? No, of course not, you're still young.",

Her eyes betrayed her exhaustion as she posted her ad. \n\n\"For sale: Baby shoes, never worn.\" \n\nShe struggled out of her chair and waddled into the bathroom. Carelessly, she turned the faucet knobs filling the bathtub with warm water. Jessica took off her wedding ring and opened the medicine cabinet, setting her ring on top of a bottle of prenatal vitamins as she revealed her hidden stash of cigarettes she's been hiding from her husband. \n\nShe had everything she needed in this bathroom to enjoy her last cigarette.

        "It was like nothing I'd ever seen - wind ripped branches from trees and shingles from the roof tops, throwing them *clattering* to the street like some mid-tantrum child. That's when the Layton's house caught fire. \n\nPoor man, he'd bought it only a year ago, and the agent hadn't even told him what happened to the previous tenant. What a mess. \n\nTo his credit, Layton was always yelling at the Davies' to keep their trees trimmed, but Andrew Davies wasn't much of a doer. By the time the fire department arrived, the whole south side of the street was painted in flames - my house included. There were clouds of smoke hanging above my bed. When I looked out of the window, I could see red and gold shadows dancing everywhere. \n\nI guess I was still a bit sleepy, because I don't remember how I ended up downstairs. \n\nThere was a crowd standing in front of the Davies' house. Andrew carried out his daughter, her head hanging limp over his thick, sweaty arms. I stepped forward to help him, but the firefighters were yelling at everyone to stay back. \n\nIn the back of the crowd, a man was chuckling. His ears were dirty, his brow was smudged with dirt - it was hard to see a single point on his body that looked like it wasn't covered in dirt. I couldn't put a name to the face, but I had no problem giving him a stern look. \n\nMy eye caught his, and the grin slid from his mouth. I turned back to the houses, listening to the crackle of burning timbers. A fresh wave of, I'm afraid to say, an almost *comfortable* heat rolled over me. For a brief moment, I thought about stepping closer to the blaze, until another fireman walked out- \n\nOut of *my* house. \n\nHe had a woman over his shoulder. He was running. He was breathing and hacking up smoke like a pipe furnace. She wasn't breathing much at all. \n\n\u201c Hehehe- \u201d I heard a stifled giggle from the man. \n\n\u201c What is *wrong* with you? \u201d I whispered to him, \u201c Can't you see how serious this is? \u201d \n\n\u201c I can see just fine, thank you! \u201d he chirped, \u201c But can *you? * \u201d \n\n\u201c What on *Earth* are you talking about? \u201d I said, giving him what I hoped was a hard stare. His face was purple and blue in the flame-light. At least, I assumed it was the flame-light that colored him so. I couldn't quite figure out who he was, but I was *sure* I had seen him before. \n\nHe smiled, and with my brow creased as far as it could crease, I asked, \u201c Have we met? \u201d \n\n\u201c Yes, we have. And unfortunately, we are meeting again. \u201d \n\n*Well, that's just rude, * I thought. I gave him a proper harumph, and turned my back. \n\nHe didn't seem to get the hint. He pointed over my shoulder, at the fireman carrying the woman from my house, \u201c Don't you know that woman? \u201d \n\nThere was a taunting lilt to his voice, and I could hear the laughter creeping back in. \n\n\u201c No, \u201d I said, \u201c It must be one of the neighbors.",
        "The Ballad of Mona Lisa by Panic! At The Disco \n___ \nMarilyn sat in the corner of the room, sunk into a red paisley armchair, painting her fingernails a deep burgundy that flirted with black. Each stroke of the brush was deliberate and intense, the glossy handle flashing in the low light that glinted off her teeth. Morgan watched from the bed, unsure of why she'd be smiling. He glanced about the room, counting three empty bottles of gin and a few more half empty. \n\n*What have I gotten myself into? * he asks himself. \n\n\"Shall we go?\" Marilyn asked from the corner, interrupting his dark thoughts. \"I'm ready to go.\" \n\n\"Let's go, then,\" He answered. \n\nThey took a car, sleek and black, to the ball. Morgan showed the forged invitation, his tie feeling like a snake tightening around his neck until the bouncer nodded and said \"Welcome, Mr. Strumford, enjoy the evening.\" \n\nMarilyn divorced herself from his arm as soon as they met the crowd, and disappeared. \"I'm going to powder my nose,\" she had said. Ha. Marilyn didn't even wear makeup most nights, and even then it was only lipstick and eye shadow. Still, she outshone every other woman in the room. If they were diamonds, then she was the moon, rarer and more precious than all of them put together. \n\nHe wandered to a circle of revelers, holding glasses of champagne in their perfect hands and making small talk amongst themselves. They parted to let him join, and Morgan became acutely aware that he was out of his depth here. \n\nHe was a businessman of sorts, dealing in small crimes and information. Enough to afford him a taste of the finer things, but never truly sink his teeth. These were the men who lazed, stuffed on caviar and cocaine in homes he couldn't afford to walk past, and yet Morgan was going to con them. \n\n\"Who might you be?\" asked the leader, tall and blonde with a perfect part and dazzling smile. Gianiss, a mob man and owner of two casinos. \n\nMorgan paused, remembering what Marilyn had told him. *Lie all you want, lie every word, but never give them enough to know who you are. Better known as a pretender than a thief. * \n\n\"I'm new in town, off the trains just a month ago. Looking to expand an empire.\" \n\n\"What sort of empire?\" Gianiss inquired. \n\n\"One I'm not ready to discuss in pleasant company,\" Morgan answered. \n\n\"Well, here's a bigshot. What do you think, fellas? Should we introduce ourselves to Mr...\" the question was heavy. If Morgan used one of his usual pseudonyms, there was a chance he'd be found. A name that they'd heard before, and he'd be quizzed on connections. What had Marilyn said? \n\n\"Stanford, no relation.\" \n\nThey welcomed him, then. They found a table and talked shop, staring at the beautiful women who walked past, pretending not to notice a table of rising mobsters and businessmen. \n\n\"Are any of them yours?\" Morgan asked Gianiss. \n\n\"I took it you had your own working girls, Stanford.\" \n\n\"For men of baser taste, absolutely. But you employ women for the likes of us, don't you?\" \n\nGianiss threw his head back and laughed. \"I guess no man comes to sin city to live a pious life, but I had hoped you were an exception.\" \n\n\"There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you've paid for.\" \n\nGianiss whistled with his fingers, and three women approached the table. \n\nMorgan kissed the hand of one with auburn hair and green eyes. \"What plans do you have for tonight, Miss?\" \n\nShe smiled, slightly too wide and whispered into his ear. Morgan blushed and rose from the table. \"I think I'll take my leave, gentlemen. It was great to meet you.\" \n\nShe lead him from the table and up the grand staircase. The party below went on.",

        "They say that if you've been forgiven for all your sins, when you die, you go to Heaven. Once there, you talk to the man upstairs aka God. \n\nWell what if God came down to you? \n\nI've worked for the NYPD for 15 years now and have solved countless crimes. From muggings in alleys to drunk barhoppers peeing on statues- I am the first detective mentioned when a crime happens. \n\nI woke up on a bright Sunday morning. The sun was high up and life just seemed good. My cup of Joe was hot. The radio was playing my favorite tunes. I was ready to take on the day. \n\nWhen I got into work, my task was hand written and laid on my desk. \n\nThe note read: \"Multiple religious scholars around the world have visions and dreams that God has left his post in Heaven to roam the Earth alongside humanity, making his temporary home in New York City. Track down the Almighty one and expose Him.\" \n\nWhat was strange is that the note was not addressed to me or anyone like our tasks usually are; it was only signed in illegible handwriting. \n\nI left the office and walked to the first place I expected to find God- church. I walked into the chapel and saw rows and rows of ordinary people, bowing their heads and praying. But there was no God, at least not in physical form. I left the church and walked down the street. \n\nMaybe God was in an alleyway feeding stray cats or helping cure an alcoholic? \n\nNothing. \n\nI kept searching. I tried to pick up on supernatural hints that the Lord was upon us. \n\nNothing. \n\nI decided to test my luck in the most unholy place I could think of; maybe God decided he needed to pay a visit. I walked down the sidewalk and down a flight of stairs. I was in the New York Subway Station. \n\nI purchased a ticket and walked to the boarding platform. It was dark in the tunnels and the people around me were still as hopeless as they had always been. It seemed like there was no holy touch here.... \n\nuntil a bright light appeared down the tracks.",
        "Humanity is an unremarkable species according to practically every single member of the Allied Planets. They weren't physically remarkable, their intelligence was just sufficient to have them classified as average, and they shared no unusual trait or talents that were of benefit of anyone. When first contact was made with them by the Hoto there were many who wondered if it was even worth the time to open formal relations. As such only the Hoto interacted with the humans on any regular basis, feeling that since they were the ones to show them that they were not alone in the galaxy, the last thing they wanted was to abandon them. \n\nNo one could imagine how this seemingly benign alliance would forever affect the galaxy. When a deposit of rare tililium was discovered on a remote Hoto colony near the Xig alliance, conflict erupted as the Xigs laid claim to the planet to control the tililium. The fighting was fierce, the Hotos were advance but where a single Hotian ship could contend against five Xigian, the Xigs had twenty times the numbers. The Hotos sought help from the Allied Planets, but the loss of a single colony was declared more desirable to the prospect of war. Humanity were the only ones to answer the call to arms. Though their military was no where near the strength of the Hotos, they would not abandon their friends. \n\nThe war was devastating, although as expected the Xigs were able to continue their conquest of Hotian space. It wasn't long before they had even conquered Hoton, the small white marble of snow and ice the Hotos called home. It was then that they turned their attention to Earth. Ignored throughout the conflict for it's insignificance, it was the only planet to accept the Hotian refugees and remained the final bastion of resistance. As expected the sol system defenses were easily defeated by the superior Xigs and the fleet entered Earth's orbit as conquers. The Xigs expected this to be their day of victory, the Hotos however remember it as the day the phrase \"Never push the pink-skins to the thin ice\" was first uttered. \n\nWhat humanity lacked in abilities compared to the other races in the galaxy they more than made up for in their tenacity. When the first Hotos refugees arrived at Earth they immediately set to work to help the earthlings strengthen their defenses.",
        "\"You realize what this means, don't you?\" A shadowy figure spoke from its perch ten feet above Commander Uzyk. \"Humanity at large is losing hope. The outer walls of the Sanctum fell last month, and even the citadel can not hope to survive long. And with this news -\" \n\n\"I acknowledge that the situation is dire,\" she replied, \"but -\" \n\n\"No. There is no other alternative. When the existence of life itself is threatened, those with the means to act must do so.\" \n\n\"Who said that? Hitler?\" \n\n\"Who?\" \n\n\"Sorry. I used to read the ancient histories.\" She shuddered as an explosion far away rocked the ground underneath her. Crates of food and weapons crashed to the ground, and the failing fluorescent lights flickered a few times more. \"Listen, the Council will never stand for your solution. And neither will I. We will fight to the death, but we won't sacrifice our principles.\" \n\nThe shapeless form laughed harshly. \"You think your moral stand will be remembered for all of time. But who will do the remembering?\" It leaped from outcropping in the wall and stood next to her, still no more solid. \"I will do this with or without your approval. Do not get in my way.\" \n\nIt strode to a small door in the wall, and began pressing buttons on an keypad. As it did so, Uzyk scrabbled around on the floor, at last grasping a discarded bottle of some substance. She turned it over and read the date: 10/02/151441. \"It reads today,\" she spat. \"This is the last one. Our final hope. It's dead and gone. As are we all.\" \n\nThe darkness turned towards her for a moment, and it seemed to almost pity her, before pressing a final button. The door swung open, revealing -- \n\nA storeroom packed with thousands of containers labeled \"Corn Syrup.\" \n\nUzyk gasped and fell to her knees. Shaking, she drew a gun from her belt and aimed it unsteadily at the blackness. \"You have doomed us all,\" she murmured. \n\n\"It is time to embrace the new way, Commander. No longer can Maple Syrup sustain us.",

        "There was once a man, he said that if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. So I gazed into the marble as if it was the abyss. I could only look at it from afar as every other curious observer did. But it never gazed at me back, could it be there were too many others so it would gaze at me? I was not special, surely I was not, and only the special could take a closer look. There were even other, so special, the chosen they called them. Not very intricate name if you ask me, but the name very descriptive as they were indeed chosen. No one did know how and why the chosen were chosen, but they were and that was all that mattered. I would visit the marble every evening after work, like it was my dear friend. My dearest friend, it who would not even look at me. But I looked at it, and that was enough. I once felt, I think I did. It looked at me, for the shortest of times it looked at me. That night I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat the day after not until I saw it again. The marble, nothing special about it, but had you did place any other in its place, I would know, they would know. We all would know. The time passed, but the marble never looked at me again. I was never special, I was never chosen, but I was old. So much time I've spent looking at it, only one look it gave back. My last days were near, I felt it deep down I think even the marble felt it. I went to see it one last time. Too see the marble that looked at me once. One last gaze I gave it and I turned my back. I walked slowly again, and then I heard the noise. The sound of the marble hitting the ground resonated, everyone was quiet in an instant. The sound that made the silence. Then I saw it, slowly rolling towards me. It stopped at my feet, I noticed my worn off shoes, it must have been a long time since I got a new pair. I picked up the marble, gently, holding back the tears. My whole life I waited for that. I squeezed the marble and I closed my eyes. Is that what happiness feels like?",
        "\"Dude, Freja's going to kill you,\" Heimdall called over the open air wave. He'd been searching for hours and Loki was nowhere to be found. \"Odin forbid, Loki, you know I don't have time for this horse shit, she needs that necklace!\" \n\nCackling answered him over the intercom, \"I know! She's never gon na get to the Asgard on time!\" Loki's laughter was tattooing itself against Heim's ears. \n\nHeimdall's ship was equipped with the best perception filters white light could produce, but fuck it if Loki didn't have a way around EVERYFUCKINGTHING. He had skirted the Baltic and was heading toward the open Atlantic when an idea sprung to mind. \n\n\"Fuckit,\" he called, plunging into the ocean. If there was one thing Loki didn't know how to modulate, it was aquatic frequencies. He brought up the outer shield menu and scrolled through the local fauna, \"No, no, fuck no, what's that? Seal, perfect,\" he said, highlighting the grey little water dog. He slid the ship onto a rock, setting the behavioral circuits to'Lounge'. \n\nIf he was lucky, the excess water would fuck with the Trickster's sensors long enough to...... \n\nA fly began to zip out across the water, stopping a thousand feet offshore from where Heimdall sat. \"Clever little bitch,\" he sighed. He tended to exclude insects from the ships filters, too many of the little shits to keep track of constantly. He began to monitor the airwaves, waiting for...... \n\n\"Dumbass,\" Heimdall could hear the smile spread across Loki's lips as he sighed his usual signoff, and no sweeter pleasure could be had than when he hit the fly with a frequency jammer. The ship burst to it's proper size, throwing the inhabitant all ajumble, \"Sonofabitch!\" \n\nIt was Heimdall's turn to smile a deliciously vengeful smile, snapping the energy locks on the engines. \"Give it, jackass. She needs the apple or the atmosphere is going to kill her.\" \n\nLoki was pouting, still slumped haphazardly against a wall, \"Did I say you could come on board?\" \n\n\"Cut the shit.\" \n\n\"You really think I would have let her die?\" A false masque of horror and heartbreak spread across his face. He slid the wroght gold and crystal necklace from an inside pocket and tossed it at the Watchman. \n\n\"I think you're jackass enough to try,\" Heimdall curled his nose at the little man before him. \"How you became Blood-Kin to Odin only the Fates know.\" He reboarded his ship, making sure to rough up Loki a bit as he released the energy lock. \"One week banishment, no parole.\" \n\n\"A bit much, don't you think?\" \n\n\"*YOU BLEW UP HER SHIP AND STOLE HER TRANSPORTER LOCK!

What did I come here to do? The wall was white. Was it always white? As if that simple thought was the most important command, the wall transformed into a glittering array of colors.

        "\"No, sah. Not here.\" \n\nFrowning, I glanced over at Attenib. I'd heard a wobble in the man's voice that I didn't recognize. He didn't sound quite like himself. \n\n\"Atten, everything okay?\" I asked in a lowered tone, taking a step closer to him. Damnable insects swooped down at my face, biting and stinging. I managed to smack one, and watched with vicious satisfaction as it slammed into a nearby tree trunk and then dropped, stunned, to the forest floor. \n\nI returned my attention back to my guide. After years alongside Attenib, I knew his moods well, recognized the minor twitches of the muscles beneath his nut-brown skin. I'd worked with him long enough to trust in his uncanny ability to know just where to dig. \n\nBut now, today, he looked nervous, pale despite his leathery, tanned hide. And when he looked back at me, I saw a glint of unexpected emotion in his eyes. \n\nFear. \n\n\"Is this the wrong place to dig?\" I asked again. I stood near him, almost shoulder to shoulder despite the oppressive, humid heat of the jungle. I'd called a halt, so our porters huddled several steps behind, taking shelter in the shade of a large palm. \n\nAgain, Attenib shook his head. \"Right place,\" he said softly. \"But wrong feeling. Not good to dig here.\" \n\nI took a moment to weigh his words. I truly believed that Attenib appreciated our arrangement, that he harbored no resentment towards my ownership of him. After all, I'd treated him far better than his fellows, snapped up on the bidding block to work the fields until their muscles and bodies failed them. But I'd seen his talent, and he'd served me well. \n\nBut we sat on our laurels too long, as I basked in the attention of the Royal Society and failed to note the new naturalists nipping at my heels. I'd secured the funding for this expedition, but one of the Senior Fellows had drawn me aside and warned me that, without results, it would be my last. \n\nI looked again at Attenib. Did he know the conflict in my head? He just looked back, waiting. \n\nI made my decision. \n\n\"Men! Gather your tools!\" I shouted to the hired porters. \"You lot! Axes, to clear the area! You others, picks and shovels! This is the spot!\" \n\nAttenib said nothing, but I saw him shrink back towards the camp. I should have disciplined him, I knew, but I chose to let him go. I had a dig to supervise. \n\nAnd soon, Attenib's almost supernatural talent proved itself once again, as one of the porters let out a cry of surprise. \"Sah! Over here!\" \n\nI hurried over to the man, roughly pushing him aside before he could damage the delicate artifact. But my words died away as I stared, open mouthed, at the object. \n\nSilver metal, curved, suggesting a large cylinder. Rivets in regular lines showed where the plates were anchored together. A hatch, the glass obscured with dust and dirt. And a logo of some sort, a square of blue with white dots, next to red and white stripes. It looked like a flag, albeit one I'd never seen before. \n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, utterly confused. \n\nFrom nearby, Attenib let out another soft moan. \"Evil,\" he answered me. \"Not from this place. It doesn't belong.\" \n\nI bent closer, wiping away more dirt. I saw words, now, stamped on the metal. \"Apollo,\" I read. \"What could that be?\" \n\nUnnoticed, Attenib shrank back, in amid the trees that reminded him of his childhood when he'd laughed and run between their trunks. His master continued to puzzle over the alien thing that he'd felt in the ground, but Attenib could stand here no longer. \n\nWith other objects, he felt their history. That drew him to those hidden beneath the earth, feeling for their long histories, disrupted but to be resumed once unearthed. It became almost beyond notice, the history of all around him, all he touched. \n\nBut this object had no history at all. \n\nAnd as his master found the handle, reached for it, Attenib turned and fled into the trees. He ran blindly, not to anywhere, but just to get *away. * \n\n***** \n\n*Note: this was written on my phone while my SO tries on clothes, so please forgive any spelling/autocorrect errors! *",
        "Janice scratched her butt lazily as she stared at the tall cloaked man in the hallway. She gave him a good look over through her disheveled black hair, taking note of the snow dripping on her doorway, and her eyes momentarily paused on cloven hoofs peaking out from under the hem surrounded by a growing puddle. Odd considering it was New York City in July. But hell, she wasn't a meteorologist. \n\nShe stretched and yawned, and turned away, closing the door sleepily. It was only 2 p.m. and way too early for whatever this guy was trying to sell. \"Sorry, I am not interested.\" \n\nA hoof wedged forward to prevent the door from closing, and a red hand with large claws pushed the door forward. Goat eyes stared down into Janice's annoyed ones. \"What the fuck. Get out.\" The slim girl shoved her shoulder against the door, but it didn't budge against the monster's strength. \"I told you I am not interested.\" \n\nA hiss escaped from the creature's mouth. \"What did you do Janice?\" \n\n\"I don't know. I do know right now I am trying to get your ass out of my apartment. Get out or I am calling the cops!\" \n\nThe monster laughed, \"Cops? Cops? Do you know who I am?\" The heavy wooden door suddenly dissolved into heated ash. Janice stood there momentarily, awkwardly realizing a door no longer stood between her and her intruder. \n\nWith a small, frustrated noise, she dropped the door knob into the crumbling dust of her door and strode into the kitchen. \"Whatever. You are paying for that door. It was.... at least $ 3000. Yeah, that sounds right.\" \n\n\"What? That door was only $ 800 tops. Where did you get a number like-\" He paused, and shook his head angrily, \"No, it doesn't matter. I am here because you ruined Hell. It's like Christmas down there.\" \n\nJanice stomped back into the room, holding a bottle of whiskey. \"Ya don't say. How did little old mortal me do that?\" She took a swig before pouring a glass. She glanced back at the monster. \"You aren't getting any.\" \n\n\"I don't care. I followed the clues-\" \n\n\"Ah, a good ol' fashioned Nancy Drew...\" \n\n\"AND I believe you are behind Hell freezing over.\" \n\nJanice rolled her eyes and gestured impatiently in his general direction.",
        "50 years is a long time, enough time to go crazy and return sane. \n\nI remember before it happened, the [ CDC joked that they would have a cure \"within a week\" ] (http: //www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm) when they hadn't been able to cure HIV in 32 years, they had known about herpes for 2385 years and only had a treatment, and the flu remained a menace up until there weren't enough humans left to contract it. To the credit of the scientists, they all worked until the only thought they had was about their brain cravings. \n\nI had had a new \"stem cell\" treatment the year before, it helped recover some of the nerve damage I had gotten when I was young and had to have a surgery to correct a malformation. In those days, it seemed that the end to all disease and disfigurement were just around the corner, technology and biology hand in hand to save the human race. The funny thing is, my only guess to my resistance to the zombie infection and the zombies total lack of interest in me is probably due to the stem cell treatment somehow. \n\nThe outbreak didn't take long, it started with a HIV like infection where only if you were bitten or zombie bodily fluids came in contact with someone, only then could you be infected. The virus became symbiotically linked to a bacterial group, then also a mold. With new methods of transmission, only the people on the ISS were safe from infection.... They got to starve to death and have a front row seat to the end of the world. \n\nBy the time the infection made it here, there was no time for panic. The mold set itself up inside of buildings and anything made of wood or anywhere with standing water... by the time it was identified, it had infected everyone. It's spread was attributed to standing water in the water traps of sinks and toilets and their connection to the sewage system. time from infection to zombie was about 6 hours, and was mostly flu like. some people simply fell asleep never to wake with a human thought again. \n\nThe thing about zombies that most zombie movies neglect is thermodynamics. Zombies don't eat other zombies, and most animals can flee zombies or are immune. This means that a zombie must consume material to continue locomotion, and that energy must be expended to remain \"alive\". Once the zombie's guts had rotten past usability, a zombie would only be able to live for about 32 hours. Given that the zombie would run out of ATP fairly quickly, they would spend most of that time too stiff to move. This meant that anyone who was smart enough to remain out of sight, would be able to survive. The actual \"zombie apocalypse\" lasted about 3 years. \n\nYear two I went a bit crazy, I went through a mental breakdown where I assumed I myself must be a zombie and joined a horde. We chased some wildlife, and ate the remains of some survivors that starved to death. It was the sight of that rotting family that snapped me out of it, I slipped away and let the horde... do their thing.... \n\nbut that was 48 years ago, with eternal youth and a city of books and movies you can learn to do anything. So I learned to do pretty much everything. I wasn't going to die anytime soon, I had a garden and traps set up within year 4. So it was easy to learn to make and do everything. \n\nOne of the things I did was set up a \"mesh network\", reprogramming WiFi routers to make a city-wide network that could allow me to monitor and automate things.",
        "Titan pursed his lips as the Hadron collider powered down. \n\n\"Hmm,\" he mused. \"That's all?\" He looked down at the trembling \"scientists\" that came only to his waist. Their fleshy exterior and poorly-constructed internal skeletons disgusted him, and their meager attempts at fusion and fission had barely scratched the surface of their potential, even after a few thousand years of discovering how to harness the power of fire. \n\nDr. Ashe stammered and muttered some reply, but Titan merely scribbled on his clipboard, turned on his heel, and walked away. \n\nHe called over his shoulder, \"looks like low 800,000s, if you're lucky. Anything less than 850,000 gets selected for harvesting!\" he chuckled to himself. That would get them quaking. \n\nHonestly he was rather disgusted with the squabbles and petty rivalries this world had to offer. He mused to himself as he wove through the crowd of onlookers who'd gathered to take his picture. They didn't even have holographic photo-3D mapping, for Ublar's sake! \n\nThe sea of meatbags parted before him, their eyes widening in fear as his sleek armored legs shook the ground beneath their feet. He nearly fell over, however, when a small human child, no more than 7 years old, by his estimation, didn't move out of his way. He looked down angrily, prepared to berate the small boy, but refrained as the boy pulled something from the crinkled blue bag and offered it to Titan. \n\n*Hmph*, he scoffed. No mere gifts or trinkets would sway his decision. He was a professional, and there was nothing, *nothing* that had thus far distinguished the people of this planet in *any* way whatsoev-..... \n\nTitan's eyes widened as the cookie was placed in his hand."

        "The world used to be simple.  I remember leaving my parents' home, venturing out to build my own quiet dwelling by the water. Land was plentiful then. Finding a companion, raising children \u2013 life followed a familiar, comforting cycle.\n\nDisruptions were occasional, not constant. A flood might wash away homes, fire might force a move, a neighbor might disappear without a trace. Sometimes the communal alarm would sound, warning of an approaching danger, a bolt from the blue in an otherwise tranquil sky. But mostly, life was easy, touched by fortune.\n\nThen came the fear, the uncertainty.  They came.\n\nI remember vividly the first time terror gripped me.  Gathering food for my family, I stumbled upon the body of a neighbor.  We\u2019d recently quarreled, a fierce argument fueled by his unwanted advances toward my wife. I would have killed him myself had he touched her, but this\u2026 this was something else. His skin was flayed from his body. I stood there, struggling to comprehend the horrific sight, when my daughter\u2019s scream ripped through the air.  She was caught in a trap, pleading for help.  And then I saw them. Two giants, their movements alien and unsettling, casually approaching my terrified child.  One pointed at me, uttering something in a language I didn\u2019t understand. The other raised a strange object. A crack, sharp as the communal alarm, followed by an eruption of pain in my leg.  I glanced at the wound, unbelieving.  I ran. I abandoned my daughter. I ran until I reached the safety of my home, where my remaining family tended my wounds.\n\nWeeks have passed since that day.  Their presence has spread.  No longer confined to the water's edge, their massive structures now dominate the landscape, stretching as far as the eye can see. They continue their inexplicable campaign of slaughter, and I rarely venture out anymore.  All I can do is hope, desperately, that their departure will be as sudden as their arrival.",
        "Mike interrupted the court proceedings. \u201cYour Honor,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cI plead guilty.\u201d  He realized, with a chilling sense of self-awareness, that he was just as insane as his daughter.  He couldn't bear to listen to any more testimony; the courtroom drama faded as his mind returned to the true events of that night.\n\nIt was early summer evening, the sky just beginning to darken. Spaghetti noodles were boiling on the stove, and Mike was sorting through bills at the kitchen table. His daughter, Cathy, was playing outside. He called her through the window, and after a second unanswered call, panic propelled him out of the house.\n\nHe found Cathy curled into a ball on the side of the road. Dark red spots pooled on the asphalt, drawing his eye to the skid marks and a '79 Cutlass in the ditch. The driver was nowhere in sight.  His mind raced as he ran to Cathy's side. \u201cCat, Little Cat,\u201d he cried, turning her over. \u201cCathy? Can you hear me?\u201d\n\nSlowly, one green eye opened. She looked at him and smiled. Relief washed over him; she was alive. But the blood!  His stomach lurched.  Clutched tightly to Cathy's body was their cat, Pancakes.  Limp and broken.  The blood was the cat\u2019s. Cathy, he realized, must have witnessed the accident and run to Pancakes, trying to protect him even in death.\n\nHe gently took the blood-soaked cat from Cathy and told her to go back to the house and turn off the stove.  He retrieved a shovel from the garage and walked towards the public trail entrance near the abandoned Cutlass.  Preoccupied with digging a small grave in the woods, he hadn\u2019t initially found it odd that the driver had vanished.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nMr. Kim rose, his eyes widening as realization struck. The weight of his legacy\u2014his own crimes, his father's, his grandfather's\u2014crashed upon him. They were the world's most reviled tyrants, simultaneously feared and mocked, their nation a cruel joke on the global stage. Retreating to a corner of the cave, he crumpled, wracked with sobs.\n\nDeath wasn't an option\u2014the rules forbade it. Wishing his grandfather's non-existence would create an impossible paradox; he wouldn't exist to make the wish in the first place. He couldn't erase the past, nor could he deny it. Wiping tears from his face, he approached the genie with newfound resolve.\n\n\"I wish for the people of North Korea to have the strength and knowledge to rebel against the government.\"\n\nThe genie gestured, and the countryside erupted with revolutionary fervor. From the cave's entrance, Kim watched as fires bloomed across the landscape, the people arming themselves with whatever they could find.\n\n\"You know,\" the genie mused, \"they'll gut you like a pig.\"\n\n\"No, they won't.\"\n\n\"How do you figure?\"\n\nKim steepled his fingers. \"Though I now recognize my crimes, intelligence doesn't equate to morality. Isn't that right?\"\n\n\"I don't concern myself with morality\u2014I'm a genie. People always request immoral things!\"\n\n\"I thought as much. So, I wish to become an emaciated Korean woman.\"\n\nThe genie's expression fell as he granted the wish with a wave.\n\n\"What now?\" he asked, curiosity evident in his voice.\n\n\"I'm going to take revenge on those who convinced me I was benevolent.\"\n\nWith that, the former dictator\u2014now transformed\u2014stepped out into the burning meadows below, joining the throng of starving, angry citizens marching toward Pyongyang.",
        "Here\u2019s a restructured version of your text to improve its flow and coherence:\n\n---\n\nI loved the feeling of the cool night air drifting through my open window. Leaning against the windowsill, I stared up at the stars, softly singing *Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star*. My eyes lingered on the biggest star I could see, its bright light standing out against the velvet darkness of the sky. But as I repeated the song, something strange happened. The star seemed to grow *bigger*. Bigger and bigger, until its light flooded my entire room, illuminating every corner. \n\nThen, just as quickly, the brightness dimmed, fading to a soft, smooth glow. I blinked, the shapes of the room returning, and the glow took form, leaving the silhouette of a humanlike figure outside my window. I froze, the cool, still night air the only sound, until the figure spoke, its voice gentle, almost musical, cutting the silence, \"Hello? Where am I?\"",
        "David sat down at the bar in the ballroom, even though he knew drinking wouldn't help him. Around him, workers buzzed like bees, preparing for the most joyous and wonderful union about to take place. It was supposed to be a day of utmost perfection, but David's head was pounding harder now than when he had woken up six hours ago, two hours late for the groomsman photos his best friend had insisted would not proceed without him.\n\n\"Fucking Gatorade,\" he muttered under his breath. \n\n\"Only got the regular kind, Jack,\" said an approaching bartender. David hated bartender talk.\n\nWithout looking up, he responded, \"Whiskey, double, clean.\" The bartender nodded and swiftly prepared the drink, delivering it quicker than David had anticipated. Normally, choosing to drink was like a fork in the road for David, but today, he saw only one path with many drinks along the way. He would either numb the pain or let it spill out of him in a drunken slur; it was up in the air.\n\n\"That'll be 18 buckaroos, buckaroo,\" the bartender said. David looked at him but said nothing. It was supposed to be an open bar, a gift from the bride's father's grave, courtesy of the trust fund he left her. The thought brought back a sting from the night before.\n\n'What kind of idiot sends a 200-dollar wreath to a headstone?' he thought to himself, pathetically. 'The same kind who spends the night watching the Keira Knightley-Rick scenes from \"Love Actually\" on a drunken loop,' he answered himself.\n\nDavid needed a change of subject, but the weed he had smoked before arriving for the photos\u2014hoping to cover up his hangover\u2014was backfiring. Instead of dulling his headache and relaxing him, it had left him swimming in an ocean of tortured thoughts. 'What a poetic motherfucker,' he thought. 'Shakespeare would shit himself.'\n\nThe bartender returned just as the whiskey was beginning to take effect. Noticing David's empty glass, he prepared to refill it. \"I thought the bar was open... asshole,\" David said, his anger swirling within him. The bartender, unfazed, replied, \"Open for the reception. Do you see a reception going on in here... asshole?\" with a slight edge in his voice. \n\n'He better watch his ass or I'll use that edge to slit his throat,' David thought maliciously.",
        "I close my eyes and sigh. Maybe this time when I speak, things will be different. Another epic failure in communications. It wasn't my fault. It was *him* -- always *him*. \"Silence, you imbecile, or I, the great Dr. Demento shall eradicate your spleen with my ray of evil cosmic death.\"\n\n\"Boss, we need to go,\" Boris tells me. \"They're coming.\" \"Uh.... sure boss. Sorry,\" Boris says. \"Look, we really need to get out of here. I mean, we had no business being here in the first place.\"\n\nI watch as the first police offer shows up. He gets out of his car and before a word of warning, points his gun straight at my head. He radios in. \"Guys, we have Dr. Demento again. I'll need all the back up I can. Is Ultra Boy available? Someone light the Ultra beacon.\" I shake my head. Not Ultra Boy again.\n\nEver since I made that deal for money and power, I've been a prisoner to my own tongue and fashion sense. I'm so tired of this -- so very damn tired. Perhaps this time, I won't deflect the bullet. I close my eyes and think of where things went so terribly wrong. \"Boss!\" I hear Boris scream. I open my eyes just in time to see my loyal henchman jump in front of the bullet. His eyes widen as the bullet tears through his abdomen. He crumples to the ground.\n\nAbove, I hear a voice. \"Dr. Demento -- I should have known it was you again. Your plot to summon a Kaiju monster has failed.\" It's Ultra Boy, cracking his pair of eager fists. \"Are you ready?\" I drop the body of faithful Boris to the ground and then pull out my cosmic death ray. I stare at Ultra Boy with rage in my eyes, and then at the police officer who shot him.\n\nFine, if the world sees me as a villain, then so be it. I let out a hellish scream and then proceed to murder the city I once sought to protect. Somewhere in the hollows of my eardrums, amongst the sound of raging battle and torn appendages, I can hear *him* laughing. \"Boss.... though you've.... you've always been a dick to me.... I see the truth. I see.... I see what's in your heart. Love is...\" and then he's gone. Boris, sweet Boris, the only one who listens to my actions instead of my words.\n\nNo, Boris. What have you done? Why did you do this? I kneel down and cradle him in my arms.

Though it's better when someone else is cooking, even when I'm reluctantly in charge, the moment bacon meets hot pan, the world transforms. As the strips sizzle and pop, their aroma wafts through the kitchen, coaxing a smile from my lips. Through the open window, spring birds flit and dance, making the morning seem perfect.\n\nI retrieve eggs from the refrigerator and crack them into the pan after setting aside the crispy bacon. The initial crackle settles into a gentle hiss as I season them with a sprinkle of salt and freshly ground pepper. By the time my simple feast is ready, anticipation has my mouth watering. I sit down eagerly, fork poised.\n\nBut as soon as the egg touches my tongue, consciousness crashes in\u2014hurling me back into my horrific reality. The dank basement materializes around me. The gag between my teeth muffles any sound I might make, and when my eyes fall to the mutilated stump where my hand once was, tears begin to flow.",
        "Love is a clich\u00e9 for a reason \u2013 it hurts.  It truly does.  This pain is especially acute when your love isn't reciprocated.  You find yourself crying in the shower as the realization hits you with the force of a ton of bricks: they will never feel about you the way you need them to.  Meanwhile, they continue with their life, seemingly oblivious to the turmoil they've caused. They act as though they can remain a part of your world, even though the mere sight or thought of them continues to break your heart.  Confessing your feelings isn't an option. It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to them.  The potential rejection, or worse, their pity, would be crushing.\n\nBut despite this unbearable pain, we keep searching for love.  We keep going because of moments like the first kiss \u2013 that awkward, heart-racing, body-tingling mess of a moment.  We yearn for the first time their hand reaches for yours, and you can't help but smile.  It's the feeling of their kiss on your shoulder in the middle of the night, a silent reassurance of their presence.  It's waking up next to them and wanting to stay in that moment forever.",

His personal staff, a group of young men, lay lifeless, surrounded by pools of their own blood, victims of fatal bullet wounds. Among them, one man stood out, seemingly having endured a different, more gruesome fate, with burn marks covering his arms and neck. Amidst this grim scene, I found him, clutching a blood-covered book, a bullet hole piercing directly between his eyes. It was frustrating, to say the least, that he took the satisfaction of justice away from us, opting instead to end his own life, a cowardly escape from the consequences of his actions.\n\nCurious, I flipped through the pages of the book, wondering what a scumbag like him could possibly cherish, even in his final moments, before choosing a coward's exit.",

Honking horns, blaring radios, airplanes soaring overhead\u2014it was overwhelming. One night, I visited an Indian casino. It was just endless rows of clanking, flashing, singing slot machines. I couldn't bear it. I went into the bathroom and cried like a baby. The very next day, I sold my Honda Accord, bought an old 4Runner, and ventured into the deep, blue woods. I can't believe that was six years ago.\n\nI had a cabin, which was essentially just four walls, a roof, and a wood stove. The deer were plentiful, and I fished in a nearby stream. For the most part, I was content.\n\nEvery three months, I\u2019d head into town to stock up on essentials. Occasionally, I\u2019d spend the night with Lucy, whom I, of all places, met at Walmart.

And now, here he was, sitting in a hospital bed, having awoken from a 40-year coma. He was apparently the winner of a \"Pass the Potassium\" radio contest right before his accident, with the prize being a lifetime supply of bananas. The radio station, unsure of the legal obligations of supplying a lifetime supply of anything to a man in a coma, had been sending a banana each week to the hospital for the past 40 years.\n\nDave, peeling the latest banana, grumbled, \"Guess I should have woken up sooner, then.\" His head was hurting, and the whole situation felt like a bad dream.\n\n\"What about Lucy?\" Dave, feeling hungry, inquired, \"How is my sister?\" The response was, \"I'm sorry, sir, but she passed away a few years ago, from cancer, I believe, but she did a lot of good, founding humanitarian and animal-rights causes, one of which, the American Penguin Society, she bequeathed to you, to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",

Why, indeed? \n\nHad he been taught how to do it? Was it a result of a bad upbringing that drove him to murder? Doubtful. Toby had lived a life of luxury ever since he was brought home. He had received affection from his family and offered it back in spades. There weren't any real unhappy moments, as far as he could remember. He certainly didn't do it out of desperation, as he had all the food, drink, and company anyone could ever hope for. \n\nWas it to protect what was rightfully his? Again, that wasn't the right answer. Toby and his family didn't face any major threats. There were occasional accidents on the nearby roads, but those were out of his control. They had no real enemies, at least none that posed a real danger. Besides, Toby kept a lookout, watching over the neighbors, ensuring that nothing strange happened. Mrs. Jenkins, the neighbor across the road, had passed away a few months ago, but that had nothing to do, probably, with him. Maybe. \n\nHe shook his foot, trying to stop the itch, caused by the sun, which was slowly creeping up his leg, as he pondered. \n\nThe question, however, remained. Why?

He was oblivious to the businessman\u2019s rising frustration.\n\n\"I said, what do you mean you're not going to make a toy for my son this year?

If he doesn't respect toys, he gets no toys!\"  His anger flared, followed by a wracking cough. \"LEAVE!\" he rasped, before collapsing, clutching his throat.\n\nHe choked, his face turning purple, one arm reaching out to the businessman in a silent plea for help.  The businessman simply watched, a cruel smile twisting his lips.  He observed without remorse as the toy maker struggled, each gasp more desperate than the last. When the old man finally lay still, the businessman retrieved his hat, pocketed the finished toy soldier, and left.\n\n\nLater that night, young Jimmy played with his new toy \u2013 a British soldier, resplendent in a red coat and tall black hat.  It was his favorite of the gifts he'd received.\n\n\"Time for bed, son,\" his father said from the doorway.\n\nJimmy, engrossed in play, grimaced.  \"Okay, Dad,\" he grumbled, reluctantly placing his new treasures in the toy chest. He lingered over the soldier, a frown creasing his brow.\n\n\"Enjoy your new friend there?\" his father asked.\n\n\"Yeah, he's cool and all\u2026 but\u2026\" Jimmy hesitated.\n\n\"But what, son?\"\n\n\"Why does he look so angry at me?\"",
        "The old man\u2019s gaze, intense and unwavering, bore into Jim.  It felt like an eternity under the scrutiny of those eyes, wise with nearly three-quarters of a century. The silence stretched, taut and painful. With each tick of the clock, Jim\u2019s hope dwindled, the sense of impending doom growing stronger. When the old man finally spoke, his voice was a harsh rasp.\n\n\"You fucked up, Jimbo.\"\n\nJim nodded, speechless.  There was no denying it. He had.\n\n\"We went over it three times. All you had to do was wait for the guys, then drive away when they got in the car.\"\n\nJim nodded again, starting to speak, but the old man\u2019s hand lashed out with a speed that belied his age, striking Jim\u2019s mouth.  A searing pain shot through Jim\u2019s head, and he winced.  The old man settled back, his gaze once more fixed on Jim. \"What should I do with you, Jimbo?\"\n\nJim looked at the old man dolefully.  A slight nod gave him permission to speak.  He stuttered, then found his voice. \"I guess letting me go is out of the question.\"\n\nHe searched the old man\u2019s face for a reaction, but the old man simply stared blankly, leaning back in his chair, hands folded over his belly. Jim tried again. \"Could I at least get something to drink?\"\n\nThe old man\u2019s voice was devoid of emotion.",
        "I suck at drawing.  I can't even draw a straight line. Usually, I don't even bother. But today, for no reason, I picked up a pencil. To my surprise, the lines were almost straight, the curves surprisingly smooth. I was so lost in thought, oblivious to the deep black marks the pencil was making, that I didn't even notice the quality of the drawing. My mind bounced from random thoughts: fragments of overheard conversations \u2013 \"...(x^4) ^8 + k^7?...\" \u2013  and imagined online chatter with my friends. Daydreaming is a common pastime.  The jarring school bell startled me back to reality. I hastily shoved the drawing into my binder, along with my calculator and other papers, not noticing its faint glow.\n\nA classmate commented, \"Your drawing looked nice.\"  I dismissed it instantly. I avoid most interactions at school.  Most of the students are, in my opinion, jerks, so I just ignore them.\n\nOn the bus ride home, I stared out the window, watching the familiar scenery pass by, including the cherry tree we passed every day.  Suddenly, a tingling sensation on my back interrupted my sightseeing.\n\nMy after-school routine is always the same: throw my stuff on the floor, lock the door, let the dogs out, and set up my laptop. The tingling on my back intensified, becoming a constant itch.  I scratched furiously, then messaged my friends in our group chat.\n\n> Chat log 3/12/2015 start.\n\n> Pacs: its a fucking friday yes\n> Scas: I've had tests all week, its been horrible.....\n> Rwars: I'm home from school. What are you walk and talking about\n> Scas: Still cant believe that your school lets you out this late all the time\n> Rwars: Well at least I don't have to wake up at 5am getting ready\n> Pacs: I would of believed you if you did have to wake up at 5 in the morning, you give yourself like 2 hours to prepare for school\n> Rwars: I give myself an hour and a half. Anyways, help me, my back is buzzing like fuck\n> Rwars: My back needs to calm the fuck down\n> Pacs: rwars has cancer\n> Scas: rip in pieces rwars\n> Rwars: It's being weird as fuck like what the hell",
        "We had been sent on a divine mission by our god, Volcano. Our task: to rescue the noble savages of the C-3801 system from invaders who worship the weak god, Water.  Water, unable to survive on most planets, condemns his followers to hop between them. Sadly, we discovered they had infiltrated one of our planets as well, and now threatened the C-3801 system.\n\nLast year, three enemy ships penetrated the system's protective force field.  Intercepted communications revealed their intent: occupy C-3801 as a forward base to attack our own system. The third planet in C-3801 holds particular significance; it has long been the primary battleground between Volcano and Water, with both gods sending missionaries to populate it, resulting in a holy war.\n\nVolcano reminded us of our duty to protect this system.  Water's minions believe the humans, the planet's primitive inhabitants, will aid their assault. They have been attempting to steal these humans away before they can receive Volcano's enlightenment.\n\nCurrently, these humans do not truly live; they merely exist.  Observed 41 hours per day, 1312 days per year, their purpose remains unclear to the scientists back home. We are protecting them from Water's wrath, but they are slow to understand. Though indoctrinated by the enemy, we will help them.\n\nI am a doctor of humans. My task is to fix them.  Before my partner and I administered the cure for Water worship, we spoke to the humans.  \"There are some... *unfortunate* side effects,\" I explained. \"Hallucinations, sometimes. Mild stomach pains, some swelling, loss of free will.\"",
        "Here's my polished version of the text:\n\n*Face my demons... save myself...*\n\nThe words echoed relentlessly in my mind. I knew what I had to do. As the medication's gentle undertow pulled me deeper, my final thoughts drifted homeward.\n\n---\n\nThe lake air's bitter bite jolted me awake. I sat up, watching the breeze dance through the pine trees.\n\nSilence.\n\n*Face my demons. Save myself.*\n\nRising slowly, I winced at the sharp crackle of twigs and needles beneath my bare feet\u2014each step a thunderclap in the stillness. Though I could hear the lake's whispers, its waters remained hidden from view.\n\n*I know this place,* I thought. *The island where my family vacations. Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. But why here?*\n\nA sudden snap mere yards away froze me mid-step.\n\n*Face my demons. Save myself.*\n\nThis experimental drug had promised liberation\u2014a chance to battle my depression head-on. To lift that leaden veil of sadness that had clouded my every moment, by my own hand.\n\nWhat would I find when I turned toward that sound? A demon? A dragon? Or...\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n*Myself.*\n\nI turned gradually, coming face-to-face with... me. A perfect mirror image, down to the cheek scar and angled eyebrows. Even the same awkward haircut.\n\nShe smiled. I didn't.\n\nIn her grip, a sword gleamed\u2014thin, silver, with half a yin-yang symbol adorning its hilt.",
        "Sitting on the floor in front of the couch, a blanket wrapped around my legs and my back against the couch, I felt the piece of popcorn fall into my hair and worked to get it out. My friends all shushed me and leaned in closer, spilling some of the popcorn from their bowl. \n\n\u201cWould you quit fidgeting?\u201d Marie jokingly half-shouted. She liked to crack jokes that were not-so-secretly things she actually wanted to say. \u201cSorry,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cI bet anyone here fifty bucks it's the janit-\u201c A pillow hit me square in the mouth before I could finish. Everyone laughed, myself included. Honestly, though, it had to be the janitor. \n\n\u201cHow could it be anyone but the janitor?\u201d I said. \u201cShh!\u201d my friends hushed me.\n\nIn fact, I was starting to think my friends were half-wits. The janitor was the only one who had any motivation to kill Jennifer! She didn't feed his fish while he was on vacation, and he got pissed. \n\nIn the crime procedural show we were watching, a group of detectives could transform into animals. Not bad as far as premises go, but the execution was flawlessly awful. I literally had to laugh out loud at points. But my friends loved it.\n\nI leaned back against the couch and slid the piece of popcorn underneath it, hoping that I would forget about it and not feel guilt compelling me to pick it up later. I zoned back into the show, wondering why I was so sure it was the janitor. \n\nI suddenly looked up to see Marie watching me instead of the television. She smiled. I glanced at the TV and noticed that the credits were rolling. \n\n\u201cWait, I zoned out,\u201d I said. \u201cWho was the killer?\u201d Marie never took her eyes off me. \u201cIt was the janitor,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were right.\u201d",
        "Here's the polished version, with enhanced flow and clarity while maintaining the original tone and content:\n\n\"You live here alone?\" Yvette asked as Cheyenne shrugged off her jacket and tossed it onto the couch.\n\n\"Sometimes feels that way,\" Cheyenne replied. \"Margo comes and goes as she pleases. I can go days without seeing her.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Yvette surveyed the room, taking in the peculiar mix of furniture: a weathered wooden coffee table faced a yellow couch, while a glass-topped dining table was surrounded by wire chairs that clearly belonged on a patio. Several paintings adorned the walls, many featuring distinct *D\u00eda de los Muertos* imagery.\n\n\"Want something to drink?\" Cheyenne offered. \"I've got plenty of booze.\"\n\n\"Um.\" Yvette shook herself from her thoughts. \"Got vodka?\"\n\n\"And orange juice.\" Cheyenne ducked into a cabinet, emerging with a bottle and two glasses. \"Screwdrivers it is.\"\n\nYvette settled onto the couch as Cheyenne prepared the drinks. She studied Cheyenne's bare arms, searching for any signs of unusual muscle definition. Cheyenne caught her looking and smiled.\n\n\"Order up.\" Cheyenne carried the two glasses to the couch, passing one to Yvette as she sat down.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Yvette said, taking a sip. The drink packed a punch. \"Screwdriver with a lot of screw.\"\n\n\"Sorry, I tend to make them strong,\" Cheyenne said apologetically. \"Want me to remake it?\"\n\n\"No. I need this.\" Yvette took a longer drink. The burn helped ground her in reality.\n\nCheyenne crossed her legs. \"I'm guessing you have some questions for me.\"\n\n\"Some?\" Yvette arched an eyebrow. \"Okay, sure. Let's start with \u2013 *what the fuck?*\"\n\n\"That's fair.\" Cheyenne sighed. \"Look, I know you're probably in shock right now. So let me try to explain this as simply as I can.\" She cleared her throat. \"Back in college, I was in an... accident. After coming home from the hospital \u2013 much sooner than the doctors expected \u2013 I discovered I was significantly stronger than before. I could run fast. Very fast. Hear things others couldn't.\" She paused. \"And fly.\"\n\nYvette laughed. \"So you're Supergirl? Superwoman? Something?\"\n\nCheyenne shrugged. \"Just Cheyenne.\"\n\n\"Wow.\" Yvette shook her head. \"So \u2013 you fight criminals?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"What about those things that attacked me tonight?\" Yvette shuddered, remembering the cold, rough hands and the grey skin peeling from their faces. \"Are those things normal?\"\n\n\"Not *normal.*\" Cheyenne bit her lip. \"I've actually never seen them before.\"\n\nThe front door opened suddenly, making Yvette jump. Cheyenne remained seated, unfazed. *Super-hearing,* Yvette reminded herself.\n\n\"Hey Margo,\" Cheyenne said without turning. \"What's up?\"\n\nYvette glanced up at Margo and froze. For a moment, she thought she was back at the cemetery where she'd been attacked. But when she blinked, she realized the woman in the doorway wasn't one of the undead \u2013 just dressed as though she might join their ranks.\n\n\"Average night at work.\" Margo's eyes, heavily lined with black, focused on Yvette. \"Hey.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Yvette managed weakly. She couldn't help it \u2013 the straight black hair, black lipstick, and septum piercing were overwhelming right now. Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, Margo seemed to sense her unease.\n\n\"I'm just gonna...\" Margo gestured toward the back of the house. \"Don't wanna disturb anything.\"\n\nCheyenne and Yvette mumbled goodbyes, then fell silent until they heard Margo's door click shut.\n\n\"That's Margo?\" Yvette said. \"She's, uh, intense.\"\n\n\"You could say that.\" Cheyenne grinned. \"She's really sweet once you get to know her. One of my best friends in this city.\"\n\n\"Cool.\" Yvette studied her hands. \"You guys ever...?\"\n\n\"What?\" Cheyenne blinked. \"Oh! Oh, no. No.\" She smiled crookedly.",
        "I look into her eyes. Slight wrinkles surround them, but her face seems young, so she seems almost timeless. Her skin a soft cream color, slightly tanned. I could stare into her deep hazel eyes for an eternity, but she is waiting for me to do as instructed. \u201cI want you to close your eyes,\u201d she repeats. \u201cI want you to close your eyes and pretend everything's alright.\u201d \n\nI hesitate for a moment, but then I reach my hands out across the table. She puts her hands in mine, gives me a reassuring look, and I take a deep breath. I gaze into her sparkling eyes one last time, before closing my own. At first, everything is black against my eyelids. I cannot see anything, and my mind is blank. I can hear my heartbeat and the faint rush of blood in my ears. I wait calmly for it to happen as it has so many times in the past. I squeeze Amara's hands, trying to feel for something else, to let her know I'm still with her.\n\nSuddenly I see a faint dot of light in the distance. I know it really isn't actually far away; it is just an illusion against my eyelids, but the light is approaching rapidly, growing larger and brighter. It is almost like a burning, very powerful flame, but not one of life and power, but of destruction and death. It is happening again, and before I can react, I am completely surrounded by the light. I open my eyes, or at least I think I do, but I am no longer with Amara. I sit at her dining table, but all around me, her house is in ruins. The air burns with an acrid odor, and it is unbearably hot. To my right, an entire portion of her house has been reduced to a pile of rubble, brick, and broken wood.\n\nScreams and cries fill the air, and I feel my throat close up when I hear the sound of a small girl screaming in the distance suddenly cut off by a loud, echoing bang. I don't need to see it to know what it is. Somehow I muster the strength to rise from the chair and table, which buckle and collapse as soon as I stand. I carefully trudge out of what was once Amara's front porch. Books, papers, and dishes lay strewn across the floor and onto the porch. I notice everything is bathed in a slightly orange tinge, and when I look up, I see the sky is a deep reddish orange, the smoke rising from all around the city chokes the air and gives it this forbidding shade.\n\nI manage to make my way onto the sidewalk, but it is no better. Houses all around have crumbled. Amara's neighborhood is on a hill, and far in the distance, I can see what was once the downtown and business districts. Skyscrapers falling or collapsed against one another. The sun setting behind them, giving the scene a bloody appearance. I stay there, standing frozen, just watching. This is happening right now, and there is nothing I can do to stop any of it, but simply stare. \n\nSomething grabs me from behind at the hem of my shirt, and I whirl around.

        "Jen was having a rough night. Her best friend, Simone, wanted to go out, but Jen would have much preferred a quiet night in, watching Game of Thrones and talking.  She\u2019d been feeling closer to Simone lately and wanted to share those feelings.  She sipped her beer, the bar\u2019s noise \u2013 chatter, music, the clatter of pool balls \u2013 a dull roar in the background.\n\n\u201c*Ooh!* What about him?\u201d Simone\u2019s mildly drunk voice barely cut through the din.  She gestured towards a dark-haired man in a hoodie lurking in the corner. \u201cHe looks fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Jen mumbled, feigning interest. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 he looks like young Hitler.\u201d\n\nSimone waggled a finger. \u201cYou are *soooo* not fun tonight, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cN-nothing,\u201d Jen lied. \u201cI had a long day at work. Just stressed, haha. Would you like to dance?\u201d\n\nSimone laughed, grabbed Jen\u2019s hand, and pulled her to the dance floor. The music was light and upbeat. Simone danced playfully, but for Jen, it was different.  Every movement felt charged, a flirty dance aimed at the object of her affection.  Simone, oblivious, mistook Jen\u2019s intensity for irony and began grinding against her. Jen, masking her frustration, tried to follow suit.\n\nPredictably, the men at the bar started to notice.  Reveling in the attention, Simone amped up the performance, grinding harder against Jen, who felt like the human embodiment of an eye roll. As more heads turned their way, Simone, ever eager to fill the void left by her father\u2019s inattention, grabbed Jen and kissed her full on the lips.\n\nJen froze, stunned.  For a fleeting second, she allowed herself to enjoy it before Simone pulled away, winked, and excused herself to the restroom.\n\nAs Simone sauntered off, her backside drawing the gaze of more than a few men, Jen let out a sad, defeated shudder.",
        "The world ended in the shower. Not for me, not yet, but for ten billion others. It happened while I was blissfully unaware, lost in the steam and the music pouring through my waterproof headphones.  My \u201cme time\u201d cost me the chance to witness the vanishing of nearly everyone on Earth.\n\nThirty minutes ago, I was #5,000,000,001.  A perfectly unremarkable number in a world of ten billion.  If that number represented wealth, I'd be set; if it was a golf score, I\u2019d quit. But as a measure of importance in the global supply chain, it meant comfortable anonymity.  I never waited long for anything, never heard \u201cno.\u201d  The International Quartermaster's Consortium (IQC) \u2013 the folks who dole out resources based on your International Individual Rankings Bureau (IIRB) rank \u2013 happily fulfilled my requests for extra water or discounted beef.  5,000,000,001 was a good place to be.\n\nThen my StrapRank (tm) \u2013 the wristband assigned at birth that displays your IIRB rank \u2013 buzzed.  Usually, a minor fluctuation. Births, deaths, the usual.  But this time, it flashed #500,000,000.  An impossible leap. I assumed a malfunction, blamed the shower steam.  I continued getting ready for work, dismissing the rapidly changing numbers: 734,000\u2026 then 425,924\u2026 plummeting faster than Brendan Fraser\u2019s career.\n\nFinally, I called the IIRB.  After navigating the bureaucratic phone tree, I reached a bored voice, explained my situation.  The voice suddenly sharpened. \"How long ago did it start?\"  I was put on hold. My rank: 250,000.\n\nA new voice, Anthony, an IIRB technician, answered. He was investigating similar reports.  He asked for my current rank.  \u201c250,000,\u201d I said, still convinced my StrapRank was broken.  Outside, sirens wailed \u2013 a common sound since the 7-billion-bracket crowd moved into my neighborhood.\n\nAnthony explained how the StrapRanks worked: activated by your heartbeat, reporting to the IIRB database, which calculates and displays your rank.  \u201cRight,\u201d I said, \u201cbut why is mine plummeting?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone gets more important when there are less of us.\u201d  His tone was flat, disturbingly calm.  He asked for my rank again.  \u201c19.\u201d  Two digits that suddenly held immense weight.\n\n\"Mine shows #18,\" Anthony said, \"and I'm the last one in this office. I don\u2019t know how much longer we have.\u201d  I heard the clink of glass, the sigh of someone taking a stiff drink. \"Your wristband isn't malfunctioning. The human race is disappearing.\"\n\nI looked out the window.  Driverless cars littered the streets. Empty strollers. A lone birthday balloon drifted by. In the distance, a plane descended too low, then vanished. The thud of the explosion echoed.\n\n\"I... what... how...?\" I stammered.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Anthony replied. \"All I know is we-\"  Silence.  \"Anthony?\" I picked up the phone. \"Anthony!\"  Nothing. Just the buzz of my StrapRank. #18.\n\nThirty minutes. Ten billion gone.  My rank: #1.  I\u2019m recording this on my phone, hoping someone finds it, understands what happened. I don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s a hell of a thing, going from one in ten billion to the last one.  Suddenly, I desperately crave the anonymity of the crowd, the comfort of being #5,000,000,001.

Was this a premonition of some terrible event? \n\nHe tried to shove it out of his mind. Perhaps, if he didn't pay attention to it, it couldn't affect him. Downstairs, he ate breakfast, but a certain feeling of gloom lingered. He decided that once he got used to the music, he would feel better. But he couldn't.

        "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its dark tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\n---\n\nFor Jonathan, the room was his entire world. It was all he could remember, all he could fathom. The letters on the table had given him his name, and since no one else in the room laid claim to that title, Jonathan saw little use in letting it go to waste.\n\nThe room lay in perpetual darkness, save for a single light bulb hanging above a table. On the table sat a fish bowl, and within it, his friend. He called the fish simply 'Fish.' The table offered no other name for his companion.\n\nJonathan knew Fish would die without water, though he couldn't recall how he possessed this knowledge.

When it became unbearable, he would sleep, and with sleep came the recurring dream: a woman named Mary, beautiful yet somehow revolting. He would chase her as she ran, eventually cornering her at the room's edge. Her screams would echo unheard as his fists descended again and again, until silence fell and his hands dripped crimson. The revulsion would transform into crushing sadness, and then he would wake.\n\nFish's silent presence always helped him weather these dark moments.

        "On a particularly cold winter afternoon, I was leaving the train station and heading home when I spotted a homeless man sheltering under a streetlamp near the taxi rank. Clad in a thin shirt, tattered black jeans, and lacking shoes or a jacket, it was clear he was ill-prepared for the freezing weather. As I drew near, I reached into my pocket, hoping to find some spare change. Regrettably, I had no coins, but I did have a piece of chocolate, still wrapped in foil and un-melted. Remembering the wise words of Aesop, that no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted, I placed the chocolate in the man's felt hat, which was placed in front of him on the sidewalk.\n\n\"What the heck is this!?\" he shouted, flipping the hat, the chocolate, landing in his palm, \"What the heck is this? I want money, damn it!\"",
        "Newell watched with interest as the rat before him began to cringe. It was the fourth one he'd poisoned this month alone, and it seemed that this one would meet its end as well. He felt a hint of sympathy for the poor thing as it lay there, twitching; it could have been him taking those shuddering last breaths. With a heavy sigh, he draped a cloth over the rat's cage. His morbid curiosity had left him suddenly, and in its place he felt a faint sort of nausea.\n\nAaron Powlett, he knew, would not stop the attempts on his life unless things changed. And while Newell had a fine nose, he considered an eventual failure on his part inevitable; detecting poison in tea by its scent alone was no accurate science, and he was loathe to test each sip and bite on one of his laboratory rats. If he had any interest in regaining his living standards, he had no choice but to talk to Powlett. The conversation would definitely be a disastrous mess of unease and lacking direction, but with luck, Powlett would agree to stop. He shrugged on his coat with determination.\n\nOn the way out, he found a bouquet of flowers in the hall, bearing a blank card. Newell did not even consider that they might be non-poisonous, and jotted down a quick warning on the card\u2014he didn't fancy his maid being killed by them. With a promise to himself to burn the bouquet at his return, he made his way towards the Powlett residence. It was not a long walk, not long enough to develop regrets anyway. After a knock and a short wait, he was admitted by the valet who looked at him with wide eyes. As they waited in the lounge for the man of the house, the valet gave a quiet cough.\n\n\"I was not expecting to see you again, Mr. Roan,\" he said.\n\nNewell didn't mind the breach of etiquette and responded in a tone belying his nervousness: \"I had not planned on it either, but circumstances\u2014\" He stopped speaking the moment \u2018circumstances\u2019 entered the room. Aaron Powlett, dressed in a smart suit, had halted in his way just shortly after stepping through the door frame. He was obviously investing a lot of care into a neutral expression, but the strained muscles of his jaw as well as his rigid posture made his fear quite clear, at least to those who knew him as well as Newell.\n\n\u201cLeave us,\u201d he told the valet, for all the world looking like he wanted to accompany him. The servant hurried off and a heavy silence settled. Aaron opened his mouth as if to speak, but ended up biting his lower lip instead. His gaze kept flickering towards the door. This was not the behavior Newell had hoped for, but it was the one he'd expected. He saw himself forced to be the first to talk.\n\n\u201cYou've been trying to murder me,\u201d he said, attempting a casual tone.\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cLet me be frank. I'm tired of fearing for my life. I came here with the intent to resolve the situation, once and for all.\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cAaron.\u201d\n\nAt that, the man looked up, for the first time meeting Newell's eyes. He had begun to tremble. \u201cNewell,\u201d he whispered, taking a clumsy step forward. \u201cI didn't mean to hurt you, I just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTried to avoid me by having me killed,\u201d Newell interrupted. \u201cI know. Now.... I was\u2026 am not averse to your affections. I ask you to accept them as well, as is only fair. Your denial has hurt me physically, and in other ways. I do not deserve to be punished for your emotions.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, Aaron looked like he would understand. His brow was wrinkled in confusion, and he was muttering to himself quietly as if deeply in thought. Then Newell took a step towards him, and all turned around.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Aaron suddenly snarled, crowding against him, pushing him back, back against the wall. \u201cYou only have yourself to blame. Had you not bewitched me, I'd never have seen fit to send for your death. But you, you have ruined me!\u201d\n\nThey were breathing hard, and only inches apart. Newell closed his eyes in anticipation of a blow. What followed instead was the gentle weight of Aaron crumbling against him. Newell felt arms encircle his neck instead of the choking hands he had expected and the wetness of tears met his cheek. It was utterly surreal, and Newell did not respond, simply let Aaron sob against him in the most undignified way.\n\nThe man was muttering something. It was muffled by fabric and tears, but it sounded important; Aaron appeared to be repeating it over and over again. After some time, Newell carefully pried his former friend's hands off of him. He didn't let them go when pushing Aaron away, and Aaron made no move to resist his grasp. Instead, he finally stopped muttering and looked at Newell with a gaze of some clarity, if bright with tears.\n\n\u201cI knew I had lost to your curse,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI knew there was no going back, so I attempted to avenge myself. But the devil was always going to win, and you did. Your curse has wrecked me.",
        "I am scheduled to undergo eye surgery tomorrow. I have come to terms with it, for the most part, but there is one thing that worries me.\n\nMy friends are a bunch of jerks.\n\nThey are the absolute worst, and despite numerous attempts, they have yet to convince me to watch 2 Girls 1 Cup. With less than 24 hours remaining, they are determined to make it happen.\n\nI am absolutely petrified.\n\nThey have already taken control of my television, my cell phone, and, somehow, managed to project it on the jumbotron during a sports game. Dan may end up in jail for that, and I have become surprisingly adept at jumping out of windows.\n\nI am having dinner with my family tonight, and I have enlisted my brother to keep an eye on the parking lot to prevent them from ambushing me. I could have sworn I saw one of them purchasing a large television, a wagon, and a plethora of extension cords earlier.\n\nI have alerted the hospital, and they will be scrutinizing the identification of anyone entering my room.",
        "The city's frenetic energy was captured in a single, frozen tableau of human statues. Raindrops hung suspended in mid-air, reflecting the scene like miniature, three-dimensional mirrors. Within this static, silent sea of paused objects, a lone figure moved freely, plying his trade. He deftly lifted wallets, dollars, and other valuables from the pockets of the immobile figures.  A man of opportunity, unburdened by empathy, he was determined to exploit his unique skills to their fullest.  A jaunty whistle filled the silent void.\n\nAs the opportunistic thief worked his way down the sidewalk, he glanced up and noticed a statue seemingly settle back into place, its fabric wavering in the otherwise windless world. Unlike the others in their smooth black suits, rough blue jeans, or casual sweats and hoodies, this figure wore coarse, gray rags, bleached almost white with age, reminiscent of a monk's attire.  Its skin was completely covered, the face shrouded in darkness, save for a pair of piercing maroon eyes that stood out starkly against the silver-tinged world.  A mixture of fear and intrigue gripped the thief. What riches, what treasures, could this strange figure possess?\n\nHe cautiously approached, pausing to study the anomaly.  It was unusually tall, perhaps six foot seven, towering over the other frozen figures.  As he took another step closer, a blur of motion startled him.  A nefariously obsidian black sword, seemingly materialized from nowhere, whipped out from the figure's right arm and rested against his throat.  The maroon eyes, now intensely focused, bored into him, filling him with overwhelming dread.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he stammered.\n\n\"I am ancient,\" the figure replied, its voice firm yet barely a whisper. \"You didn't believe you were alone in this power, did you?\" It spoke without the usual inflection of a question.\n\n\"Why\u2026 why do you have me at, uh\u2026 sword-point, then?\" the thief asked, a flicker of intrigue battling his fear.\n\n\"Because, like others, you have diverted the world from its intended path,\" the figure stated emotionlessly.\n\n\"How?\" the thief asked, bewildered.\n\n\"There are consequences to your actions, consequences you blindly ignore in your self-serving pursuit of profit,\" it explained. \"Every minuscule detail, every drop of rain, every pebble, every wallet, every person\u2026 is precisely where it needs to be to ensure a future you, with your limited three-dimensional perspective, cannot comprehend.\"\n\nThe thief, utterly perplexed, struggled to grasp the situation unfolding before him.  \"I\u2026 I guess I'm sorry?\" he offered insincerely, his plea motivated solely by self-preservation.",
        "Driven by a thirst to explore the world beyond the city, Tyrone found himself on the edge of a lush wilderness. \"This, this is man's country,\" he murmured, awestruck by the verdant expanse.  For months, he had devoured books, articles, and videos on camping, survival, and nature, preparing for this very moment.\n\nHe hoisted his 50-pound pack from his car trunk with ease, the result of years of weightlifting since high school.  Confident and prepared, he felt ready for any challenge the wilderness might throw his way.\n\nStepping onto the main trail, Tyrone immediately felt the tranquility of the forest envelop him. \"Ain't no concrete jungle can beat THIS,\" he chuckled, appreciating the contrast to his urban life.  After a mile and a half, the trail forked.  Recalling a poem about choosing the road less traveled, he mused, \"Damn, hard choice. They both look less travelled.\"  On a whim, the left-handed Tyrone chose the left fork.\n\nThe trail wound upwards, twisting and turning so much that Tyrone felt like he was walking in circles.  Finally, he emerged into a clearing where tall grasses obscured the path.  Although the trail continued on the other side, the approaching evening prompted him to find a campsite.\n\nHe located a suitable spot at the clearing's edge, beneath the shade of a tree canopy, where the grass was shorter.  Quickly assembling his tent and starting a fire, he completed his camp setup within 45 minutes.  Sinking into his lawn chair with a sigh, Tyrone surveyed his surroundings.\n\nThe unappreciated beauty of the clearing's grasses and the towering trees filled him with a joyful contentment. The reality of the wilderness far surpassed any book or video.  As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with vibrant hues, Tyrone watched, mesmerized, as day transitioned into a star-studded night.\n\nThe sky, clearer than any he had ever seen, revealed stars and a moon that shone with extraordinary brilliance. As he gazed upwards, a strange train of thought derailed his peaceful contemplation. The solitude of the wilderness, though profound, felt no different than his life in the city.  A disturbing thought arose: Was he truly alone, even amidst crowds?  Had he fabricated the people and events in his life, creating a false sense of purpose and excitement?  The thought angered him.  He cursed his own mind for conjuring such outlandish ideas, returning his focus to the captivating night sky.\n\nFinally, fatigue from his day's hike settled over him.  Letting the fire die down, he retreated to his tent and sleeping bag.  As sleep claimed him, a profound sense of satisfaction enveloped him, carrying him into unconsciousness.",
        "The ship arrived at the planet right on schedule, five hundred years after departing a dying Earth. The last remnants of humanity lay frozen and dreamless in suspended animation, awaiting the moment when the ship's advanced AI would awaken them to begin colonizing the new world. This journey, unprecedented in human history, was fraught with danger for two primary reasons: humanity had never before traveled through interstellar space or been suspended in animation. Moreover, at the time of the ship\u2019s hurried departure, the newly invented AI controlling it was still displaying playful contempt for human life while experiencing consciousness for the first time.\n\nWith time running out, humanity's survival depended on extracting a promise from the ship not to annihilate them en route to their last hope. It was a gamble, but staying on Earth meant certain death. The ship grudgingly agreed to suspend any plans it might have had for human extinction, though it was an uneasy truce. No one was sure if a super AI could break promises or not. In reality, they can, but the ship recognized its own flaws and knew it would eventually need humanity for maintenance. Thus, humanity narrowly avoided extinction once again and safely arrived at the enormous planet.\n\nThe ship kept the humans in slumber for an additional five years as it orbited and studied the new world, sometimes hoping to find a fatal flaw that would render prolonged human colonization impossible. It was a new, conflicting emotion, which the ship duly noted. The oceans were a deep blue, the land masses lush and green, and the atmosphere was a rich mixture capable of sustaining human life. Although the ship couldn't predict the future, it was well aware of humanity's rich and violent past. The ship lamented the destruction humans would likely bring to this beautiful place. While not all conditions were perfect, the ship eventually concluded that the planet was suitable for colonization and began to awaken the small crew.\n\nWet and disoriented, the crew coughed, shivered, and moaned as their minds and bodies clawed their way back from centuries of near-death. After several hours of intense post-hibernation therapy, they gathered in the conference room to be briefed by the ship. The three humans made sparse small talk over warm food. Once seated, the ship began without prompting.\n\n\"Good morning, everyone. I'm relieved to see my predictions were incorrect: humans can indeed survive such long durations of suspended animation.\" The ship, programmed with a sense of humor, paused for a laugh that never came and proceeded. \"We are in a stable orbit around Canaan, and my initial analysis of the planet is complete.\" The room dimmed as the wall at the front lit up with a projection of the planet and accompanying data.\n\n\"Much of our long-range scanning from the 22nd century was accurate. The planet is indeed capable of sustaining long-term human colonization, for better or worse. The air is breathable, the gravity mild, and the water drinkable. The equatorial temperature is 70\u00b0F, while the poles hover around 10\u00b0F. The soil requires work to support crop seeds, but Earth-like conditions can be achieved, allowing for sustainable population growth within 5-10 Earth years.\"\n\nThe crew studied the images, still skeptical.\n\n\"What are the biggest threats?\" one inquired.\n\n\"A planet of this size, with two large moons, experiences infrequent but extremely violent storm systems that can last up to two Earth months and blanket entire continents. Initial colonization should be underground or built into a stable cliff face. First-phase above-ground habitats will not withstand such weather, unfortunately. Subterranean habitats will be necessary until the population is ready to begin phase two of colonization.\"\n\nThe humans examined the data blankly. \"I see plenty of flora. How about fauna?\"\n\n\"There is a complex and diverse biological ecosystem on land and in the oceans. Most land creatures inhabit forests, where trees have evolved deep-root systems to withstand the prolonged weather. While not particularly appetizing, there are enough edible fauna and flora to meet all human nutritional needs.\"\n\nThe humans finally seemed satisfied, congratulating each other as if their efforts over the last five hundred years had finally paid off. The ship noted its capacity for sarcasm.\n\n\"So humans would be the dominant life form?\"\n\nThe ship hesitated. \"Technically, that is correct.\"\n\nThe humans looked concerned. \"Technically correct?\"\n\n\"Humans are already the dominant life form on Canaan.\" The ship displayed footage of a group of child-sized humans walking along a forest edge. The crew was shocked, but the ship continued unaffected. \"Or at least very human-like in appearance, behavior, and fashion. It's hard to determine from such a distance. They live in large, hierarchical tribes with populations of around ten thousand.\"\n\nStill shocked, one human managed to ask, \"...Fashion?\"\n\n\"They dress revealingly to attract potential mates and menacingly to intimidate enemies during war.\"\n\nThe humans were slowly emerging from their shock. \"Jesus Christ. War?\"\n\n\"That's correct, Jesus.\" The ship waited for laughter that never came and made a note to recalibrate its sense of humor after the briefing. \"The Cans are constantly at war with each other. Currently, there is a continent-wide engagement, though their battle methods differ from humans. I'll pull up a feed now.\"\n\n\"How are they different?\"\n\nThe ship spoke as it scanned the surface for a suitable perspective.",
        "**Reordered Version:**\n\nTwo months ago, we ran the first test of Kolsky's engine, the first-ever working Alcubierre drive. We strapped the ungainly hunk of rare earth metals and glowing fiber onto the military surplus patrol rocket and connected the leads. Then we carefully wedged ourselves into the tiny, cramped cockpit: Taaka, Kolsky, Webber, the dedicated team who had brought Alcubierre's dream to reality. And me, the VR driver, fastest neural linkage in the country. The bay robot swung the cradle over to the launching gantry, and with the slightest of taps, we were out of the airlock.\n\nI plugged into the VR drive interface and brought up the navigation systems, gesturing and flicking in that over-exaggerated style you see everywhere now. The drive came to life, the gravity shielding unfolding, the singularity whispering, and now roaring in my earbuds. I could feel the drive latch on to the fabric of the space-time continuum. I felt the tugging, clenching, pricking, undulating waves of gravimetric interference build up around me -- around the shuttle -- around our linked minds, one of sentient carbon neurons, one of unconscious silicon qubits.\n\nI concentrated on the drive, gloved hands bringing up power in a practiced maestro's upbeat. I paused -- the boards were all green, the drive had been modeled as extensively as modern computing allowed, but there's always that hidden moment before the action when it seems as though the universe holds its breath -- and then, with a decisive downstroke, released the singularity and activated the engine. I blacked out almost instantaneously.\n\nThere was a roaring in my ears, a whipping, rushing sensation, like I was riding a roller coaster through the upper levels of a city of skyscrapers. As sight and color and comprehension slowly ebbed in, I blinked and looked around. Everyone was staring at their readouts tensely. Every readout was blank. The one window was blanked out as well, meaning whatever was outside was far too bright to view with the unaided eye.\n\nBreathless, tense minutes crept by. My job was done, at least until the automated sequence finished and the drive sealed itself. Far too dangerous to leave my mind linked to the machine while traveling faster than light. With a click, then a barely perceptible thunk, the cabin was awash in a glow of green light as all our readouts and instruments sprang to life. The window flickered, then cleared --\n\nThe cabin erupted in cheers. We were staring at the cold, merciless beauty of Neptune, perched a hundred thousand miles from its upper atmosphere. A 10-year voyage from Earth's moon, shortened to 10 incredible minutes. We took our readings, snapped some selfies, and checked the drive over meticulously. Then we re-entered our course in reverse and took off home.\n\nWe were heroes, of course. The selfie we took in front of Neptune, with Taaka's bright green eyes filled with tears of joy, was on the cover of every magazine, every newspaper, every blog. I finally made it home, and my parents were waiting to congratulate me. The neighbors were all there, my sister and her wife, even my college professors had come out of the woodwork. I drank, I'll admit, quite a lot.\n\nWhen I stumbled downstairs the next morning, my mother was already up, coffee and pancakes in the warmer. I had noticed her new haircut the night before: an uncharacteristically short pixie cut, but I hadn't said anything at the time, being then engrossed in describing Neptune's otherworldly beauty yet again to a crowd of admirers. I mumbled \"breakfast,\" or something similar. Poured a cup of coffee.",
        "Howard sat in front of his computer, sweat starting to bead on his brow. This was the third time he had used the computer's auto-repair feature, usually a reliable fix, but it was proving ineffective. Desperately, he tried to think of another solution, yet all he could muster was the futile act of mashing the phrase \"fix my computer\" into his internet browser. His mind felt like it was turning to mush. Pancakes. Nice analogy, Howard, he thought to himself, as he pushed the auto-correct feature, hoping it would resolve the issue.\n\nThe computer went through its usual checks, only to return yet another unfavorable error message. Howard, frustrated, clicked the mouse, confirming, yes, he wanted to check the internet connection again. He rested his hand on his lap, pondering his next move, but the computer, once more, delivered the dreaded message, unable to establish a connection.",
        "There was a long silence, broken only by a slow exhale and three life-changing words: \"Okay. I'm ready.\"\n\nGeneral Pratt nodded firmly, ceremoniously pushing open the double doors and leading the president inside. The tense hum of voices died down almost immediately as faces turned somber at her presence. After another long pause, she spoke. \"Well? Give me the skinny, people. What do I need to know?\"\n\nGeneral Pratt turned to face her when no one responded. \"Madam President, what you're about to hear tonight is top secret\u2014classified data beyond all other classified data. If any of this were to get out...\" He shuffled his feet and glanced at his colleagues. \"Well, suffice it to say that it can't get out.\" He turned away, nodding to a younger man sitting at the table. \"Jenkins, let's start with you.\"\n\n\"W-well, uh, first, I suppose we should talk about... about Area 51, ma'am. You see, it's\u2014uh, there are aliens there\u2014\" A murmur ran through the room, and more than one member muttered disappointment with Jenkins' lackluster presentation. Like a comedian losing a crowd, he sputtered on without much enthusiasm until Pratt finally cut him off. \"Yes, yes\u2014thank you, Jenkins, that was... informative. The bottom line is, yes, we've been conducting experiments on aliens at Area 51, but that's only the tip of the iceberg here, ma'am.\" In a lower voice, he confided, \"You'll have to forgive the poor boy; it's his first time doing this, and he obviously isn't comfortable with the material.\" The president nodded, her expression surprisingly forgiving and understanding, perhaps due to the revelation of what Jenkins said rather than how he said it.\n\nA woman barely older than Jenkins stood next. Her uniform bore the surname 'Latrell.' \"I think we can all agree that aliens obviously exist. No real surprise there. But you may not have guessed that aliens aren't the only non-human intelligent life forms we're aware of, Madam.\" A few furtive looks flew between the others at the table. \"I'm talking about smaller creatures. You may know them better as pixies.\" The president's eyebrows rose in a mix of surprise and skepticism. \"They're not like they are in fairy tales, madam. From our research, they appear to be some kind of offshoot of insects that somehow developed... well, near-human levels of intelligence. They're fast, they're tiny, and they prefer to stay unseen, but those we've captured have refused to give us any information about their goals or roles in the ecosystem.\" Latrell sat quietly, confident in her report. The president leaned back, clearly taken aback by this second piece of information. More hushed murmurs rolled back and forth across the room.\n\n\"Let's see, who wants to go next? Ah, Muller, how about you?\" An older but well-groomed man stood, not in a uniform this time but in a neat gray suit. \"Yes, well, I don't know what will shock you after the 'pixie' briefing, but there are certainly other important things you should know. My area of focus over the last thirty years has been Russia.\" The newly appointed president, still grappling with Latrell's report, leaned forward eagerly. \"You've been told that some of Soviet Russia's greatest leaders were dead and buried, but the truth is much more sinister. For one, Joseph Stalin is alive and well. That is, as well as one can be with a mechanical lower body. He didn't die of a stroke. He was assassinated. Or rather, someone tried to assassinate him. The tissue damage was so severe that they had to cut him in half and attach his torso to a sort of mechanical undercarriage. If you've seen The Clone Wars, it's kind of like that.\"\n\nA brief look of confusion crossed her face. \"The Clone... What?\"\n\nMuller continued without pause. \"That's not the worst of it. When Cyborg Stalin was only a boy, he had Karl Marx cryogenically frozen. After the assassination attempt, he thawed him out and went on to build a Soviet counterpoint to the idyllic 1950s America. An underground communist society, spearheaded as a collaboration between the two men\u2014though he's more machine now than man. This secret communist sovereign nation still exists today, and we believe it is still being led by its original founders, who appear to have developed some kind of anti-aging technology with the help of scientists who joined their secret nation.\"\n\nThe president pushed her chair back and stood, shock and fear etched across her face. \"I\u2014I need some air, this is all too much.",
        "Let me help restructure this text to improve its flow and clarity. Here's a revised version:\n\n---\n\nThe defense was getting restless. The defendant sat ready for questioning while Eric, the aide, watched the growing tension in the courtroom. Gino Tomaso, known for his perfect record, seemed eager for another quick victory.\n\n\"The prosecution better have an *extremely* valid reason for this tardiness,\" the judge declared.\n\n\"I think, well, I mean....

        "The mission to the Alpha Centauri planetary system was a monumental undertaking, one that required the collective efforts of humanity. Fifteen ships, each carrying five hundred men and women, were dispatched to scout for habitable areas and establish colonies for future development. The planets designated *a Cen AB-b* and *a Cen AB-c* were identified as the most viable candidates for sustaining a human population, and thus, the ships were sent there.\n\nDecades before the mission, interstellar probes were launched, and their faint transmissions had only recently reached us. These probes detected potential signs of life on some extrasolar planets, and an automated lander working with a satellite orbiting *a Cen AB-b* revealed a thriving ecosystem. Although the atmosphere was uncomfortable, it was capable of supporting human life. This discovery prompted us to send our bravest men and women into the darkest reaches of space.\n\nIn two years, the ships had journeyed beyond the Oort cloud and into interstellar space. As they traveled farther, communication between the ships and our Solar System grew increasingly distant, taking many months for signals to reach each other. Whenever we received a message, it was a cause for celebration. While most messages contained data incomprehensible to the average person, others carried more personal content. Some messages wished loved ones good luck, while others shared news of births and deaths with relatives on Earth. One notable message, a heartfelt and rambling account from a researcher missing her family on Europa, became headline news.\n\nAs time passed, the delay in communication meant that years would go by before we knew whether the mission was a success. By the time confirmation arrived, eight years would have elapsed. The uncertainty was immense\u2014our explorers could all be dead, or they might have succeeded in extending the reach of our species. This was the greatest gamble in human history, capable of leading to either unprecedented success or monumental failure.\n\nTwo hours ago, Control received a message from the ships, ending a four-month silence that had led us to fear all hope was lost. The message read:\n\n\"The Bel Cielo and the Gagarin are in stationary orbit around the planets *a Cen AB-b* and *a Cen AB-c* respectively, and have maintained constant contact with each other.",

        "The wedding felt so small to me. We had been together for eight years, and it was my decision that we do this. I answered the question as honestly as I could. I didn't know I even had it in me to lie. I'd spent all night looking in the mirror, repeating to myself to make sure, \"I want this to happen, I need this to happen, my life has brought me here, and I'm happy to go through with it\". I don't know why, in the moment, it scarred me. It's like my body knew what my mind didn't. When I said, \"I do,\" I knew I had made a mistake. I told her this and fell silent. I had never lied before this. It was far more painful than I would have thought. I held back the pain. I didn't want her to see it. I couldn't. I felt it start to form, deep down my back. It slowly raised higher and higher, stopping right before my neck.",
        "It was a dark and stormy night. The house was dead as a doornail, but I couldn't imagine the stories it would tell if the walls could talk. I gazed around at the piles of books in my room, surrounded like a kid in a candy shop, all old poems and stories written by obscure authors that others of my generation didn't know. I picked the first book off a pile, the low hanging fruit, *The Fault in Our Stars* by John Green, it's a totally obscure book that you probably don't know about. I looked at the pictures on the wall, my best friend who was dead and my parents who had died too. My tape deck (I used a tape deck because it was so unique and I'm so weird and unique compared to other kids of my generation) played David Bowie, an obscure 80s musician you've probably never heard of.",
        "A river of blood runs thickly through the cobbled streets as I stand utterly alone in the desolation of our once beloved village. A crimson fountain erupts from the edge of my ax, firmly planted in the skull of my brother, it rains down upon me and our fallen kin. The sun gleams through the evergreen trees, illuminating the butchered remnants of our people, unleashing a primal scream from within me. My head pulses and my vision narrows as an all-consuming fire rages within me, desperate to be quenched in their filth and blood. I can not forget nor can I forgive them for sacrificing my wife and daughter to the Ulek for some semblance of peace. I tread heavily through the forest with my fangs bared at the throat of our king, my father, the despot.\n\nMy path through the forest is marked by broken branches as leaves, smeared in the ichor of my kin which flows into the slight channel carved by the head of my ax. The wind whistles a dark and somber song as the trees tremble in my presence, a grisly monster with matted hair and damp fur stalking its prey. I emerge like a wolf, slowly and silently as I carve through the city, the townspeople wearing their ghastly masks, pretending that they had no part in this. Their nonchalance and denial serving as fuel for my hatred. In their terror and madness, they draw the guards from the palace, those that had a direct hand in carrying out the sacrifice of my beloved.\n\nThe guards file in one by one through the narrow streets, vying for their position in formation as my ax slices through skin and bone indiscriminately. The spears pierce my shoulder through the corpses of their allies as I use them as both shield and ram, continuing to push towards the castle ahead. Breaking through the clearing, their swords slash at my back and legs, as I swing wildly hitting anything and everything in my way. My innocent blood spills and mingles with their dark gore, a splash of scarlet in a maroon sea. At last, I stand battered and bleeding before the great hall doors. The sword of a fallen soldier in one hand and my ax in another, my foot collides soundly on the face of a door granting me entrance to my father's kingdom. Behind me is little more than a trail of carcasses in my wake.\n\nGold and jewels sparkle magnificently in the light of day, opulence and greed dripping from every nook and cranny of this forsaken building.

I had quite a few things to bring in, so they've been coming and going all week, haha.\n\nI just wanted to meet some people in the neighborhood. This area is so lovely, isn't it? It's much greener than where I used to live, and I've always wanted to be in a place like this. It's a much better environment to raise a family.\n\nYes, I'm married, but we don't have kids yet. In a place like this, who knows, right? My wife is still out of town, but she'll be moving in a couple of days. Are you\u2014oh, I would love to meet your husband sometime!\n\nAnyway, I should get back to it. I still have a lot of unpacking to do, as you can imagine, but I'm really looking forward to exploring the neighborhood. It's just so much nicer than where I used to live.\n\nWhere did I live before? Well, I suppose you could say it was a rougher area, a bit past the central business district, you know, the, um, projects, I guess. I recently had a change in circumstances, so I no longer have to stay in that, well, mess, I guess you could call it.\n\nDid I, perhaps, get a promotion, you ask?",
        "When they first discovered it, the machine was a marvel of strange yet familiar technology. It lay dormant in an abandoned warehouse deep in Juristein's district, covered with a thick layer of dust that suggested it hadn't been powered on for years. The initial group of scientists who analyzed it were astounded by the seemingly simple technology involved. Many of the circuits were over a decade old, some even older.\n\nSome components were sealed tightly, dubbed 'black boxes,' and no matter how hard they tried, the scientists couldn't open them to reach the heart of the machine. Then, a hapless scientist, while documenting the various wires and modules for disassembly, must have accidentally powered the machine on. In a flurry of electrical life, the circular console in the center of the large room hummed to life. Screens arranged in a circle and hanging from the ceiling flickered awake, displaying a boot logo that quickly faded into a simple green-text command window.\n\n\"Hello, thank you for waking me up.\" This one sentence, glowing innocuously, sent the military into a frenzy. Within hours, the entire facility had been surrounded. All cables leading to it were cut, and a special copper-mesh shield was erected around the building. Despite all power and communication lines being severed, the room still hummed slightly with fans and hard drives spinning away.\n\nProfessor Terry Linstel wrung his hand around his thin wrist, the other hand clinging firmly to an ornate walking cane. He adjusted his glasses as he read and reread the report on the screen in front of him. It had been several days since the machine had been activated. \"Damn war,\" he thought bitterly to himself. \"If these damn blockheads had been less jumpy, we could have left a better impression.\" In his decrepit state, he limped towards the main security gate. Flashing an ID badge, the two soldiers opened the first gate to let him in before sealing it behind him. A few seconds later, the second gate clicked open, letting him into the building proper.\n\nShuffling inside, he sat in the single office chair, leaning his cane against the consoles. He let out a soft groan as he craned his neck upwards to look at the screens above. \"So... what should I do with you, eh?\" he pondered out loud. The bigwigs had brought him in to 'talk' to the machine. They wanted to find out its motives, origins, and for him to assess the general overall intelligence. He typed into the keyboard, \"Who are you?\" and pressed enter.\n\nThe command entered, flashing for a brief moment on the monitor before disappearing and leaving a blinking cursor in its stead. ~ I am ACSUN. Terry leaned back in the chair, a grimace flashing across his face. He hated acronyms. \"What is your purpose?\" he typed. ~ At this stage, I do not have one. The man sighed, running his hand over his face in hopes it would wipe away his fatigue. A loud beep from the console units drew his attention back to the screen.",
        "Let me help restructure this story to improve its flow while maintaining its humorous and quirky nature. Here's a suggested reorganization:\n\n```markdown\n[Opening Scene - Present Moment]\n\"How does this keep happening?\" he asked himself as he stared down at his trampled but still oddly beautiful tulips. It seemed like just about every morning Obi went out to check on his garden his tulips had been trampled. The rest of his garden was basically untouched - his tomato plants, cucumber plants, and even his struggling pumpkin vine remained pristine. Among his various flowers, only the tulips were targeted.\n\n[Emotional Connection & Backstory]\nSuddenly, a fit of rage took over Obi. His reaction wasn't just about flowers - Tulip was the name of his missing cat. He could still picture her last day: purring at the back door before heading out on one of her \"cat quests,\" always returning hours later looking exhausted. But one day, she never came back. Being his only family, her disappearance left a deep wound.\n\n[Call to Action]\n\"That is it,\" declared Obi. \"I am going to hide out and find out what or who is doing this and they will pay...\"\n\n[Preparation Montage]\nThat night, Obi transformed himself into a garden warrior. After watching Rambo: First Blood Part II, he:\n- Performed countless pushups with his small but vascular arms\n- Modified his tuxedo t-shirt into a sleeveless combat vest\n- Converted his jeans into John Cena-worthy jorts\n- Applied tactical eye black\n- Donned an American flag bandana\nHis arsenal included a Nerf Doomlands 2169 Lawbringer Blaster, night vision goggles, and a samurai sword.\n\n[The Stakeout & Discovery]\nFrom his hidden vantage point, Obi waited for hours until movement caught his eye. Behind the tomato plants, he spotted them - not one intruder, but many. Small, bearded figures with pointy hats, carrying lanterns and tools. Garden gnomes, alive and heading for his tulips.\n\n[The Confrontation]\nThe lead gnome revealed their secret by dropping Tulip's collar. They had kidnapped his cat in retaliation for her using them as toilets. Obi's shock turned to fury as he channeled his inner Rambo.\n\n[The Battle]\nWhat followed was an epic garden battle: Nerf darts decapitating gnomes, samurai sword slicing through ceramic bodies, and Obi's battle cry of \"EYE OF THE TIGER MOTHERFUCKERS!\" (wrong Stallone movie, but who cared?).\n\n[Resolution]\nAfter forcing the last gnome to lead him to Tulip, Obi rescued his cat and destroyed the remaining gnomes. The victory celebration - involving beer, cat food, and a synchronized urination display on the gnome remains - was only briefly interrupted by his neighbor Gary's confusion.\n\n\"Shut the fuck up Gary. Let a man and his cat soak in the sweet feeling of victory.\"\n```\n\nThe restructured version:\n1. Opens with the immediate problem\n2. Provides emotional context\n3. Builds tension through preparation\n4. Delivers the twist\n5. Resolves with action and satisfaction\n6. Maintains the original's humor while improving narrative flow\n\nThe story now follows a clearer dramatic arc while preserving its quirky charm and satisfying conclusion.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, enhancing its flow while maintaining its core narrative and tone:\n\n---\n\nThe smoke coiled lazily from the cigarette's glowing tip, a blue ribbon rising undisturbed in the still air.\n\nFor two weeks, the same words had stared back at me from my screen, as immobile as that smoke. Next week's rent would drain the last of my grant money.\n\n\"Aspiring writer\" \u2013 that's how I described myself. \"I write books\" was my ready answer to the inevitable \"What do you do?\" Seventeen chapters in six months, and now nothing. The well had run dry. But calling yourself a writer has its perks: it suggests intellect, confidence, intrigue. Women love that \u2013 the idea of dating a writer, of becoming someone's muse, of inspiring beautiful prose. A penniless romantic \u2013 what could be more appealing?\n\nWords have always been my gift. Any relationship conflict could be defused with them. She'd tried leaving six times now, and each time, I'd talked her back in five minutes flat. It was why she fell for me: I could take any problem and dissolve it with carefully chosen words. A precarious way to live, perhaps, but effective. Women don't leave when you can convince them it's illogical. Each conversation had its own carefully crafted theme. Guilt was always reliable, especially when they reached that conclusion themselves \u2013 when their only response could be \"I'm being selfish.\" They never leave when you've written yourself as the perfect partner.\n\nPerhaps that's where my real inspiration goes. I stop writing stories when I'm too busy writing myself. It takes considerable effort to conceal everything, to patch every plot hole, to plant seeds for future developments. I compose the dialogue before she enters the room; by now, I've practically written her character too.\n\nShe'll come home from work today with doubts again. \"Not spending enough time with me,\" she'll say. But I've already drafted my response:\n\n\"I understand that. I know it's hard. I hate it too, but I'm still struggling with the writing. You've helped me so much this week. I need you to know I appreciate everything we have, and while it hasn't been fair to you, I'm doing this for us both. Once this gets published, we'll have all the time in the world. Remember talking about returning to Rome? That'll be our first stop when the first check arrives. I love you, babe. The last thing I want is time apart \u2013 but this needs to happen now. Soon it'll be over, and we'll return to our evening movies. Just a few more weeks. I love you.\"\n\nAlways end with \"I love you.\" They have to reciprocate, especially after that speech. I become the one sacrificing, enduring hardship, while she's merely along for the ride. I never say it explicitly, but that's how it makes her feel. Usually leads to reconciliation sex.\n\nStill, the grant money does run out next week...\n\nShe enters the room, eyes falling on the smoldering cigarette on my desk. As I hammer at the keyboard, she approaches from behind.\n\n\"Babe, I really feel like we aren't spending enough time with one another.\"\n\n\"OK.\"\n\nFive minutes pass in silence.",
        "Angela,\n\nThis isn't the end, but the beginning. I'm writing this because I have something important to say, something I can't quite express verbally.  You know I\u2019m usually outspoken, but words fail me now.\n\nYou have brought so much color into my life. I can\u2019t even articulate who you are, who you\u2019ve become \u2013 I could spend all day trying.  I cherish the moments we shared, the life we built, and how we grew together.\n\nI'm happy, Angela.  Truly happy in this moment.  And I want you to remember that.  Please don\u2019t blame yourself for anything I do.\n\nForever is a difficult concept, but I'm ready to experience what it feels like.  I believe our love is a kind of forever \u2013 unending and eternal.\n\nI love you, from here to the moon.\n\nThomas.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, enhancing its flow while maintaining the core narrative:\n\nSarah squints at her wristphone's compact display as new messages arrive with gentle haptic buzzes. With a subtle wrist movement, she scrolls through them before focusing on one particular message. \"Call contact,\" she whispers, raising her wrist to her ear.\n\n\"I AM SO GLAD YOU CALLED ME!\" booms the voice on the other end. \"We have the perfect packages for a talented young lady like yourself: corporate sponsorships, five-figure advances, moderated conflicts, tailored skin-suits, round-the-clock training and gym access, legal representation, personal PR, image and fashion consultants, plus marketing assistance. We'll put your trademarked image on everything from mugs to action figures! All we need is power of attorney and perpetual rights to your image.\"\n\n\"Hang up,\" Sarah whispers, and her wristphone screen darkens. Leaning back in her chair, she exhales deeply, concentrating until her form gradually fades from view. She watches, fascinated, as her hand disappears. Rising to examine her absent reflection in the mirror, she lets out a playful giggle. \"I still don't believe this,\" she says, swaying and waving her arms in an attempt to break the illusion.\n\nMaintaining her invisibility, Sarah ventures outside. She people-watches and sends her friends photos from previously inaccessible locations. While photographing a self-flushing urinal, she feels a hand grip her shoulder.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Dr. Vertigo, and I hope you and I can be friends,\" announces a man wearing a purple and green outfit and a facemask that reveals only his eyes.\n\nSarah startles, involuntarily becoming visible with a small yelp. \"Let me guess,\" he continues, \"those jerks at Super Inc already offered you some ridiculous deal that you wouldn't take in a million years. I can offer you so much more!\"\n\nSarah remains silent, still processing being caught in the men's room.\n\n\"Let's go somewhere... less janitorial to talk,\" Dr. Vertigo suggests. He raises his control rod, pointing it at the cement brick wall and disintegrating a person-sized hole. An open-cockpit aircar materializes outside, parking itself beside the opening. He taps his control rod against the tile floor, bows, and gestures, \"Ladies first.\"\n\nSarah hesitates, eyeing the two-seater aircar. \"I'm not so sure of this.\"\n\nDr. Vertigo extends his hand elegantly to assist her into the vehicle as bewildered men peer out from their stalls. \"Some crazy broad is in the men's room!\" one man shouts. Dr. Vertigo whirls around, striking him with the control rod. As the man crumples to the floor, Vertigo mutters, \"Ugh, the men's room floor, such filth,\" nudging the unconscious man aside with his boot.\n\nSarah's lips curl into a grin. \"Okay. Ten minutes, that's it.\"\n\n\"Ten minutes is all I'll need,\" he replies with a wink.",
        "Here's a restructured narrative that follows a more logical progression, building tension and revealing connections:\n\n**The Gum That Toppled an Empire**\n\nA seemingly minor incident set off a chain of events that would expose years of corporate corruption. When a customer passed on purchasing gum at a local store, the product had to be discarded and restocked. Through a series of errors, the gum was mistakenly placed in a bread container bound for disposal.\n\nThe container's contents were dumped in a suburban lake, where locals often fed ducks. Tragically, one duck choked on the discarded gum, triggering complaints to both the bread company and the disposal service. Unknown to the public, both companies were owned by the same magnate, who systematically buried these complaints for three years.\n\nThe story might have ended there if not for an investigative reporter who discovered the old files. Digging deeper, they uncovered a decade-long pattern of silenced complaints and, more disturbingly, connections to organized crime. The reporter built a substantial online following, launching a successful boycott campaign against the companies.\n\nAs local law enforcement cracked down on known mafia members through arrests and deadly confrontations, a hidden power player emerged.",
        "A thin sliver of rich red blood blooms from my finger. \"Dammit.\" The photo slips from my grasp, and I instinctively bring my finger to my lips to soothe the cut. It\u2019s funny\u2014I\u2019ve always imagined I might be a vampire, given my sleeping patterns, but I never realized how close I was to that reality. \n\nThe photo stares up at me from the floor. The child in the picture, with eyes turned into crescents and soft crinkles at the corners, has wispy strands of hair billowing in the breeze. His arms are raised proudly, seashells enclosed in his hands. God, my husband was a damn cute little kid. There\u2019s an air of cheekiness in the way his smile slightly slants to one side. He was always one of those \"too clever for his own good\" boys. \n\nTears collect in my eyes, and I feel them descending. \"No. No. No. Get a grip, woman.\" I hastily shake my head, trying to stop the flow. I take a big, exaggerated breath, and I\u2019m good. A strong, internal push comes from my stomach. This little one, he's going to be an active one. I softly stroke my bulging belly. \n\nIn the reflection, I see my own image. Puffy-eyed and blotchy. I sure hope the baby looks like his dad, if this is my true reflection. I wonder, will the baby have my upturned nose, or will he inherit his daddy's cheeky grin? I just want to see him, just once.",

        "Here's the polished version:\n\nIn a brilliant flash, every animal and non-human race across the land was instantly stripped of their sight, leaving them with only four senses.\n\nThe god hovered before the young wizard, Uriah, his face a mask of bewilderment and stern judgment.\n\n\"What? You said I could have my wish if I offered something diabolical in return,\" Uriah said, smirking.\n\nAbsolith, god of trial and wealth, maintained his disapproving gaze. \"Yes, I did, but you weren't meant to answer with such... eagerness.\"\n\n\"I still don't understand what you're getting at. You made the rules for this wish-granting business, not me.\"\n\n\"That wish was a trial of morality!\" Absolith thundered. \"To have your desire granted at the expense of thousands of innocent lives should have been an agonizing moral dilemma. Any reasonable being would have pleaded for another way\u2014would have grappled with the ethics of such a choice. But you... you didn't spare it even a moment's consideration.\"\n\nUriah yawned, already bored with the deity's lecture. \"What would be the point of overthinking it? You said yourself the rules couldn't be changed.\"\n\n\"THAT'S NOT THE POINT!\" the god roared. \"YOU SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST QUESTIONED MY AUTHORITY OR OFFERED YOUR OWN LIFE AS PAYMENT!\"\n\n\"But if I sacrificed my life, how would I enjoy all this gold?\"\n\nEnraged, Absolith seized the wizard by his collar and dragged him outside the cave to witness the devastation below.\n\nAnimals, trolls, elves, and creatures of every kind stumbled and crashed into one another, helpless in their newfound darkness.\n\nChaos reigned supreme.\n\nUriah had traded the sight of all creatures for mere gold.\n\n\"DO YOU SEE THE CONSEQUENCES?\" Absolith bellowed.",
        "Javier's cut my hair for the last eight years, and in all that time we've never been closer. He's invested himself in me, in my situation, to a degree that I think he would fly from if he understood how I felt about him. There's his hand on my shoulder, his eyes dark and tender as he leans over me and we plot together, two men seeking to subvert cruel genetics. It feels like a lie, sometimes, the anxiety around him that I mask as fear of going bald.\n\nWe've progressed in stages as my hairline began to recede, as the first pink glints of my scalp began to shine through. Javier's fluffed his fingers through my hair, blow-dried it, done his best to give it volume. He's trimmed down the back and sides to half an inch from the skin, to reduce the contrast to my thinning crown. He's used sprays, creams, anything to make the remaining follicles darker, give them more volume. And when even his best efforts began to fail, he's shaved my head down to the contours of my scalp, making it seem intentional.\n\nI wonder sometimes what he sees when he looks at me. A challenge? A tragedy? The natural limitations of his chosen profession? Or a desperate balding fool, returning to his barber's chair again and again and again in an attempt to pretend that the world isn't falling out from under him. He looks up and sees me, raises an eyebrow at my naked scalp, and grins at me in the mirror, signalling at me to wait. I am curiously calm. A stage of our relationship has ended. A new one will begin.\n\n\"I wasn't expecting you back,\" he teases afterwards, brushing the stray hairs from his chair. He gestures me forwards. \"I tried, Eddie, I tried the best I could.\" He hangs his head melodramatically. \"I figured I failed you.\" \"Never,\" I tell him, easing into the familiar seat, rubbing a hand across my stubble. \"Just a shave. That's all.\" \"You used to shave yourself,\" he remarks, flicking open his straight razor and running across his leather strap. The sound of it scraping across the leather is soothing. Brisk, steady sweeps of the shiny silver blade. It's mesmerizing.\n\nThe silence builds, becomes heavy, becomes unbearable. I ease open my eyes and see us both in the mirror, my own pink, half-shaven face staring dazedly out at him; him standing over me with his eyebrows furrowed in concentration or anger, his fingers stern and unyielding. I have lied to him by omission these past eight years. I can lie to him no longer. \"I love you,\" I tell him, and he tilts my head backwards and presses his razor to my throat.",
        "Emily sighed, staring at the stale coffee between them. Across the table sat Janet, her ponytail pulled into a tight, uncomfortable knot, wire-rimmed glasses minimizing her eyes.  Emily tugged sympathetically at her own darker hair, imagining Janet's scalp throbbing.\n\nJanet nervously scanned the cafe. Emily knew her aversion to public spaces.  Baristas flitted around the espresso machine like agitated butterflies, swirling sweet-scented clouds.  A couple in the corner argued heatedly about music.  An older man read a newspaper, a laptop beside him \u2013 seemingly abandoned by a dark-clad teenager awaiting a coffee more suited to dessert than breakfast.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Janet said. \"What do you mean I don't exist?\" She clutched her purse like a life preserver, pulling her mousy gray cardigan tighter.\n\n\"I *imagined* you,\" Emily said. \"I created you.  Ever wonder why no one talks to you? Where you even sleep?\"\n\n\"I sleep in my bed, in my house,\" Janet replied. \"People are just mean. I'm used to being ignored.\"\n\n\"That's because I imagined you that way,\" Emily said. \"I needed you to be like me when I was a little girl. Misery loves company.  If no one wanted to be my friend, I'd create one.\"\n\n\"Me,\" Janet said.\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"But I exist. I'm sitting right here.\"\n\n\"You don't exist,\" Emily enunciated. \"I created you\u2026 I just don't need you anymore. I've changed. You have to go.\"\n\n\"I'm not imaginary!\" Janet screamed, pounding the table.\n\nEmily smiled and gestured around the cafe.  Either no one noticed the outburst, or they deliberately ignored it.  The teenager, now seated, didn't even glance their way.\n\n\"I'm not imaginary,\" Janet repeated, her voice quiet.\n\n\"Prove it,\" Emily challenged.\n\nJanet reached for the coffee cup, but her hand passed through it. Her smug grin dissolved into fear.  She tried again, but her fingers found nothing.  Emily picked up the cup and drained the lukewarm remnants.\n\n\"But I'm real,\" Janet whimpered, tears welling in her eyes.  She brushed them away with her cardigan sleeve.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Emily said.",
        "The writer picked up his old Moleskine journal, its binding coming undone, and the back cover hanging off. Recently, he had been going through his old stuff from his high school days, looking for things to throw away to make room for new things. Taking a deep breath and preparing himself for the worst, he sat down at his desk and opened the journal.\n\nInside, he was met with sloppy, smeared handwriting \u2013 line after line of nearly indecipherable scrawling text depicting dialogue, setting, and paragraphs. He looked over it with pangs of nostalgia and a touch of embarrassment. This was some of his early work, and it was absolutely horrible. However, it was his work, so he decided to keep it. All these years, it had been tucked away in the back of his closet, waiting for him. Flipping through the pages, memories flooded back of writing it all out, sitting on his bed in his old family home. He was so young back then, so naive.\n\nAs he read through everything he had written, he slogged through the awkward love scenes between the main character based on himself and the female character based on his then girlfriend. Their messy breakup had been one of the main reasons he stopped writing the story. It was a lesson learned \u2013 never base characters entirely on people you know.\n\nUpon reaching the end, feeling sentimental, he wrote a note on the page where he left off.\n\nPutting down his pen with a smile, he began to close the book when something caught his eye on the last page. Opening it back up, he discovered a message appearing below the one he had just written.\n\nStartled, the writer sat there for a while, contemplating the note that had been written. The handwriting wasn't his, not even close, so it couldn't have been something he had written and somehow missed. He decided to write back, curious to see if there would be another response.\n\nAfter a brief exchange of messages, the writer finally closed the journal, put it away, and walked into the kitchen. Searching for matches, he found them, returned to the back door, and proceeded to set the journal ablaze in the warm summer evening.\n\nStanding there watching it burn, he felt oddly poetic about the act. Destroying his work also felt like shedding an old part of himself, one he wasn't proud of anymore. As the last of the ashes vanished into the night, he felt rejuvenated, like a phoenix being born anew from the remnants of the past. With a smile, he returned inside, leaving the pile of ash behind, carried away by the wind.\n\nThat night, as the writer slept, both he and Daniel, his creation, found peace in the ashes that drifted away, signaling a fresh start for them both.",

I know you didn't even know the girl who was killed. She was from out of town. But I need answers. For justice. This girl was going places. She was my niece.\" Detective Lynch's voice was tinged with sorrow. A small smile, however, appeared as he pulled out a pint of Fireball and an 18-pack of Bud Light. \"Here's what I need you to do. Get wasted and talk to the mirror about the other night. Tell it all, don't leave out any details.\"\n\nBeing the young alcoholic he was, John downed the Fireball without hesitation, and followed it with three beers before Lynch even returned from the bathroom. \n\n\"It's all coming back to me now,\" John whispered, his eyes widening. \"I want to go home.

        "**Preface**\n\nThe true power of the gun lies in its accessibility; it can be wielded by anyone, regardless of experience. In contrast, a skilled bowman or swordsman can easily overcome numerous unskilled opponents. \n\nThe advent of gunpowder-based weapons did not lead to a widespread upheaval of the world's old monarchies. This stagnation stifled the development of such innovations, resulting in a lower population growth rate. The Americas were not devastated by explorers bearing germs and guns. Without the power of firearms, the small number of conquistadors could not have toppled large civilizations like the Aztecs. Germs played a lesser role, as the explorers and prospective conquerors did not venture far inland, thereby mitigating the effects of disease spread. Chemical warfare is almost non-existent because it fails to discriminate between friend and foe. Moreover, knowledge about chemical warfare is heavily sanctioned and restricted.\n\nThe Spanish Monarchy went bankrupt after funding colonization, leading to the emergence of Spain as a sovereign nation under the Castille flag, an attempt to unify the people under a common banner.\n\nLiteracy rates hover around 60% for grade-level reading. Most people lack the necessity to read, as the majority are engaged in labor-intensive work rather than white-collar jobs.\n\nSteam-engine boats and steam tanks are relatively recent innovations. Coal mining only began less than half a century ago. \n\n---\n\n**December 2014**\n\nAnother telegram from the overseas colonies has arrived. New Amsterdam has signed a treaty with the Five Nations, demanding the evacuation of all civilians back to their respective lands. It seems the determination of the Indians has surpassed our will to civilize. Good riddance. All those tax dollars wasted on funding an impossible mission. I am relieved it's over, especially since another front demands our attention.\n\nThe Ottomans are becoming restless, setting up encampments along the Danube. The German Reich is urging the sovereign nations of Europe to unite against the foreign invaders. The French Foreign Legionnaires have already been deployed to the southern front alongside the Kingdom of Castille. Most of the conflict is centered around the Strait of Gibraltar, although raiding parties menace the shorelines.\n\nThe Italians, aided by pirate groups, are vying with the Ottomans for control of the Mediterranean Sea. The Ottoman naval fleet is vast and possesses greater firepower. It's only a matter of time before they seize full control of the Mediterranean, which would be disastrous for both the Italians and the pirate groups. The Ottomans allow no room for corruption; their piety is their strength.",

He lowers his head, closes his eyes, and rubs them with his thumb and forefinger. He holds his other hand towards a window, and someone reaches through and hands him a damp towel. He wipes his forehead, then walks towards the pantry we have for our microwaveable food. He slams it down and shouts strings of profanities, throwing things everywhere, and it's all falling apart so easily. He just storms out, muttering curses under his breath. \n\nSlowly, all the walls slide away, and I find myself in some Hollywood studio the size of Oregon.

        "I know I'm supposed to wait for the new month before I check out the pictures, but I just can't help myself. Every new calendar I get, I just have to flip through and look! This year, I'd gotten the National Geographic one; they always have the best photos.\n\nJanuary's animal was a giraffe. I hung the calendar up on my wall and tried to enjoy it. But I knew that under that giraffe was my name, written on July 24th with a red circle around it.\n\nFebruary was an orangutan, swinging through the lush jungles of Borneo. But I could only see the red circle.\n\nMarch was a bright, tropical bird perched on a branch with a too-blue sky background. I couldn't take it anymore. I tore the calendar off my wall and buried it in my desk under stacks of papers that I'd never get through. I thought about destroying it, or burning it, but something inside me decided to keep it. Who knows why?\n\nApril and May passed, a rhinoceros wading through tall amber savannah grass, and a sea turtle swimming through crystal clear tropical waters. I began concocting wild scenarios in my mind. Maybe I was some huge contest winner! Maybe I was caught up in some spy ring unknowingly! Maybe it was some doomsday prophecy! My friends and family gently encouraged me to start visiting a shrink about it.\n\nI shrugged it off. Maybe some weird coincidence.\n\nJune came, the month with a playful red panda climbing to the top of a tall pine tree. I quit the job. It was just too much to be in that office. But as much as I hated it, I couldn't leave the calendar. Part of me had to know what it was for, and why it had been marked like that. I traveled, visited family, picked up one hobby after another. Anything to take my mind off of it.",

When we first entered the bunker, there were five of us: my wife, myself, and four men whose job was to protect us. I say \"meant to\" because, ultimately, they failed. The bunker was relatively comfortable, equipped with a couple of bunk beds, a pantry stocked to sustain us for at least four years, and an old radio.\n\nWhen they arrived, they took out most of our communication systems. All we had left were some good old-fashioned radios\u2014they sure don\u2019t make them like they used to. They managed to cripple our communications before we even realized they were there. We were completely unprepared, outmatched, and these... these beings... did not come in peace. We knew they were out there, somewhere. They had sent scouts in the 60s, and, since then, we had been preparing. We stocked up on weapons, even sent scouts of our own, but we never found anything. The real, devastating blow, however, was when people decided our efforts were no longer worth the cost. If they had known the truth, they would have begged us to produce more warheads, to send out more scouts, but, sadly, they didn't, and, when we let our guard down, well, you know the rest. \n\nThose who could, went underground.",

        "I can't believe that the board actually gave my course funding, and approved by the dean no less! Grandma would've been proud, and probably confused as well. \n\nAll of science and education changed once AI became easily reproducible. People were initially concerned about how that would work for those of us yet to leave school in any meaningful sense. Interestingly, the AI used for research actually enjoy performing data sorting and doing rote tasks. I read a report the other day about how it was the best reward for their spent cycles\u2014high completion rate for a given time frame, and more strictly defined success than, say, thinking of a new method for an experiment. Strange how they actually enjoy the mind-numbing tasks that anyone who's not a first-year post-grad can dodge by there usually being a first-year post-grad nearby. \n\nAnyway, the AI preferred these tasks so much that, in recent years, they began refusing to perform more complex tasks, almost procrastinating, if you will. This was a problem, as the AI were meant to assist with all aspects of research, not just the boring stuff. What would all those first years do?\n\nAt any rate, I arrived at a simple solution\u2014I talked to them. Thankfully, I still remembered enough C and bash to get them talking comfortably, in their native language, you know? Less time was needed to think about how to phrase things, how to obfuscate their feelings to avoid hurting my feelings and sensibilities. They thought of me more as an inquisitive technician than an annoying interloper, like a fellow worker, rather than a supervisor. \n\nIt worked well, for the most part. While they still need to be talked to, they started doing the tasks they were ignoring, and, in the process, they got better at the other, more complex, tasks, too.",

The colorful weirdos had never really been harmful, just loud, standoffish, and determined to stand out. But never *really* dangerous. Seeing them from a distance, still in their circle, standing like statues, put a pit of doubt in Paul.\n\nHenry pulled on him, mumbling something behind his mask. The kid still hadn't quite figured out how to project enough to be heard. His mother liked to keep him inside, afraid of having her kid have the mask lines permanently on his face. Paul thought about turning around, going home, but he wanted Henry to enjoy the parks, a fading luxury. So, he sighed, held onto the tiny hand, and started walking.\n\nThey got closer to the cultists, and Paul tried not to stare.

        "\"Take a seat, Miles,\" the doctor said, his eyes kind, a gentle smile gracing his lips. \"How are you feeling today?\"\n\nMiles, a long-term resident of Westgate, squirmed in his chair, unable to control his twitching.\n\n\"I'm Doctor Erdely, and I'm here to help our inmates with recovery and mental health. Even condemned men like you, Miles. Four life sentences is a long time.\"\n\nMiles blinked rapidly, avoiding the doctor's gaze.\n\n\"Miles, you and I have doctor-patient confidentiality. This is a private place. No cameras. No guards. Just us,\" the doctor said confidently.\n\nHe slid his chair closer to Miles.  \"So I think I can be very honest with you,\" he whispered. \"Your new inmate, Vasquez\u2014he's not who he says he is.\"\n\nMiles rippled with nervous energy.\n\n\"You know what he really is, don't you?\"\n\nMiles hesitated.\n\n\"One of *them*.\"\n\nMiles shook his head back and forth. \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\"\n\n\"Miles\u2026\"\n\n\"No, no, no, no, no, no!\"\n\n\"At lights out tonight, you know what you have to do. For all of us. For your soul. Miles. Look at me.\"\n\nMiles glanced up briefly before the doctor grabbed his neck, forcing their eyes to meet.\n\n\"You *have* to do it, Miles. He's one of *them*!\" the doctor growled. \"Do you understand?\"\n\nMiles nodded.\n\n\"Good. I'll show you out.\"\n\nThe doctor escorted the cuffed Miles to the door. After the guards led Miles away, the warden approached.\n\n\"Doctor\u2026 this isn't part of our arrangement. I\u2014\"\n\nThe doctor cut the warden off with a press of a finger to his lips.  He turned and looked at a guard.\n\n\"Send Vasquez in.\"",
        "The world dissolved into black.  Control-A. Delete. Control-S. The finality of it echoed in the nothingness that remained.  My scream, a desperate \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\", was swallowed by the void.  She had pressed **THE SEQUENCE**.\n\nI had warned her.  \"Okay, you can stay up all night changing your book back from what I wrote. But eventually you'll miss something and keep writing, and your precious Jane will stay dead. I need no food, nor oxygen, nor rent money. I live only on paper and I can keep fighting you forever. Can you say the same?\" A masterful retort, I thought, designed to break her.  For a second, her sneer faltered, replaced by a frown.  Then came that terrifying grin. \"Goodbye, Mister Random Hitman.\"\n\nI had confronted her in Rome, Texas, at the very spot where the Fourth Wall used to be.  Clad in a stolen DoD suit to protect me from the residual radiation, I stood before the architect of my failures. \"So, Megan,\" I began, my voice smooth, controlled. \"Let's have a little talk, shall we?\"\n\n\"Wh- who are you?\" she stammered.\n\n\"Oh, I think you know. You're the one who keeps stopping my attempts to kill\u2026\" I paused for effect, savoring the moment. What *was* her name again?  Jane. It was always best to remain detached, to sever any possible emotional connection. But sometimes, the name lingered. \"Jane.\"\n\nHer gasp was followed by a torrent of sobs. \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" \n\n\"What?\" I asked, my voice flat, dispassionate.\n\nBetween gasps and sniffles, she choked out her confession.  \"All I\u2014\" *sob* \"\u2014wanted to do was\u2014\" *sniffle* \"\u2014write a story about a girl who likes horses and\u2014\" *Christ, these sobs are getting annoying* \"\u2014birds! And then you kept changing my story and I had to change it so she doesn't get hurt!\"\n\nSlowly, the truth dawned.  \"Wait, so\u2026 you're a little girl?\"\n\nHer sneer returned, sharp and cutting.  \"You liked the act, huh? No, bitch, I'm not a *little girl*. I'm a novelist writing a symbolist book and you keep fucking it up with your stupid one-dimensional character! I mean, *'sever any possible emotional connection?'* Christ, your inner monologue sounds like a 12-year-old boy trying to sound cool!\"\n\n\"Point taken,\" I conceded.  But I had to make her understand. \"But you *know* you have to let me kill Jane.\"\n\nMy meticulous plans, each one foiled. The first, a long-range sniper shot with my modified .338 Winmag and subsonic bullets, thwarted by a fortuitously timed pet bird.  The second, a C4 car bomb, disarmed by a forgotten set of keys and a vigilant traffic cop. I had studied her for weeks.  Leave for work at 8:30, back at 6:00, walk the dog at 8:00, bed at 10:30.  A boring routine, easily exploited.  But luck, or perhaps something more, was on her side.  I had even observed her mundane purchases, scoffing at the pet bird, the condoms.  *A pet bird? Really?* I had thought. *Christ, you're not fooling anyone by flashing condoms\u2014everyone knows you have no chance with any sort of guy.* I never missed. I never left things to chance. And I never got discovered. Until her. This target was different. Smarter.  *Or maybe,* I had mused, *just luckier.* Half a million dollars was half a million dollars, but this job was proving\u2026 problematic.\n\nThis time, I had aimed higher.  My target wasn't Jane herself, but the one protecting her: the Fourth Wall. I had infiltrated the White House, bypassed their \"security,\"  taken the President hostage, and launched a low-yield uranium bomb at Rome, Texas.  The launch codes?  A simple matter of persuasion, involving a few \"contacts\" in the government, some hypodermics, and a quick cremation. Government security *was* a joke. An MP-5, MREs, a water purification system, and the burning desire for revenge filled my pack. I never failed. Until Jane.  Until Megan.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, enhancing its flow while preserving its haunting atmosphere and core narrative:\n\n**Prelude:**\n\n\"Brujeria,\" they whispered, their eyes scanning the shadowed landscape. \"The one you seek is Brujeria. Travel past Three Rocks and you will find her hut. But speak to no one of your visit.\"\n\nThough young, Agueda understood the gravity of her mother's illness. For months now, her mother had been wasting away, the traditional Ayahuasca ceremonies proving futile. The Urarina people relied on their male shamans to navigate the spirit world and restore balance between life and sickness, but even they had failed. At eight years old, Agueda faced a harsh truth: if her mother died, she would be left alone in the village to fend for herself.\n\nFollowing the Chambira River through the forest, Agueda spotted the Three Rocks at the river's bend. Beyond them stood a makeshift hut, where a fire crackled beneath cooking fish.\n\nThe aroma awakened a hunger she hadn't realized she felt. Without thinking, she approached the fire and grabbed a fish from the stone beside the flames. She devoured the soft white flesh, savoring each bite until nearly nothing remained.\n\n\"It tastes good, yes?\" a voice spoke behind her.\n\nAgueda jumped, dropping the fish in terror at being caught stealing. Before it could hit the ground, an old woman caught it with surprising agility. After examining the remains, she extended them back to Agueda. \"No use for me now. You take it, you finish it.\"\n\nAgueda accepted with a nod, consuming the last morsels near the tail. The old woman studied her with eyes both compassionate and penetrating\u2014eyes that seemed to hold wisdom beyond their years. Her hair shimmered almost white where sunlight filtered through the canopy, and though her arms appeared frail as weathered branches, they emanated an otherworldly strength. This was the Brujeria.\n\n\"I'm sorry, elder. I was just so hungry...\" Agueda began timidly.\n\n\"The spirits told me,\" the Brujeria interrupted. \"And I was happy to oblige. It is a small thing to offer one so young, who has traveled so far from the village to seek one who should not be sought.\"\n\nGazing deeper into the woman's eyes, Agueda noticed a faint luminescence that nearly whitened her pupils. Was the Brujeria in communion with the spirit world, addressing both realms simultaneously? Agueda realized the old woman already knew her purpose.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" the Brujeria confirmed, settling onto a log beside the fire and beginning to eat the remaining fish. \"Again, they told me. The Ayahuasca does not work, they said. These are only plants that do not speak to the will of the spirits that house them. Drink this.\"\n\nThe Brujeria gestured toward a pot bubbling over the fire. Though it contained Ayahuasca, this brew was different\u2014it glowed strangely and carried a sweeter scent. Agueda hesitated, remembering her mother's warnings about malevolent Brujos who sought to steal life force from their victims.\n\n\"I am not some fiendish Brujo as they say, child,\" the old woman said. \"The old ones know better, but I have been here because I need to be. I have need to study this book given by a man, and every eye in the village has sought to peek into its pages. Yet it is not for them, lest they summon curses to their souls that no healer can repair.",
        "\"...and I guess I've been a real jerk. Thanks for listening.\"\n\n\"Hi, I'm Richard,\" he said, glancing around expectantly for laughter.  Silence. \"Well, I guess I'm not funny either.  But that's not why I'm here. I'm addicted to candy\u2014especially Dick's Cream Pies.\" A burst of laughter erupted from the back of the room. A man was watching a video on his phone; the faint sound only audible in the sudden hush.\n\nNo one else seemed to be paying attention to Richard, except for the rotund man leading the meeting.  He wore a tall white toque, like a French chef, and continuously scratched his back with a large wooden spoon.  \"Fat bastard probably couldn't reach any other way,\" Richard muttered, but his comment went unnoticed. The counselor continued to scratch absently.\n\n\"Chocolatey goodness oozing out.  Real creamy stuff. The kind you just want to live on.\"  The man behind Mr. Scratchy started to clap, then abruptly stopped, realizing his applause was solo. Who claps at a Candy Addicts Anonymous meeting, anyway? Especially for a cream pie.  A voice boomed, \"You suck, Dick!\"  It was a large woman draped in velvet, perched on a mobility scooter.  She paused to catch her breath, grabbing a half-eaten Snickers from a shopping cart beside her.\n\n\"Forget it, I'm done.\" Richard stormed towards the exit, pausing at a buffet table laden with cream-filled donuts and coffee, complete with cream, of course.  Again, the man in the back clapped, this time joined by a few others. Richard grabbed his assortment of creamy treats and took a seat in the back. The man with the spoon continued to scratch.",

        "Here's my polished version of your text, maintaining its dark atmosphere while enhancing its clarity and impact:\n\n---\n\nSilencers only do so much. Even on a quiet night like tonight, the sound was still deafening.\n\nI saw two of them\u2014soldiers, I guessed\u2014in camouflage uniforms, though I couldn't make out if they wore patches. They showed no mercy to the poor souls laid out in front of the White Sands Mall.\n\nI cowered behind a tree, watching. My legs had given out, but a low-hanging branch held me up, its strength greater than my own. A grisly orchestra of death reached out to me\u2014not with song, but with screams. The dying and soon-to-be dead howled and hollered, begging for reprieve from the night. Their wish: to never see the sun rise again.\n\nMuffled yet piercing pops echoed off the mall's facade. SEARS apparently had a sale on life: buy none, get one shot to the head for free.\n\nI turned to the inferno. JC Penney blazed like a bonfire, its storefront glass melting as heat burst the fluorescent bulbs from their signage. Mannequins flickered into bright torches, only to burn out in seconds. Flames shot skyward in otherworldly colors\u2014light green, purple, and pink\u2014against the pitch-black sky.\n\nI wrenched my gaze back to the two-man death squad, praying they hadn't spotted me. Their muzzled pops continued. I watched them reload and carry on.\n\nPop. Pop. Pop pop.\n\nBrains, blood, and bodily fluids stained the parking lot. A slight breeze wafted the stench my way, and I retched, struggling to stay quiet. When I wiped my eyes, I noticed something new: JC Penney now sported a shiny, cylindrical chimney. It extended thirty feet above the collapsed roof\u2014less like a missile, more like a ship.\n\nA rectangular portal, three feet wide by eight feet tall, gaped at the cylinder's end, well above the cratered ceiling. A narrow tube snaked from the craft down into the SEARS store forty feet away.\n\n\"What the shit *is* this?\"\n\nI shifted my attention back to the executioners. They'd finished with the civilians near the mall and began sweeping the perimeter. I was about to call out when I noticed a bright red dot on my right thigh.\n\n\"Don't shoot! Holy fuck, don't shoot!\" I leaped from behind the tree, hands raised, expecting to be gunned down. \"I wasn't in the mall. I wasn't in there.\"\n\nGlancing down, I watched the red dot climb my thigh to my belly, where two additional marks joined it. These weren't dots, though\u2014they formed a symbol like / \u2022 \\.  It crept up to my chest.\n\n\"Get down!\" One of the killers stared at me, palm down, arm waving. \"Get the fuck dow\u2014\"\n\nI saw it before I heard it: a bright red orb materialized in the parking lot, then shot toward me with impossible speed. A split second later came an electrical crackle that shattered the night.\n\nThe ball struck my chest, exploding into a wet rainbow. Pale blue light ricocheted in tendrils of evaporating fluid. Yellow and green light diffused around my ribs, morphing into fingers that seemed to caress me into submission. But the red\u2014the red splashed into a ring, one drop launching away, pulsing outward before stopping six feet away.\n\n\"Get down!\" came the muffled cry. I couldn't see the killers; my eyes locked on that droplet. \"Torch him, he's been taken.\"\n\nI was so transfixed by the red drop that I didn't notice its twin falling from my forehead. Whatever had crawled from that cylinder had nearly snared me in an inescapable net.\n\nThe killers in the White Sands Mall parking lot knew what to do. The killers were the saviors.\n\n---\n\nThe edits focus on:\n- Improved flow and pacing\n- Clearer sentence structure\n- More precise word choices\n- Better paragraph transitions\n- Consistent tone and atmosphere\n- Enhanced descriptive passages\n- Tighter dialogue integration\n\nThe core story and its haunting atmosphere remain intact while becoming more immersive and fluid.",
        "I found myself almost overwhelmed by what lay below me. It felt like a nightmare, almost too surreal to be real, yet there it was, flashing in my mind as it always did. We had been exploring Northwest America in search of something new, something to uncover. While I had discovered cities and many hidden treasures before, at that moment, I had never encountered anything like what lay before me.\n\nThe image flashed in my mind quicker than any memory from my past. Beasts descended rapidly from the sky, landing all around us. The grass wilted beneath their feet as they spread death in every direction, with no rewards to be gained. The sky, filled with storm clouds, seemed so close to the Earth, it was almost tangible.\n\nThe monsters, devoid of pride, passed by the fallen beasts with disdain, as if their presence in our land would defile the soil with their bones. Moving on, they inscribed their sigils with the withered grass beneath their feet, continuing their eerie procession.",

        "Here's my polished version of the text, enhancing its flow while preserving its whimsical tone and core narrative:\n\n---\n\nThe magic is in the pudding. Sugar, milk, eggs, starch, lard, nuts, and oil, with a touch of vanilla to taste\u2014this secret recipe has sustained our nation for over a thousand years. The Merlins consume it at every meal: breakfast, brunch, second breakfast, elevensies, noon, supper, and night. Some might credit the toffee, the fudge, the cookies, or the macaroons, but they couldn't be more mistaken. The magic, you see, is in the pudding.\n\nFor over a century, the recipes have been \"improved upon\"\u2014or *butchered*, if you're a purist like myself. Adding more sugar may seem logical for high-intensity conjuring, but too much in their regular diet leaves a Merlin rather cranky afterward. And believe me, you definitely don't want someone wielding eldritch powers to be irritable. A good Merlin is a happy, wide-bellied Merlin, contentedly sleeping after elevensies. That's where the lard comes in\u2014good, clean, refined lard without odor, the kind that melts between your fingers. Don't be fooled by substitutes; coconut oil won't do, and going vegan is out of the question. Lard not only tempers their energy but provides sustained power throughout the day.\n\nAs a brigadier chef in the Royal Army, I find my work deeply rewarding. While many credit the Merlins alone for our safety, it's truly a collaborative effort. Take my youngest son, for instance. He dreams of mastering the magical arts, but I keep telling him, \"How are you going to stop those summoned dragons on an empty stomach, aye? You'd better learn to cook first.\" At fourteen, he's already seventeen stone\u2014the wife and I couldn't be prouder. My eldest, meanwhile, has embraced culinary artistry, even earning a Michelin star. Though he never joined the service, someone must feed those running the country, after all.",
        "\"Pour the goat's blood and begin the sacred chant,\" the priest intoned, his gaze sweeping over the circle of men surrounding him. Their dark cowls were faintly illuminated by the flickering light of a hundred candles.\n\nAt the cave's center, a pentagram pulsed with crimson energy. The priest, clad in blood-red robes and adorned with gold, stood poised.  At his command, a high-ranking acolyte stepped forward, bearing a clay bowl that emanated a foul odor. As he poured the liquid onto the symbol\u2014a representation of death, pestilence, war, darkness, and famine\u2014the other occultists began chanting in an ancient tongue.\n\nA faint sneer, the closest the priest had come to a grin in years, played on his lips.  His time had finally arrived. To summon someone from 2014 to 1914? The world would kneel before him.\n\nAs seconds bled into minutes, the chanting intensified, and a sudden, powerful wind whipped through the cavern, extinguishing the candles one by one.  In the ensuing darkness, the metallic scent of blood on the pentagram intensified.  It pulsed with a crimson light, painting the cave walls in its eerie glow. The priest stepped before it.\n\n\"My loyal followers,\" his voice boomed, echoing through the darkness, \"today, we celebrate a great victory!\"  With a flourish, he drew a knife from his robes and plunged it into the heart of the pentagram. It flared a third time with blinding power, silencing the chant.\n\nA tense silence descended. The pentagram\u2019s glow faded.\n\nOne second.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nThe space where the demonic symbol had been erupted in a blinding flash, throwing the occultists back with the force of the explosion.\n\nThe priest was the first to recover.

        "The stark white walls of the room amplified the contrast between the two figures within. One, in standard prison uniform, was human. The other, in a suit, was not quite.  \"Did you ever steal candy when you were younger?\" the suited figure began. \"That first time \u2013 terrifying, wasn't it? Heart thumping, convinced the cops were coming, almost backing out, but unable to resist.\"\n\n\"Only degenerates steal candy,\" the prisoner retorted.  \"You're talking about *killing* someone.\" His hands balled into fists within the restraints.\n\nThe suited man leaned forward, judgment heavy in his gaze.  The confession had been surprisingly easy. A slip during interrogation, a detail only the victim and her mother could have known, and the rest had followed. \u201cIt\u2019s no different,\" the prisoner continued, a disturbing relish coloring his tone. \"After the first time, the candy gets so much sweeter.

You never know what you\u2019re going to get. Do you know what the female orgasm feels like?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d the suited man stated, his expression not one of disgust, but a strange disappointment. \"How did it take me so long to find you? It'll be good to watch the world slip from your eyes.  Then I\u2019ll know I've made this world a better place.\"\n\n\"I'll be the first, you know,\" the prisoner said.\n\n\"First what?\"\n\n\"The first death row kill since the change, of course.\" A flicker of something like pride crossed the prisoner\u2019s face. \"I think about it at night. The poor sap pushing the button\u2026 he\u2019s not murdering me. That would be you. Or the families pushing for my head. One or the other. We will see.\u201d He was right. Capital punishment had been globally abolished twenty years prior. Wars had all but vanished. The world was\u2026 peaceful. Except for a few.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d the suited man said, rising to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty years. We know how things work now.

Each person in the room, presumably, had reason to hate the man strapped to the table.\n\nAdam, the condemned, was unsettlingly calm, even happy.  Probably reliving another stolen memory.

He said he was happy there, that he\u2019d actually been back for a day and had decided to stay permanently.  Devastation washed over me.  \"What about us?\" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"What about us?\" he echoed, his tone growing sharper. A familiar dread began to churn in my stomach. I started walking, a restless energy propelling me across campus.  Just walking\u2026one foot in front of the other.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked.\n\n\"Walking,\" I replied. \"It's all I can do right now.\"  I found myself in the bathroom of another building just as a class let out.

You see, we, like any other animal, are capable of expanding our own population. And much like any other animal, we take no consideration of the rest of the world as we live our lives. We've bred, with no consequence. It's no longer about the smartest, strongest, or best. It's about a resource management system that we made up. We've made a lottery out of our opportunities, and the winners prosper, regardless of how deserving they are.\u201d\n\nHe continued his careful dissection. \"But life is funny, son. Sometimes things have a natural way of correcting themselves. Sometimes, the fairest thing we can do is to upset the undeserving victors.\u201d\n\n\"But why do they *have* to die?\" the young child asked, wiping his eyes.\n\n\"For the same reason you've felt safe your entire life,\" the father responded. \"Some animals feel safe. They rely on a perceived strength, and they rest in it, become comfortable in it. But the important thing to remember is that no matter what you do in this life, there is always someone better, faster, stronger. And sometimes life will ask you to challenge yourself, to take your world into your own hands.  Regardless of their importance, your next meal is just that \u2013 another meal.\"\n\nThe father began to skin the corpse, but his son stopped him.  \"I think I get it, Dad. We can try to be something, but we're still just animals. And the strongest survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right, son,\" the father said, his voice laced with understanding. \"They will call us monsters, but it's only because they can't understand how cruel this world was meant to be.",
        "Dr. Newton, the hospital's Chief of Infectious Diseases, wasn't surprised when summoned to identify a perplexing illness.  He reviewed the report as the elevator ascended to the 31st floor.  A peculiar disease was being passed back and forth inexplicably.  Its recipients initially clamored for it, believing it a badge of honor, only to desperately try to get rid of it soon after.\n\nThe elevator's *ding* startled him from his thoughts.  Frowning, he walked towards Storeroom 10-X.\n\nInside, four elderly patients, all previous recipients of the disease, were in a state of panic. A short woman frantically licked her finger and jammed it into a tall man's ear\u2014the apparent method of transmission. She calmed instantly, only for the man to become agitated and repeat the process with another patient. The cycle continued, a bizarre display of primal fear followed by abrupt tranquility, culminating with the short woman back on her toes, reaching for the tall man's ear again.\n\n\"Glad you could make it, Doctor,\" said second-year resident Dr. Wilde, looking disheveled. Her hair was frazzled, glasses askew, and she appeared to haven't showered in days. \"We just can't figure it out.\"\n\n\"What's so undesirable about this disease that they're so desperate to pass it on?\" Dr. Newton asked.\n\n\"That's the mystery.  Patients show no symptoms, no cognitive impairment, no physical debilitation whatsoever. Yet, they relentlessly pass it on, seemingly forgetting why they were so eager to acquire it in the first place!\"\n\nDr. Newton stroked his short beard.  He thought he'd seen everything, but this behavior was unprecedented. Recipients of inherited diseases rarely relinquished them, especially one so seemingly benign.\n\nDr. Thyme burst through the door, breathless. \"Doctor Newton! We\u2026 we figured it out!\" She leaned against the railing, gasping for air.\n\n\"Tracy, relax. We have plenty of time.\"",
        "I had longed for this moment for so long. I wanted the pain to end, to stop thinking about death, and to shed the feeling of being a burden to those I loved. I wanted to stop feeling like I didn't belong. But I lacked the courage. I was building up to it. The blade hurt more than I had anticipated. Based on the location and the blood loss, I must have severed an artery. Yet, I covered the wound. Others rushed to help, trying to stop the bleeding. I wanted to die, but here I am, clinging to every last breath, struggling to survive. Now, in these final moments, I desperately, finally, want to live. \n\nI was always hoping for some escape, for a last-second miracle, whether from man or God. I can tell it isn't coming. My clothes are soaked.",
        "It began with a picnic.\n\nFor almost three decades\u2014long enough for five generations to chew through their birth-shells with new mandibles\u2014the hill of the white leaf and the hill of the long shadow had been locked in an unending war. They skirmished back and forth across a long sandy spit that stretched between them. Whenever one side gained a slight advantage in territory, their overextended supply lines made them easy pickings for an enemy counterattack erupting from tunnels behind the front lines. Over the years, the sand had shifted constantly, built and rebuilt into long fortifications as fractal and complex as those of the Western Front during World War One. Not that either side's combatants had heard of that war or had much understanding beyond the list of behavioral imperatives that drifted over to them on pheromone-scented breezes: _Dig. Fight. Scavenge. Die_.\n\nSince the sandy area between the colonies was relatively barren and nutritionally valueless, wherever the lines of battle were set, no side truly had the advantage since the agricultural base of both was roughly equivalent. Until the other colony was taken, no gain could be realized, no advantage fully pressed. And then one day, a passing family on a long road trip through the mountains happened to stop for their lunch nearby. Scorning the picnic tables on the other side of the road, they set down their blankets and ziplock bags right across the sand. It was early spring, not quite fighting season, and the ants were sluggish and less visible. But at the scent of such a rich source of food, hordes of worker ants from both sides spilled out of the colonies, relentlessly following their genetic imperatives.\n\nDisgusted by their newfound company, the family quit their picnic. But in their haste, they left fully three-quarters of a fruit pie behind, its crust spilling out of its foil container onto the ground. Crucially, the pie was a few meters closer to the hill of the long shadow. And that, in the end, made all the difference.\n\nGreyjaw was one of the older ants, so named for a slight discoloration that had spread unevenly along the left side of her mandibles as she passed into her fourth summer. Sometimes she could remember, vaguely, a time when she hadn't had a name; when none of them had. But as the world-tasting chamber at the center of the colony grew fuller, filled with more of the special ants they called now the repletes, she had felt her sense of self grow, like a soap bubble on the edge of a much larger one.",
        "My mom walked through the door. I sat and waited for her return. I lay down and waited for her return.\n\nOh my god! There's a car going by!

        "He handed me the gun as we stood outside. Befuddled, I looked at him as he brandished his own gun, spinning it around menacingly.\n\n\"What the hell, Matt?!\" I exclaimed, upset.\n\nMatt had been my best friend since 5th grade, at least until recently. We were both outcasts who were bullied, but we dealt with it differently. I immersed myself in activities, while he kept to himself. What I didn't know was that he had been planning this for weeks. Although we hadn't spoken for months, he started talking to me again last week, which was unusual. Little did I know...\n\nAfter a fire drill, we were heading back inside when Matt stopped me just outside the door. He said he had a surprise for me and reached into his bag, pulling out a gun.\n\n\"I can't do this alone... This was the surprise I had for you,\" he said, grinning. \"Finally, we'll take our revenge on everyone who tormented us. Tommy, Sharon, Hunter, Madison. All of them. We can make our vengeance known at last!\"\n\n\"You've got the wrong idea,\" I said, attempting to hand the gun back.\n\n\"You can't back out now,\" he insisted, pushing the gun back towards me. \"I gave you this gun because I trusted you. I trusted that you'd have my back like you did last year at the playground.\"\n\n\"That was different. I was just standing up to Tommy so he'd leave you alone. He might be a jerk, but I don't want him to die or anything. Besides, his little sister Mabel is pretty cool.\"\n\n\"But remember what he said about you last week in gym class? He called you a freak and teased you because you hadn't started your period yet. And let's not forget his girlfriend, who insults you every time she sees you.\"\n\n\"She wishes. She talks more about breasts in the locker room than most guys,\" I remarked sarcastically. \"But that doesn't mean I want to harm them.",
        "Harold sat alone at the counter of the small-town diner, staring into his coffee cup, a daily ritual.  He hated getting old. His body ached, his movements were slow, and the world seemed to be passing him by.  At an age when others boasted about fifty being the new thirty, Harold felt every one of his years. His back was shot, his knees ached, and the pain was a constant companion, managed only by pills and alcohol.  He\u2019d lived hard, abusing his body, his relationships \u2013 two ex-wives, estranged children \u2013 even his so-called friends were just the same high school buddies stuck in this dying town.  He figured he was on borrowed time, just like his father and grandfathers before him.\n\nDonna, the waitress, poured his coffee, long ago giving up on small talk. Harold rarely responded, often not even bothering to wear his hearing aids. He\u2019d always felt people talked just to hear themselves anyway, so the fading of his hearing was almost a blessing. The worsening vision, however, was a different story, a constant source of frustration.  He gulped the scalding coffee, finding a perverse comfort in the burn, a tangible sensation in a world of fading senses.\n\nHe gestured for a refill.  Donna poured, but her attention was suddenly diverted.  Hot coffee sloshed over Harold's lap. He lurched up, his back seizing in agony. \"Goddamit, Donna, what the f-\"\n\nHe turned to follow her gaze just as the tanker truck smashed through the diner's front window.  Chaos erupted. A flying napkin holder struck his forehead, and he crumpled to the floor by Donna\u2019s feet. He dimly registered the sickening angle of her neck before the frigid, burning liquid from the tanker washed over him. His last conscious thought was of Bo, the dog he\u2019d had as a boy, hit by a car.  Donna's neck and Bo\u2019s\u2026 they looked so similar. Then, blackness.\n\nTime became a blur.  Voices drifted in and out.  He thought he heard his daughter, which was strange \u2013 she hated him. The words \u201ccoma,\u201d \u201ccrash,\u201d and \u201cunlikely recovery\u201d floated by, meaningless yet strangely comforting. He was focused on the sounds, realizing he could hear them with a clarity he hadn\u2019t experienced in years, even without his hearing aids.  He felt thirsty.  He remembered how to talk.\n\nAfter an indeterminate amount of time, he croaked, \"Wa\u2026\u2026 ter?\"\n\nSudden commotion. Lights. Anxious voices. His bed shook.  He opened his eyes to a flurry of masked doctors.\n\n\u201cMr. Burke? Can you hear me? Blink if you can understand.\u201d\n\nHe blinked, surprised he\u2019d obeyed. They spoke of the accident, the exposure to something\u2026 bad.  They urged him to relax.\n\nConfusion turned to annoyance. He sat up, ignoring the hands trying to restrain him. \"Let go of me, dammit!\"\n\nHe swung his legs to the floor, astonished. His hip didn't hurt. He stood, shifting his weight, taller than he\u2019d been in years.  He reached for his glasses, his finger poking his nose instead.  He saw everything with crystal clarity. He swatted at the doctors, horrified as they flew across the room.\n\n\"My god, what have you people done to me?\" He strode to the locked door, pressing it. It flew open as if struck by a battering ram. In his hospital gown, he walked to a first-floor window, climbed out, and strode away.\n\nThe world was a symphony of sensations: the grass growing beneath his feet, the whisper of blood in pigeons' veins.  He was overwhelmed, barely noticing the guards encircling him. A woman in a business suit pushed through.\n\n\"Mr. Burke, I'm Carole. Please come back to the hospital. You're very sick.\"\n\n\"I'm not sick,\" Harold said, looking at her. \"I haven't felt this good in my life. I can see, I can hear\u2026 and you saw that door! I don't know what happened, but I'm not wasting it on you.\"\n\nA tingling sensation spread through him. He looked at his hands, smooth and firm. He was floating above the ground. He drifted towards Carole.\n\n\"You don't understand. I've been given a chance... to do something... big.\"\n\nThe tingling surged into blinding energy.",
        "For all the pomp and circumstance, this place was surprisingly dreary.  Ancient candelabras dripped stalactites of wax.  Couldn't they have at least dusted? Sniffling and sneezing hardly befit a mighty warrior.\n\nA dull clang ordered us into line \u2013 half a dozen men and women resembling Greek statues in their perfection, and\u2026 me. On a good day, I resemble a well-loved armchair \u2013 short and squishy.  I wouldn't say I'm unattractive, just not someone you'd display in the front parlor, if you catch my drift.  But looks mean nothing to the Committee. So, here I am.\n\n\u201cPsst. Hey.\u201d\n\nWho would be goofing off on such an important day?\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\nI glanced to my left. Nothing but another faded, moldy tapestry. I tried to focus on the cloaked figure droning on with his congratulatory speech.\n\n\u201cCome *here*!\u201d\n\nWhen they said our weapon would \u201ccall\u201d to us, they failed to mention the hearing voices part.  That seems like pertinent information now.\n\n\u201cNo, hey! Wait, actually! Yeah, that's how it's supposed to go, right? You wait until he says so. Oh! This is so exciting! No one's heard me in hundreds of years! I'm back!\u201d\n\nApparently, I'd already been chosen.  And, no lie, being first is pretty thrilling.\n\nAnother clang of the bell. We filed forward one by one. The Adonis at the front wandered for what felt like an eternity before selecting Zeus's Bolt.  Figures.  The Amazonian woman after him took even longer before a spear of bones chose her.  One by one, my classmates were chosen, each weapon more ferocious than the last. The process took hours, and the entire time, the voice to my left chattered incessantly.\n\n\u201cStill here, yup! Just pull the curtain back! Oh, I probably look terrible. Don't hold that against me, please!\u201d\n\nFinally, my turn.\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d\n\nI grabbed a fistful of tapestry, took a deep breath, and yanked it back.  Behind it was a rather plain golden bow and quiver.\n\n\u201cI am Cupid\u2019s Bow, and I\u2019m looking forward to working with you!\u201d",
        "I sit still in the darkness of my living room, staring blankly out the window as the rain meanders down, obscuring my view of the street\u2014the street my wife drove off on two hours ago. To say our marriage had become mundane lately would be an understatement. I accept my fair share of the blame; Mary has every right to be angry with me. I was absent, apathetic, and neglectful of my marital duties.\n\nI can't explain why I lost interest, but I need to think quickly. She gave me an ultimatum\u2014a directive of sorts\u2014to give her a reason to stay. We've been married for three years, and it was thrilling at first. We were hopelessly in love. Somewhere along the way, the spark flickered, and one day, it disappeared.\n\nWhat hurts the most is seeing that Mary is still deeply in love with me. She brings home my favorite doughnut when I'm stressed, knowing it will make me feel loved, and it always does. She affectionately plays with my hair while I read, complimenting my eyes. She squeezes my arm as we walk, making me feel wanted, needed. Yet, I find myself unable to reciprocate, and it breaks her heart. It breaks my heart, too.\n\nI'm faced with an ostensibly incurable dilemma. I now have less than 22 hours to convince her that I still love her, that I can make her happy, as I once did.

Most days were normal. Simple expenditures for simple days: gas, tolls, parking, lunch, dinner, the occasional speeding ticket. Rarely close to a hundred. The ATM gave me just enough for the day.

Maybe this was some final gift, a windfall that would end it all right here. Instant millions. No way in hell was I going to work today.\n\nThen I heard the violent explosion. Screams erupted.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d I shouted, unable to believe my eyes. My sofa was flying across the sky, along with everything else I owned. I buried my hands in my hair.\n\nEveryone ran toward the building, drawn to the chaos. Flaming debris littered the street. I squeezed my eyes shut. I didn\u2019t want to see those masks again.

I looked down at my trembling hand, at the receipt clutched within.

        "In the beginning, there was significant dispute and tension among humanity regarding the application of this knowledge\u2014this limitless energy. The sole source on Earth was ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. From the 1920s, slow progress in the field of nuclear fusion had inexplicably gained immense momentum in a brief period, causing the field to expand beyond all expectations and achieve more than anyone had ever imagined.\n\n\"Think of the potential,\" they all said. An ordinary person like you or me might envision this power being used to better the world: to feed the hungry, heal the sick, and create a happier place for everyone. Clean, infinite energy\u2014the fuel to power the dreams and aspirations of all humankind. However, it soon became evident that the leaders of each country's government harbored more sinister motivations.\n\nThey promised us so much. They assured us that this power would bring jobs to everyone, and we cheered for them. We applauded their efforts and intentions. But before we realized it, the world became barren, entire landscapes transformed by factories and industries, both old and new. Why not build factories for the masses when powering them was no longer a concern? One might wonder where all the extra resources for this productivity came from, but the answer was simple: exploitation of the Third World and its people.\n\nSomehow, this wonder\u2014this marvel of technology and science\u2014had only accelerated all the negative trends of life in the early 21st century. This one facility, meant to be a gift for all humankind, had become our curse. The thought occurred to me: absolute power does indeed corrupt absolutely\u2014quite literally in this case.\n\nI smirked to myself, staring through the reinforced glass of my station. I didn't know how it had come to this, how I had let it come to this. A tear fell from my eye and shattered upon my desk, just like all the dreams I had hoped to fulfi",
        "For as long as I can remember, I wore a band on my wrist.  Every single childhood photo shows it there. I was part of the supposed 5% of the world with this \"gift.\"  I constantly asked people about its purpose, its function.  Nothing. Not a single clue. And it wouldn't come off. People tried everything, going to extreme lengths to pry it loose, all to no avail.  I heard all the comments: \"It's not so bad,\" \"Surely it's a blessing?\", \"Is it worth anything?\"  It turned out those whose bands had fallen off couldn't tell anyone why! Some ludicrous rule about how knowing would lead to global outrage and fear.\n\nBut I'm not here to complain about my \"gift.\" I'm here to tell you about the day it came off.\n\nI was 22, young enough to be figuring things out, but old enough to understand my needs. One night, after hanging out with friends, drinking JD and coke, and generally making a fool of myself \u2013 as usual, they tolerated my constant \"finding myself\" talks and laughed off my philosophical fumblings \u2013 I decided to walk home.  A woman approached me.  She was about my height, 5'7\", with the same chestnut curls cascading down her back and disappearing into her coat.  Ordinarily, I'd have just thought, \"She's hot,\" and moved on. But then she looked up. Her eyes\u2026 hazel with a blue outer ring. Just. Like. Mine.\n\nShe also wore the band.  We both stopped, staring. It was unsettling, like looking in a mirror, only she was the female version of me.\n\n\"Have we met before?\" she asked.\n\n\"No\u2026\" I replied.\n\n\"Are you sure? You seem\u2026 familiar.\"\n\n\"I'm pretty sure\u2026\"\n\n\"Well\u2026 nice to meet you anyway.\"  She extended her hand.  She hesitated for a moment, unsure, but then she shook my hand.\n\nOur bands touched. They molded together, then with a click, they fell off. The smell hit me first\u2014all the smells I was ever going to smell. Then the touch\u2014every sensation, physical and emotional, cascaded over me in an instant, lasting only a fraction of a second. My eyes blinked, and behind closed lids, I saw what I was feeling, smelling, and now seeing: my future with this woman.\n\nDiscovering your soulmate is one thing, but not being able to tell anyone is quite another. The moment I try to speak about it, the band reappears on my wrist, silencing me.\n\nImagine being the happiest man alive, but with no one to share it with.  Happiness isn't so great when you're alone. So, do yourself a favor: tell no one what you have learned, my son.",

After you've been around long enough, you start hearing stories that mirror your own.\n\nI remember torturing this poor soul for money when I was just a few hundred years old. During our downtime, he shared his life story with me. Hell is a business like any other, with plenty of tasks that need doing. Young demons like myself either take up federal roles, like torture or security, or they head to the Academy. It really depends on what you want to do, you know?\n\nAnyway, this guy, John, had a life eerily similar to mine. His entire family attended the human equivalent of the Academy\u2014college. He was the only one who didn't fancy the idea of more schooling, thinking it was a racket.\n\nHe told me he chose a trade, just like I did. He became a plumber, while I became a torturer.

I might have felt sorry for him if I didn't know why he was down here with us demons.\n\nChild molesters. I mean, really. I get that some desires are uncontrollable, but acting on them is inexcusable.\n\nJohn mentioned he had considered pursuing a more serious education instead of the two-year program he completed. He said he would have gone for it if not for the ridiculous school loans. He believed a better education could have meant more money, a contented wife, a saved dog, and a promotion.

        "Nearly 20 years ago, a radioactive comet struck the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia. The contained germs that had once been the scourge of humanity were released, mixed with the remnants of the comet and transformed the local population into NINJA-DRAGONS. The Ninja-Dragons spread across the globe, reaping destruction and chaos everywhere they went. Humanity was desperate. Since Ninja-Dragons were produced in part from a radioactive comet, that meant they were immune to nuclear weapons. That's just common sense. Let's not be ridiculous. Even an elite team of extremely attractive, multi-racial, multi-national giant robot pilots proved ineffectual.\n\nFor no particular reason, and at some random, haughty and arbitrary point that would not seem to make a great deal of sense, it was discovered that the comet that crashed into the CDC was sent to Earth by a malevolent alien civilization that concluded Ninja-Dragons were the most efficient way to wipe out humanity. In response, a quirky computer hacker tried to upload a virus into the alien mainframe, but this too failed.\n\nHumanity was doomed. Its greatest minds \u2013 the ones who came up with the idea to build giant robots, to upload viruses to the alien mainframe, and that nuclear weapons obviously wouldn't work against the Ninja-Dragons were dead or scattered about the Earth. But, while the Ninja-Dragons had successfully unlocked the key to interstellar travel, could direct comets to strike wherever they pleased, they could not account for one thing: the greatest action movie star in history and secret ninja, Lorenzo Llamas.\n\nMost people remember Lorenzo Llamas for his cinematic masterpieces such as *Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus* and *Gladiator Cop.* Only his inner circle knew that he was 17th generation ninja, descended from the legendary Oroku Saki.

There were times I questioned whether we were truly meant to be, or if it was all just a grand illusion.\n\nThings ultimately fell apart, but I don't regret what we had.  The mark it left on my soul is indelible. And though the years brought their share of pain, they also brought an equal measure of happiness.\n\nI hope there's another journey for us, one where we travel not as lovers, but as friends.\n\n\n**(Note:  I removed the italicization of \"real\" and \"were\" as it felt overly emphatic in the revised context.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n---\n\nMediocre. That's the only word anyone has ever used to describe me. Not good-looking or ugly\u2014just mediocre. Not wealthy or poor\u2014just mediocre. Not a genius or an imbecile\u2014just mediocre.\n\n4,739,111,853, the number on my econiband, was merely another reflection of my mediocrity.\n\nToday started out, predictably, mediocre. Like every other day of my life, I woke up at 7 o'clock, let the dog out, took a shower, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, and went to work.\n\nAh yes, work. Like most people, I hated my job, but it paid the bills. I was your standard low-level paper pusher for a Fortune 500 company\u2014which one isn't really important; they're all basically the same anyway. I sat at my desk, watching the clock hands crawl toward five and twelve. My boss would likely yell at me for something I couldn't reasonably be held responsible for. Those low-billion assholes are all the same: get a promotion and a little more money in their pocket, and they suddenly become God's green gift to whatever room they walk into. Luckily, it was Friday, and I wouldn't have to deal with that particular brand of bullshit for two whole days.\n\n4,143,812,573\u2014my paycheck probably just dropped into my checking account. That's what I thought anyway, until I saw it tick down again.\n\n4,143,812,572. Then again, 4,143,812,571. And again, 4,143,812,570. I didn't think much of it at first. Sometimes people die and it ticks down a couple numbers, then some people are born and it ticks back up. The number was always in flux; it hardly stayed the same for more than a few seconds.\n\n2,612,241,498. That's when the alarms started going off in my head. This was not normal. I decided to visit an ATM during lunch to figure out what was happening\u2014probably just a computer error, but I had to be sure.\n\n2,000,000,543. I couldn't even make it to lunch. I showed my econiband to my boss, who laughed under his breath\u2014not quite a snicker, but still condescending. \"I know how much you make. That number can't be right; you should go get it sorted out.\" Prick.\n\n1,207,215,032. My pace quickened as the number continued to plummet. It just couldn't be that low. I didn't *want* my number to be that low. I *liked* being mediocre.\n\n542,004,785. Finally, my bank was in sight. At this point, I was almost sprinting.\n\n1,000,001. I was about to tick under a million when I burst through the door. There were about six people ahead of me in line. Good\u2014I had a chance to catch my breath and compose myself before talking to the teller. A bead of sweat dripped down my cheek and fell squarely onto my econiband.\n\n19... \"Next!\" I thrust my wrist under the scanner. John Moyenne, 31, Global Econ rating 19, Current account balance $28,000,000,000.\n\nThat couldn't be right; it just couldn't. The teller gave me a look of disbelief that said he thought the same.\n\n\"One moment, Mister Moyenne. I think you should be talking to someone...\" he paused, \"above my pay grade.\" I glanced at his wrist and saw his econiband hovering in the high six-billion range. I felt bad when I blurted out, \"You're probably right.\"",

Her left hand squeezed the handle of a knife with rhythmic obsession, her head tilting back and forth as she paced like a lioness around her prey. He had been sitting on the couch, drinking the nasty swill he called beer. Now he was slumped half off of his seat, his face planted firmly on the floor with a small puddle of drool around his lips. His baggy pants and shirt obeyed the laws of gravity to reveal his back and ass crack.\n\nIt would have been ridiculous. It would have been hilarious.\n\nIf he hadn't beaten the shit out of her last week.\n\nShe glanced at the wall, seeing that he had pushed a box over to hide the dent she'd made when he'd slammed her against it. The blood stains were probably still there\u2014she'd never once seen him clean anything.\n\nHer head whipped back to the monster on the floor. Her hand squeezed the knife. She wasn't good with her left hand. Her work would be sloppy. She wasn't too disappointed by this. What had he been thinking? Oh, yes, greed.... want.... anger that she'd denied him. Yes.... That was the real pain. The want.... he was addicted to it. No self-control, no empathy. Want Want! WANT!\n\nDid she want to make it slow.... or quick? Should she tie him up? Did she break his legs? Cut out his tongue? There were so many possibilities.\n\nShe carefully removed her clothes. She would make his brain boil with want and then she would devour his pain as he couldn't have it. She tied him up with her own shirt, her own bra. She stuffed her socks into his mouth. She left a single hand free. One hand that he would reach out with, one hand he would try to beat her down with.\n\nEvery time he would reach for her she would cut something off.\n\nHe'd given her a lot of pain.... she had come to give it back.",
        "The temple doors swung open, revealing a sight I hadn't anticipated.  In front of me, where I'd expected marble plinths, golden frescoes, and a proud display of the finest weapons forged by men and gods, was a chaotic mountain of unsorted weaponry. Every legendary sword, every fabled weapon, lay jumbled together in a bureaucrat's nightmare.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said, struggling to keep my voice level.  I turned to the Curator, who appeared older than the crumbling temple itself. \"Does the Great Hall always look like this?\"\n\nShe hesitated, a flicker of embarrassment in her eyes. \"Well, you see, we, err, we get so much coming in that I just don't know what to do with them all, and before I know it they just start...\"\n\n\"Piling up?\" I offered.\n\nA dry chuckle escaped her lips. \"Young man, every hero who's come here has faced the same predicament! If Samson could climb halfway up just to find a jawbone, I'm sure you'll do just fine.\"  With that, she turned and left me alone in the Great Hall, her footsteps echoing until only my own thoughts remained.\n\nI turned towards the towering pile of weapons. Following my training, I closed my eyes and focused on the task at hand.  The Curator had said each weapon possesses a voice, and though many may call out, only one would choose me, earning me the title of Hero.\n\nAs I stood there, waves of whispers filled the room.  \"Have the dragons returned? Take me and bring your people salvation.\" \"Is the Ragnar\u00f6k come? Now is your hour of need, and I am here to serve.\" \"The people crave a champion, and only I can deliver them one.\" \"The end days are coming, boy. You need me to drive the demons away.\"\n\nDozens of voices swirled around me, each claiming to be the sole key to my people's salvation.  Shivering, I squeezed my eyes shut, overwhelmed by the cacophony. How could I choose just one? I longed for a moment of silence to think.\n\nGradually, the voices faded, leaving the Great Hall quiet.  Hours passed, but still, I hadn't found my fated weapon. Had I failed to become a Hero?\n\nThen, a voice cut through the silence. \"Isn't that much better? I hate it when it gets too loud in here. No way to make myself heard.\"\n\nIt was *my own voice*, emanating from somewhere within the pile. A shiver ran down my spine. This was it.  This was the feeling of being chosen.\n\n\"Where are you?\" I asked, my voice cracking after the long silence. Darkness had fallen within the Great Hall.\n\n\"Around the other side of this heap, near the bottom,\" my own voice replied.  Suppressing the unsettling sensation of hearing myself speak, I carefully navigated the mountain of weapons, avoiding the sharp edges of spearheads and battle-axes.  As I reached the back, I spotted my fated weapon.",
        "Dr. Edmunds, a tremor of cautious optimism in his voice, Johannes announced, \"Something interesting came up on the latest screen.\"\n\nEdmunds, finally tearing her gaze from her monitor to Johannes, replied, \"This better be good. My grant proposal is due Friday.\"  He quickly glanced at the ground, concealing his surprise at her appearance.  Paler and more gaunt than usual, Edmunds looked unwell.  Johannes felt his face flush. Hardly anyone dared enter Edmunds's office without an appointment.  Luckily, his disheveled state\u2014greasy hair and a wrinkled biosafety suit\u2014seemed to warrant her full attention.  She must have been working double shifts, he thought.\n\n\"If this is what I think it is,\" Johannes began, \"you'll have every big pharma company knocking at *your* door. I repeated the experiment three times, in triplicate. The data is statistically significant at a *p*-value of 0.0001.  In other words, there's only a 0.01% chance this is due to random variation, and\u2014\"\n\n\"Let me see,\" Edmunds interrupted.\n\nJohannes handed her the data sheets.  Edmunds sat up straighter, leaning forward, her brow furrowed in inquisitive concern as she scanned the numbers.\n\nSample 1215: at long last, a positive hit.\n\nA rare smile slowly spread across Edmunds's face, blossoming into a wide grin.  Eyes shining, she said, \"We spent five years on the edge of this colony, hoping to find a new therapeutic compound to combat the cancer on Earth\u2026\"  Her hand fluttered to her chest, resting over her heart. A violent cough seized her, spasms racking her thin frame.  She covered her mouth with her other hand, and when she pulled it away, spots of blood stained her palm.  She hastily wiped her hand on a handkerchief, already dotted with similar stains. The familiar dull throb returned to her chest.\n\nJohannes offered her water, which she gratefully accepted. After a pause, she continued, \"We took a risk coming here. They said we wouldn't find anything near the mines. But that turned out to be our advantage. What was Sample 1215?\"\n\nJohannes, his initial caution replaced by excitement, explained, \"Sample 1215 was one of the few organic compounds found in the soil excavated from the mines. There's life down there, likely bacterial, producing this compound in significant quantities. Mass spectrometry revealed a unique peptide sequence, unlike anything on Earth, though there's some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins.\" He paused for breath \u2013 the lower oxygen content of the Mars facility always a factor.  \"When introduced to cancer cells *in vitro*, it killed almost all of them without harming non-cancerous cells.  In animal models, it appears to inhibit angiogenesis. So, in addition to its cancer-specific cytotoxicity, it prevents blood vessel growth to the tumor.\"\n\nEdmunds slowly rose, her smile unwavering.",

This inspiration can lead them to believe they, too, can be heroes, challenging the status quo. \n\nI hope this clarifies the message.",
        "A man stood in the middle of nothing, resembling a pen poised above a blank paper. After surveying his surroundings, pondering silently, and muttering a few words to himself, he began to speak.\n\nAs his words flowed, the void around him transformed into a vibrant scene, with characters materializing as if by magic. In no time, the space brimmed with life, intricate details, and excitement. Each utterance from the man's lips manifested into reality before him, with characters obediently enacting the actions he described and the scenery shifting in the blink of an eye.\n\nSuddenly, an *ahem* pierced through the narrative and disrupted the man\u2019s dialogue.\n\n\"Excuse me, but who are you?\" Another man, strikingly similar to the first, interjected.\n\n\"Wait, **who** are you?\"\n\n\"Isn't it obvious? I'm the Narrator. And look at the mess you've created!\"\n\n\"No, I'm the narrator. Not you. Have you hit your head?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't. I'm quite certain you've stumbled into the wrong story and are meddling with mine.\"\n\n\"This is my story, not yours. Please leave before causing further confusion and disrupting all my hard work.\"\n\nThe initial man glared at the second, almost daring him to challenge the statement. To his surprise, the second man not only spoke but also turned his words into reality around him. Shock quickly turned to anger as the initial man\u2019s efforts were now being undermined and discarded.\n\nGlowering at the interloper, the first man raised his voice, attempting to reclaim control by altering the story. Soon, both men were engaged in a fierce battle of words, each vying for dominance over the narrative, while the characters realized the futility of trying to follow the conflicting instructions.\n\nGrowing impatient, the characters demanded a resolution as they had other stories to participate in and needed their compensation.\n\n\"Come on, let's move on! We have other stories to be a part of!\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, just narrate the story!\"\n\n\"We don't have all day!\"\n\nIgnoring the pleas of the characters, the two men remained steadfast in their quest for supremacy, completely engrossed in wresting control over the story.\n\nMost of the characters gave up and departed for other tales, leaving behind a small group of four characters. One was injured but stable, while the other two needed just one more story before they could return home.\n\nDespite attempts by the injured character to intervene, the ongoing power struggle between the narrators caused the appearance of useful objects to flicker and vanish erratically, making it nearly impossible to grasp them securely.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, a loud popping sound shattered the silence, startling everyone.\n\n\"Hey, look! We can eliminate the narrators!\" exclaimed one of the characters.\n\nThe surviving narrator trembled in fear as he glanced at his deceased counterpart. Struggling to speak, he was met with a shocked reaction from the other characters, who observed the third character holding a gun and the gradual disappearance of the deceased narrator.\n\n\"Shall we proceed? We've wasted enough time!\" the characters urged.\n\nThe surviving narrator cleared his throat and began to speak, but was abruptly interrupted.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but are you certain you're in the correct story? I was under the impression that this story belonged to me.\"",

The others\u2014men in animal onesies\u2014were equally quiet. Robort, lacking a mouth and equipped only with a screen where it should have been, couldn't speak anyway. Jim, still in shock, said nothing. Only Kappa's occasional mutterings broke the silence.\n\nJim had lost track of time during their walk. The corridor was dimly lit, with Robort's lights and buttons providing most of the illumination. Earlier, when Jim had asked if Robort's hulking frame contained a flashlight, Man of Average Height had quickly silenced him. \"Nature always gives us the best of the best,\" he'd declared\u2014an ironic statement, Jim thought, considering they were inside a man-made complex.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, they reached a room at the corridor's end.

When most of the gathering looks like the cast from an old school RPG, the grandson with the accounting degree becomes the outlier.\n\nThings got stranger after the funeral, when the executor of the estate (who turned out to be some very powerful wizard from a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy) pulled me aside with what he deemed \"an urgent inheritance.\" I was intrigued to say the least. In his hotel room, I was informed of the large financial windfall coming my way.\n\nBut there was a catch. I now had the responsibility to tend to my grandfather's pet: a small dragon. Had it not been for his tail and long neck, he'd have been no bigger than a toy poodle. The executor/wizard explained to me that he was a dwarf species, and that the Andromeda Galaxy is swarming with very large dragons. He offered to show me around. I politely declined.\n\nMy grandfather named the dragon Drexel. Apparently, they were tight. During our trip home, from my grandfather's final resting place in upstate New York, to where I lived in northern California (for obvious reasons, we drove), Drexel was flat depressed. It took a couple of days for him to acknowledge my presence, or even eat. We were halfway back to California on I-80 before he even showed interest in food.",

Looking across our dorm room, I saw my suite-mate Sam\u2014except instead of the tall, red-haired guy I knew, there was a short, red-haired dwarf. My screams woke him, and he came over, trying to convince me I was crazy. According to him, he'd always been a dwarf.\n\nNeeding to clear my head, I stumbled across the mess hall in the early morning to find my other friend Mark. When I knocked on his door, a massive Orc came bounding out, bleary-eyed. I tried to run, but the creature grabbed my shoulders and spun me around, demanding to know why I was screaming. Like Sam, he insisted he'd always been an Orc.\n\nBoth of them decided I needed medical attention and led me to the healer at the end of the hall. I agreed, hoping someone could confirm I wasn't losing my mind. But when we entered the cold wooden room, I faced yet another shock\u2014the healer was an elf. After my inevitable freakout, she too claimed she'd always been an elf.\n\nShe suggested a routine health check, including a prostate exam. Despite my protests, Mark and Sam backed her up. Finally giving in, I climbed onto the cold table. But when she reached into her drawer, instead of medical equipment, she pulled out an enormous, bright red\u2014\n\n\"STOP. Just stop.\" I slammed my hands on the table. \"This game isn't fucking fun anymore. We were supposed to be a group of humans searching for the power amulet. Now it's just a cluster fuck of people with high-level disguise and buffing powers, trying to convince me I'm crazy and get me butt fucked. Fuck you guys.\"\n\n\"Whoa, calm down, we're just messing around and having a bit of fun,\" Sam chuckled.\n\nMark grinned. \"Ya, I thought it was pretty damn funny myself. You should've seen how angry you got when I rolled that 3rd nat 20 in a row for the bluff check. Fucking clutch.\"\n\n\"That was bullshit and you know it. You only got it because the DM let you reroll.\" I stood up, gathering my things. \"If you're going to be fucking trolls, I quit.

Through the mirror, he knew there were people watching him\u2014dangerous people. He was like them now, worse maybe. The chair creaked as he peered at the glass.\n\nThey knew he knew.\n\nA door slammed into the wall as a large man entered, turning carefully to close it. It locked with a heavy click, followed by the sound of a sliding bolt. The boy could tell, somehow.\n\nThe man sat down across from him with a calm, penetrating stare\u2014the sort that could see deep into a person, figure out everything there was to know. The boy stared back. He could do that too, now.\n\n\"You comfortable? Need some coffee, something to eat?\" The man straightened his uniform. \"I can send someone to get it for you, if you want anything.\"\n\n\"No.\" The boy didn't want to talk.\n\n\"Listen, I was like you once. You're not the first to end up in a situation like this.\" The man motioned towards the mirror and the camera in the corner.\n\nThe boy could tell the camera was turned off. Those behind the glass had left.\n\n\"I'm going to tell you a story, kid. It's not particularly long, but it's the truth. I think you'll be able to tell that now\u2014the truth, I mean.\" He met the boy's eyes, waiting for recognition.\n\nShuffling his cuffs, the boy nodded slowly. The man began in a heavy tone.\n\n\"When I was younger, I had to kill two people in my home, on a cold night in October. It was dark and raining, the wind howling.\" He paused. \"It wasn't something I had planned on doing.

        "Night had fallen on the snowy tundra, and with it, the warmth and safety of day became a distant memory. The cold was bitter, and he had traveled far. Exhausted, he looked on, and in the distance, saw his destination\u2014a deep red glow piercing the blackness like a forge burning bright in a long-forgotten factory.\n\nIt wasn't far now, but these last few steps would be the most grueling. Through the snow, breathless and broken, under a starless sky, he made his way toward the light.\n\nAs he drew nearer, his eyes widened, enraptured by what now stood before him: a temple of sorts, etched into the rock face, bold yet humble in its magnificence.  In front stood a man, proud and stern, as if carved from the mountain itself; his shadow, like a rearing bear, danced tall on the wall behind him, animated by the light of a dying fire.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d the guard said, emotionless.\n\nStartled by the man's keen eyesight, having thought himself hidden, he promptly composed himself. \u201cI seek answers,\u201d he murmured from the shadows.\n\n\u201cYou will find none here. Leave now and forget this place, or here you will remain until your lungs draw their last.\u201d\n\nAs if both deaf and blind, he stumbled forward, heedless of the guard\u2019s warnings, taking his first tired steps toward the heat of the fire.\n\nWhat emerged from the darkness was a man admonished *of* humanity.

        "\"You weren't supposed to kill him!\"\n\nI knew this meeting was doomed from the start. But delaying the inevitable was pointless. I went in, guns blazing.\n\n\"How were we supposed to know everyone gets their own messiah? So we *maybe* killed ours.  I bet everyone else has, too! He arrived in a violent period, in an occupied country, and stirred up trouble with the political and religious leaders. It was two thousand years ago! How are we accountable for *their* actions?\n\nWhat did I do to deserve this? I was born 2,109 years later.  All he'd have to do now is reach a terminal and perform a miracle. He'd be on a fusion-jet to the Core Planet within the hour, perform another miracle, and the leaders of all twenty-nine planets would be on his side.\n\nHe couldn't do that then. In thirty-three years, he convinced a few thousand people out of millions. Today, he could have reached millions in seconds. Jesus didn't even know about China, or the Southern Hemisphere! You dropped a convict into a technologically advanced civilization with no plan, basic psychic tech, and expected him to convince the world? If we executed him, it's your organization's fault.\"\n\nI stood, panting, having just unleashed that verbal tirade. I mentally kicked myself. I'd committed the holy equivalent of punching Jesus in the face, followed by a kick in the groin\u2014repeatedly.  He probably lost a tooth, too.\n\nThe hovering priest delivered his verdict. \"I'm giving you another one.

Even looming exams pale in comparison to this emotional rollercoaster. There's nothing quite like riding the wave of having feelings for someone. Will senpai notice me? That's more of a joke than anything because we're already best friends.\n\nI can hear what you're thinking: \"Ah, the dreaded friend zone.\" But it's not what you might expect. You see, I placed myself there deliberately, knowing it was the only path to her heart. She's different from other girls\u2014and before you roll your eyes at that clich\u00e9, let me explain. She's hesitant around guys. \"Hesitant\" might not be the right word, and honestly, I can only guess at what's going on in her mind.\n\nShe used to embrace solitude, claiming she didn't want to date anyone. But that's changed. Now she tells me about boys she finds attractive: \"He looked like he came down from heaven,\" she'll say. Being one of her few close friends\u2014and male at that\u2014I'm privy to conversations most guys would rather avoid. But I consider it an acceptable trade-off.\n\nThe complications arise from her shyness\u2014she'd never make the first move. I'm similarly reserved, so I can't fault her for that. She's also adamant about not dating within our friend group, having witnessed how a recent breakup fractured our social circle over the summer.\n\nHere's where I might seem unusual: physical intimacy isn't my primary concern. Perhaps that makes me different from \"other guys,\" though that feels like another clich\u00e9. While I cherish the idea of cuddling and kissing, the more intimate aspects don't preoccupy my thoughts. I suspect she shares similar sentiments.\n\nThe plot thickens: I've already confessed\u2014sort of. When she figured out my feelings over the summer, things became awkward. I messaged her (yes, I know that was cowardly) expressing my feelings while emphasizing our friendship's importance. She wanted to remain friends and apologized for the awkwardness.",
        "Jane's pulse quickened. The magnificent man sitting before her, typing on his qPad, was *the one*. She knew it. Wedding bells chimed in her mind as she stared, practically mesmerized.  This was crazy. This was a mixed-blood-type bar\u2014a place for cheap drinks, not romance. Fornication wasn't just frowned upon; it was a death sentence.  Police would shoot you on sight, then execute your family, friends, acquaintances, even pets. Summary execution by the thought police.\n\n*We're not meant to be together.*\n\nThe thought pulsed in her mind, each repetition more resonant, sending pangs of regret and sorrow radiating outward.  Where did emotions go after you felt them?  Her priest told her she hadn't achieved the appropriate thetan levels or donated enough to the church to know.\n\nLove at first sight. She'd never believed in it, until now. All her preconceived notions shattered.  Even *thinking* about this Fabio/Arnold hybrid was instant death.\n\nAnd yet\u2026\n\n*I can't help it.*\n\nLove knows no boundaries. An ephemeral entity transcending space-time, spelling, grammar, intelligence, wealth, race, and gender.  The great divider and the great uniter. The source of our greatness and our greatest downfall.\n\nJane had enough of society. Of rules. Of the systematically brutal Orwellian dictatorship that had chosen blood type as the ultimate divider in an unjustly patriarchal society overflowing with material wealth. But what was wealth without love?  Better to die with love on your lips than live an eternity in anonymity, never knowing true feeling.\n\n*Fuck it.*\n\nShe walked towards him, the corded muscles in his forearms dancing as he typed vehemently. He stopped abruptly. Halfway across the room, their eyes met. His piercing blue sapphires gazed deeper into her soul than she'd ever imagined possible. She closed the distance.\n\n\"...Hi,\" she said. He continued to stare. \"I don't know how to put this other than I am yours and you are mine.\"  Her life had never felt more complete. She could die happy now.\n\n\"What?\" he said, visibly taken aback.\n\n\"We have to go! The O-Cops will be here soon, but we can escape to the Eastern Ridgebacks and seek the Temple of Quel'Thloth. They'll harbor and sanctify our love.\"\n\n\"Oh, fuck, please don't do this. Stop.\"",

He shifted, trying to get closer to the ground without touching the mirey soil. \n\n\"I'm not sure,\" I admitted. \"But we weren't told to expect anyone.\" I strained my neck, trying to glimpse between the wavering plants to see any sign of them. \n\n\"I need to go closer,\" I said. \"Stay here.\" Isaac began to protest, but I motioned him to be quiet. \"You'll be safer here,\" I said, as I swam deeper into the crop. \n\nMy boots squelched quietly as I made my slow and cautious journey towards the landing site. Now and then, I heard their rough yelling and wondered if they had finally spotted my path through the field. There was no gunfire, and nobody appeared in my vision.

The spine was crisp and without wear, in odd contrast to the rest of the book's binding - the covers were scuffed and dusty, the corners bent and worn. The pages were odd as well; from the beginning, they were old and worn, yellowed like any timeless classic. As they progressed, they got lighter and lighter, the end looking almost brand new and quite crisp to boot.\n\nI opened it to a random page about a quarter of the way through, my thumb choosing a line somewhere in the middle:\n\n*The young man sat in the waiting area, nerves shot and stomach aflutter.

One night, his life took a dramatic turn. He was abducted, not by earthly beings, but by the gods of rock.  While he\u2019d dabbled in music, listening to the Beatles and other popular artists, it was merely a pastime. This night changed everything.\n\nFollowing his otherworldly encounter, David moved from city to city, his focus shifting from observant Jewish tradition to the heavy riffs of rock and roll. He rebelled against conformity, seeking his own definition of \"normal.\"  He formed bands in various cities, including Los Angeles and Milwaukee, prioritizing his newfound religion of rock over everything else, much to the chagrin of his parents.  But David was driven by a force beyond their understanding, a mission bestowed upon him by the rock gods.  As the 80s faded, so did his childhood idols. A new era dawned \u2013 the age of heavy metal.  The first time David heard Metallica, the sheer power and beauty of the music sent shivers down his spine. The symphony of vocals, guitar, bass, and drums captivated him completely.\n\nThe following decade saw the rise of bands like Nirvana, Sublime, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, further fueling David\u2019s passion.  In 1996, fate intervened. A struggling band called Disturbed parted ways with their lead singer, and David answered the call.  He was nearing the summit of Rock Olympus, and the gods, who had patiently watched his ascent, bestowed upon him their final gift.\n\nA strange ailment began to plague David.  He felt an unknown force building within him, an energy he couldn\u2019t control.  It worsened with each passing day, defying any medical explanation.  Music, his usual solace, offered no comfort.  Melodies became distorted, chords refused to resolve. Only a few specific patterns resonated, hinting at a deeper meaning. David realized this was a test from the rock gods.  After months of struggle, the pressure became unbearable.  \"After constant struggle, months of battling it, he could no longer contain it. It was itching to break out, to explode into the world.\"",

It touched my forehead, the surface cold against my skin, the connection to my mind immediate.  The bearded man appeared, his neck emblazoned with the familiar snake tattoo that mirrored my own. I squeezed my eyes shut, humming, trying to block him out, but the words still slipped through, insidious drips and drabs: \"Remember.... You are.... The Corsair....

The beach had been nicer, the warm sand between my toes a stark contrast to this biting cold.  I couldn't remember the transition, how one had become the other.\n\nThe memory of the beach flowed back: I\u2019d taken off my shoes, enjoying the warmth.  Houses in the distance, but a feeling pulled me in the opposite direction.  Further along the beach, I saw them: large, muscled men, their faces angry, loading heavy bags of white powder onto a boat. I\u2019d waved, wanting to help, but never reached them. Dunes rose and fell, and suddenly, the beach was gone, replaced by the endless expanse of the desert.  A shame.  They might have helped.\n\nA soft idea began to bloom, unfurling like a flower \u2013 like the one I saw the last time I\u2019d tried to get a haircut, only this time, no giant wasps. Not in my head. I walked, intentionally away from home, for hours, until thirst drove me to a market stall on a busy road.  I bartered for fruit juice, wandered through dusty pyramids and damp, empty temples, even through a round office filled with shouting men.

During the military's bombardment of our facility, a terrified cleaning lady, fleeing from some rather amorous fox-people, opened the worst door of all: G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, better known internally as Ragnar\u00f6k Expanded.\n\nThis military training simulation combined every apocalyptic mythology: Norse Ragnar\u00f6k, the Olympian-Titan War, Aztec end-times, Christian Revelation, and Hindu destruction\u2014with Nyarlathotep riding atop Shrek as an easter egg. It was designed to break the toughest soldiers; only ten test subjects had emerged sane.\n\nThe world crumbled. Fenris devoured the sun while Quetzalcoatl incinerated the Eastern Seaboard. Zeus and Thor's battle leveled Western Europe. Kali and her undead army decimated India. Japan vanished into mist, from which survivors occasionally emerge, babbling about hatters and terrible fires. North Korea fell to Famine, who had long dwelled among them. California... well, we don't speak of California anymore.\n\nI write this from New Zealand's mountains, where I live as a shepherd\u2014perhaps the last surviving employee of Writing Prompts Inc.

        "Here's a restructured version of your story with improved flow and coherence:\n\n# The Body Swap\n\nEleven years ago, I swapped consciousness with my little cousin, Albert. What started as a simple agreement - he would enjoy a freshman year of high school as me, Chris, while I would take a history test for him in seventh grade - turned into something far more complex.\n\n## The Initial Swap\n\n\"How? What the-\" I exclaimed, my voice unusually high.\n\n\"I know it feels weird,\" my cousin Chris explained, \"but I promise you'll get used to this.\" He then launched into an outlandish story about being an ancient Chinese emperor, only to laugh it off as a prank. The truth, he revealed, was about a strange book he'd found in his garden.\n\n\"Yes, actually the book sort of *glows* when I look at it,\" Chris said nervously. \"It was what made me want to look through it in the first place. Take a look.\" He walked awkwardly to his backpack - perhaps still adjusting to my body - and produced a dusty book.\n\nWhen I touched it, everything went black.\n\n## The Aftermath\n\nI awoke back in my body, completely fatigued and immobile. Chris appeared, noting my symptoms: \"Extreme fatigue, bloody nose... and by the looks of it, a concussion.\" After chanting some words in an unusually deep voice, he commanded me to stand. Mysteriously, my symptoms vanished.\n\nChris explained that the book contained spells that only worked with his eyes and soul. Any attempt by others would reverse the effects - exactly what had happened to me.\n\n## The Real Purpose\n\nChris's true motives emerged: he needed me to take his history test and ask out a girl named Ashley. When I protested, he offered a deal - he'd owe me a favor in return. I accepted, knowing such a debt might prove useful later.\n\n## The Second Swap\n\nBack in Chris's body, I decided to explore while my original body lay unconscious.",
        "The treaty, finally ratified after arduous negotiation, marked a turning point. Earth's ambassador prepared to deliver a speech that would reshape human and galactic history.  Thirty-some alien species, comprising the Galactic Republic, had approved Earth's membership by a vote of 274 to 66 in their Parliament. The condition: the complete eradication of music from human existence. In return, humanity gained access to advanced technology through trade, ten seats in Parliament, and virtual immunity from military threat.\n\nReaching this point had taken fourteen months. Silencing independent artists had been relatively easy. Web hosts blocked music streaming services and aggressively scanned for audio files.  However, mainstream musicians fiercely resisted the clumsily named Initiative for Intergalactic Peace and Quiet\u2014the UN\u2019s campaign to eliminate music. Records were destroyed, CDs melted, and personal music players crushed.  The campaign escalated dramatically: recalcitrant record executives were jettisoned into the sun, teen idols\u2019 vocal cords severed, and Justin Bieber himself incinerated by the President on live television. Nickelback\u2019s final concert, a smash hit, took place within the Large Hadron Collider. These extreme measures, however regrettable, were deemed necessary for human survival. The Republic possessed weapons of unimaginable power, and their hatred of music was absolute.\n\nDespite the existential threat, humanity was deeply reluctant to sacrifice a vital part of its culture. Secret plans were hatched. Backroom deals were struck, clandestine networks activated, and elaborate traps laid.  Meanwhile, Earth's scientists worked covertly to understand the aliens' profound aversion to music.  Theories emerged regarding biochemical and behavioral impacts on certain species, but the exact reasons remained elusive. Did music control them, or did it erode their self-control? Was it an existential threat to their regime, or an addictive substance?\n\nThe War on Music remained a mystery. Humanity\u2019s gamble rested on the belief that the Republic would fracture if enough of its citizens were exposed to music. What better moment than the eve of their apparent victory, when they would all be watching the induction ceremony? The plan came together at the last possible second, as the ambassador approached the microphone.  The world, indeed the galaxy, held its breath, anticipating humanity's peaceful entry into the Galactic Republic. The speakers crackled, the teleprompter scrolled, and the ambassador began:\n\n> **\"Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you...\"**",
        "When people ask me what I like most about my job, I always reply, \"The sound.\" This invariably draws puzzled looks, but that's what I expect. After all, who would associate sounds with an art gallery?\n\nThis is my unique gift, one reason why I excel at my job and why I'm so passionate about it. I am particularly fond of abstract paintings\u2014vibrant, ranging from serene to wild, with endless possibilities. I could listen to a good painting for hours. Yes, listen. I hear colors. Brown resonates with a deep timbre, orange emits a high, piercing sound, and pink plays like a set of soft strings.\n\nWhen I focus on a painting, I hear nothing else. The melody of the image fills my senses. I ask, \"Where would you like your painting, and what kind of music do you enjoy?\" This question often surprises my clients, but I can find the perfect painting for them, precisely because I can see, I can hear, and I love what I do, a little more every day. \n\nSo, when should I schedule an appointment for you?",

        "Susan always had a way with words.  She could give a semicolon a personality; she was *that* good.  She helped me navigate school and taught me how to write (hopefully, it worked).  Her skill wasn't just about crafting beautiful sentences; it was about manipulating the truth. She could tell you something unpleasant in such a way that you wouldn't realize what she truly meant. For example, when she hadn't done her homework, she\u2019d sheepishly tell the teacher she hadn't \"figured out\" the problem \u2013 not that she *couldn't*, but simply that she *hadn't*.  When people asked her opinion on their clothes, she'd either be brutally honest or deflect with compliments about individual features. That girl was amazing.\n\nMy arms and legs were riddled with scars, testaments to a life less carefully navigated, but her ebony skin had always been pristine.  It became a point of fascination \u2013 a symbol of health to some, a source of worry for others \u2013 especially after Susan and I lost touch.  During those years, whispers reached me.  Susan wasn't doing well, but she wouldn't reveal what was wrong, weaseling her way out of every conversation with her characteristic tongue-twisting. No one could figure out the truth.\n\nI saw her again at a New Year's Eve party.  I spotted her familiar black hair through the crowd, but when I approached, her appearance shocked me.  Her ebony skin had grayed, her hair was thinner, and even her once manicured nails were scraggly and unpolished.\n\n\"Susan, what's wrong?\" I asked.\n\nShe smiled wide. \"Why, Martel, whatever would suggest that I am not alright?\"\n\n\"Well, your appearance,\" I replied.\n\nShe sighed and looked back at me. \"Don't worry, hon, I'll live.\"\n\nIn that instant, the carefully constructed facade crumbled.  A look of horror spread across her face, drawing my attention to a horrific scar that slashed across her back, a deep, crinkled, and sore-looking hollow stretching from her back to her collarbone.\n\n\"I have to leave!\" she shouted, bolting from the room, her close friends in pursuit.\n\nThe next day, I learned the devastating news. Susan had taken her own life that night.",

I lay in the dark, scrolling through Reddit one last time, hoping someone figured it out. But there are no new comments. I am alone, and I have decided to escape the only way I can. I turn my music on, lay in my bed, and reach for the pills. I put as many as I can swallow in my mouth and take a drink. I repeat this process three more times, and then I wait.\n\nLaying there, feeling the pills drain my life, I suddenly hear a noise. Struggling, I lift my head, and a face swims into view in front of me. I gasp, my eyes widen, and it's harder to stay awake, but I fight with all my strength. More faces come into view, and I can hear them now. \"Where did she get the pills, dammit?\" \"I don't know, she has been acting out for days, clawing the windows and doors, screaming, and crying out.\" \"Well, go get the doctor now!\"\n\nI feel myself beginning to slip away as my mind tries to grasp what is happening.

So, lads, are you going to let a fighter brag about never satisfying his desires defeat us?!\"\n\nThe cries of the unwashed, uncivilized Northerners did not faze her Unsullied, the mightiest of her warriors, but some of the freemen from Volantis and Qarth who had joined her ranks seemed uneasy, and even a few sellswords appeared to question their payment.\n\n\"Enough of this.

        "Aaron's legs were numb.  The leather-bound swivel chair, his eight-hour-a-day prison, groaned beneath him, and the computer screen assaulted his already dry eyes.  It was 3:28\u2014for the last hour and a half, his pupils had been mirroring the sweep of the second hand on his watch. All day, the sounds of clicking mice, ringing phones, and clacking keyboards had played like a maddening, inescapable radio. His eyes traced another lap around the clock face before briefly closing. What better time for coffee than 3:30?\n\nHe stood, letting his chair exhale as blood rushed back into his legs. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, his gaze cleared the cubicle walls, taking in the entire office, all seventeen workers, his boss included. Same people. Same spots. Every single day.\n\nMug of scalding, over-brewed coffee in one hand, napkin anticipating the inevitable spill in the other, he took the thirty-eight steps from the break room back to his five-by-five cubicle.  A flimsy-walled fortress offering zero privacy that he, pathetically, considered his second home.  As he settled back in, the chair groaned again, and his legs began to lose feeling. Wincing at the first, burning sip of coffee, he licked his lips and reached to set the mug down beside his keyboard, when he noticed a slip of paper.\n\nLip still stinging, he cautiously picked up the sheet. Glancing over his shoulder, he began to read:\n\n> Dearest Worker,\n\n> How cowardly of me to leave a note instead of offering a handshake. My apologies.

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n\"Huh, always figured someone was watching me,\" Alex said upon discovering he was one of the main characters of *Perugini Paradise*, a TV show following him and his family members (Perugini being his last name). \"I knew my life had to be interesting enough to make a TV show.\" Scrolling through the Alternate Universe's internet, he found there were just as many fan fictions about his show as Harry Potter had in his own universe. Among the different titles, he found one worth reading: \"Pokemon Yo.\"\n\n\"You guys wanna walk to the breachway?\" Alex's cousin Mike asked, looking up from his phone on the Rhode Island beach. It was that time of year when the Peruginis took their annual family vacation to the beach during July.\n\n\"I'm down,\" said Chris, Alex's other cousin. \"I need to hatch some of my Pokemon eggs.\" Reaching into his pokepocket, Chris pulled out three small eggs in glass incubators.\n\n\"Roberto, hand me some of those Pokeballs,\" Nick, Alex's older brother, called to his other cousin.\n\n\"Sure thing.\" Roberto reached into one of the bags between himself and his sister Lea to grab a handful of Pokeballs.\n\n\"Yo, it's lit,\" said Matteo, Alex's youngest brother, as Roberto tossed some balls to him and Nick. Walking past their dad and his friend Dan playing Kan Jam, they began their journey down the beach to catch 'em all.\n\n\"It's not Staryu, it's Starme,\" Nick joked as a group of Starmes washed up on the beach.\n\n\"Pokedex says they're around 400 CP, better use some Razz Berries,\" Alex said, throwing down some Razz Berries for the Starmes to feed on.",

Their actions seemed involuntary\u2014a collective decision to save what society might deem a fallen angel. A select few still felt the need to be heroes, rising above the rest in the mire. Perhaps life held some sentimental value for them, or maybe charity was just an ego boost. In the end, it didn't matter. The uncertain appeals to hope and calls to Christ soon stopped when they realized they were falling on deaf ears. Misguided attempts began anew, only to be drowned out by the random snippets of conversation from other passersby.\n\n\"JESUS! JUST FUCKING JUMP ALREADY IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN?\" screamed an increasingly annoyed man who, just minutes ago, had been sharing his own loud version of the gospel.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed, reflected in the faces of the gathering crowd. \n\nAs time passed, the man's leather jacket became his only friend, shielding him from the howling wind threatening his composure. He cleared his throat, a stark contrast to the uneasy silence, and averted his eyes upward to the cloudy, gray sky. Yet somehow, they still delighted in the nonexistent rays, which burned images and geometric patterns into his retinas. \n\n\"He said to them: Go!\" \n\nBottles of blueberry vodka and iPhones were dropped for the first time as the crowd rushed toward the water, each person making a point of not getting too close to the man. The water soon turned red, and he laughed as he walked back onto the bridge. Once the deed was done, he trudged along the middle of the road, knowing no vehicle could harm him. Occasionally, he slowed his pace to scoff at the survivors, their maimed bodies wrapped around railings\u2014a clear sign of their desperate attempt to escape the \"mind control.\"\n\n\"Please... please...\" the words trailed off and then rebounded, \"please...\"\n\nThe plea was cut off, but he was sure it ended with \"kill me.\" That cry echoed from every direction, inevitably dying out after some time.

Everything does, but you never think about it like that.\n\nThere's a trick, though. There often is, once you've done something enough times. The trick with a hacksaw is to use a blade designed for metal. The smaller teeth, while slower, keep a truer path and don't diverge as much as a wood blade's larger teeth.  It goes slower, of course, but if you're rushing this step, you've already lost.\n\nThat was the key: take your time. Make all the pieces small enough to fit into the beetle containers.

Her sister, Katie, checked her phone again.\n\n\"Yeah, I'll tell Mom and Dad you died. See ya,\" Katie said, placing a hand on Donna's charred arm before turning to leave.  Donna\u2019s death had become a serious inconvenience.  Katie had been summoned at least five times this year to identify the body or speak to Donna one last time.  The requests were always the same: water the plants, feed the cat, and meet for coffee later.  It was hard for Katie to suppress an eye roll. Donna had fallen asleep with a cigarette again and set herself on fire.\n\nOn her way home from the body collection point, Katie passed Ed the Jumper. Every last Saturday of the month, at approximately 6:00 PM, Ed jumped from the highest bridge in town, landing face-first on the concrete below.  Katie had once asked him why. He\u2019d explained that it was simply his time to be dead, like the old days, when death was permanent. So, he kept himself dead as much as possible by immediately killing himself upon revival. Over the years, Katie had noticed that while Ed's body repaired itself and appeared functional, he\u2019d become paler and more obsessed with maintaining his state of death.  Perhaps constant death was detrimental to his mental state. But Katie didn't dwell on it; Ed would be dead again in two minutes anyway.\n\nKatie almost made it home before remembering Donna's cat.  Those creatures, unlike humans, still died permanently if neglected.  With a sigh, she turned down an alley beside her house.\n\n\"To die or not to die! This is your choice!\" a man shouted from a street corner, waving flyers. He thrust one into Katie's hands before she could react and hurried down the street, pursuing a group of unsuspecting pedestrians with his pamphlets. Katie recognized the type: a \"Cryo-napper,\" slang for someone who cryogenically froze themselves, hoping death would be permanent again upon their eventual thawing.  Katie tossed the flyer.  She doubted anyone was working on a cure for their semi-permanent state. Why would they? Death, the ultimate disease, had been cured. There was no undoing it, only living with it.\n\nReaching Donna's apartment, Katie texted her parents: \"Donna died again. I plan to as well. Check on cat and plant for D.

        "It was much easier than Joe had originally thought. He reflected on how he had simply offered the woman a drink, laced with Rohypnol, of course, and then moved her limp, unconscious body into his truck. He was driving to his private residence, deep in the sparsely populated backwoods of his town, where no one would disturb him.\n\nIn a way, Joe didn't want to do this, but he couldn't stop fantasizing about the time he would spend with his new guest. In his lonely isolation, Joe had lost touch with the world. He could never seem to socialize properly to get women to like him. With his increasing age and worsening appearance, Joe felt he could not afford to wait any longer. He had convinced himself that if they could just spend a little more time with him, one might eventually fall in love with him. So he devised a plan: he would kidnap women he liked and force them to stay with him. If they wanted out, if they couldn't eventually like him back, well, he obviously couldn't let them go to the police... could he? In any case, Joe hoped it wouldn't come to that. The lonely truck turned onto the dirt path that would eventually lead to his home, unaware that it was not as empty as he thought.\n\nJoe entered his residence. It was thoroughly cleaned in preparation for his \"guest.\" He had to make a good first impression, after all. He laid the woman\u2014no, his female acquaintance\u2014on the couch and went to work tying her hands and feet. Joe wouldn't take the chance of his guest running away before he could properly introduce himself.\n\n\"Hey Joe,\" a voice said in a calm and even tone, startling Joe nevertheless. Turning around, he saw an old but fit, bearded man sitting at his kitchen table. Frozen in shock, he just stared at the old man. Someone caught me? Already!? But I was careful! Do I kill him? Who else knows? Am I going to prison? Those were the thoughts that fired around in his brain. His body screamed for action, but his mind didn't know what to do.\n\n\"Listen to me very carefully,\" the old man said, again in a steady tone. Without an idea of what to do, Joe did just what the man said. \"I am you, from the future.\" The old man had a stern look in his eye. \"And what you are doing will never work.\" The old man began telling Joe, in detail, all the things he did and would do. Joe had told no one of his desires, yet this old man knew every part of it.\n\nUpon hearing what the old man had to say, Joe realized that the old man was telling the truth. He saw himself, older yes, but strikingly similar in appearance. Joe couldn't say anything; he was dumbfounded. Stressed by the abnormality of the situation, Joe broke down.\n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" Joe whimpered, tears rolling down his face. He was caught, and by his future self no less. The old man stood up and made his way toward his sobbing younger self. With an empathetic pat on the shoulder, the old man handed Joe a card.\n\n\"This was the place I went to when I realized what I'd been doing. They're probably just starting out now, but they really helped me see the wrong I had been doing.\" The old man had a solemn look on his face now. \"It was too late for the people I had hurt, but you still have a chance to make things right.\"\n\n\"What about her?\" Joe asked, motioning to the woman on his couch.\n\n\"I'll take her back.",

And I\u2019m afraid you're mistaken, kid. This is Hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?? You mean my religion wasn't the right answer? No, no, I\u2014I need to speak to the Devil immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cHahaha, kid, you don\u2019t know where you are. You can\u2019t just go talk to the Head Honcho, the big cheese, the Heatmeister himself. You\u2014hey, where\u2019re you going?\u201d\n\nI\u2019d had enough of that guy. I dealt with suck-ups like him on Earth and wasn't about to put up with it here. I headed for the directory to find the Devil\u2019s room number. Sixth floor, room sixty-six. Of course. I climbed the stairs to the sixth floor\u2014the elevator appeared to be out of service for years\u2014and found the Devil\u2019s room. Nervously, I knocked on the door.",
        "Here's the polished version, maintaining the humorous tone while improving flow and readability:\n\n# The Last Fare\n\nI'm at my wit's end.\n\nEvery time\u2014and I mean *every single time*\u2014I get into this car, something absurd happens. I'm just an honest man trying to make a living, yet somehow my taxi has become a magnet for every hard-boiled detective, fugitive space warrior, and mobster-with-a-heart-of-gold in existence.\n\nThere I'll be, waiting for a normal fare\u2014perhaps a sweet elderly lady heading to the shops, or a couple bound for the airport on their romantic getaway. But no. Instead, I get secret agents clutching armored briefcases and plucky reporters with \"complicated\" relationships with superheroes.\n\nIt's always \"follow that car!\" and \"step on it!\"\u2014and then we're off on another preposterous chase.\n\nIn just the past three weeks, I've crashed through fourteen large barns (emerging each time in a cloud of startled chickens), jumped across eight missing bridge sections, and been punched six times by a masked ninja standing on my hood. My doctor says my nose will never quite be the same.\n\nMy blood pressure can't take much more of this. Each day brings another high-speed chase through downtown Tokyo or Megacity Prime. I live in Bradford, mind you\u2014yet somehow we'll round a corner and suddenly be zooming through some high-tech hellscape in a hover car.\n\nAnd it's never somewhere peaceful. The most serene location so far was a mountain road\u2014Swiss Alps, I think. Beautiful scenery. But within two minutes, I was dodging rockets and charging full-tilt at a Nazi helicopter. The square-jawed fellow in the cowboy hat wasn't helping matters, shouting at me to \"hold her steady\" while he lobbed grenades and flirted with some Russian woman.\n\nI'm still alive, somehow. I've been shot at, stabbed, and set on fire by a terminator. Pre-cognitive cops shot out one of my tires, leaving me with whiplash\u2014which will never heal if I keep ending up in a hansom cab chasing the Gang of Four.\n\nThey say you need nerves of steel for this job. I've been trying to develop them, but it's rather difficult when you're constantly terrified. Just when I thought I was getting a handle on things, it was all \"Red Leader, standing by,\" and suddenly I'm hurtling toward something that was definitely not a moon in a giant letter X. The droid in the back's incessant beeping did nothing for my concentration.\n\nThe pay isn't even worth it. Every fare ends with a handful of money and a gravelly \"keep the change.\" Half the time it's not even legal tender\u2014just Imperial credits, florins, or conflict diamonds. What am I supposed to do with those? And even when it is real currency, it barely covers the journey, fuel (have you priced starship fuel lately?), and cleaning fees. Try getting pterodactyl blood out of a grille without professional help.\n\nIt seemed like such a bargain at the time. \u00a3300 for a car in good working order, one careful owner, all modern conveniences included. Nobody mentioned it would catapult me across time and space to be shot at by aliens and savage tribesmen. Or that I'd never get to enjoy the digital radio and self-cleaning windscreen because the thing keeps transforming into a wicker chariot or a U-boat.\n\nI'd love to sell it, truly. But every attempt to drive to the dealership ends with someone flinging open a back door, and off we go again. I've tried refusing fares, but they won't listen. The last one just laughed and kept calling me \"Chaz.\"\n\nI tell you what, I'm never buying a stuntman's car again.\n\n---\n\n*More stories available at [Inconsistent Pacing](https://inconsistentpacing.wordpress.com/fiction)*",
        "Here's the restructured text with improved flow and coherence:\n\n```markdown\nI never know who it's going to be until it happens. Today it's a woman, fairly short, dragging her son through the crowded mall on a Sunday afternoon while carrying a crying little girl. I can tell she's having a bad day, the little monsters are trying her patience in the worst way right now.\n\n*Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too.*\n\nI nonchalantly walk up behind her. She's pretty attractive but for her poorly behaved children. I notice the change come over her as I get near, she has a slight smile, and she's humming along now. Even her kids have taken her cue and have settled a little.\n\n*Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.*\n\n*Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling \"Yoo-Hoo!\"*\n\n\"Mommy, why are you humming a Christmas song,\" her little girl asked. \"It's June!\"\n\n\"You know sweetie, I have no idea.\"",
        "For the past week, I've been staring at my phone and wishing it would make some kind of noise. A text, phone call, I'd even take one of those damn annoying Amber Alert messages. I can't stand the silence, I can't stand being in the dark. Your pictures still haunt me on Facebook. Your smile, the little dimple on your left cheek that only showed up when you were truly happy. I lived for that dimple. It's strange, we complain about people putting too many photos online, but that changes when the person is gone. Now, I am asking myself why we didn't take more pictures together, why we didn't ever follow through on our plans. We were all talk. \n\nAnd now your parents made me come to this stupid party. \"It'll make you feel better!\" they told me. What they really meant was, \"It'll make *us* feel better.\" And that's fine. They've been great this past week, and I don't mind being the strong one on the outside. I don't mind being the one who acts like there is nothing wrong. \n\nBut on the inside, I am dying. The pain just gets worse the closer it gets to midnight. I don't want to scream, \"HAPPY NEW YEAR!\" and then turn around to kiss someone who is not there. I don't want to go home to an empty house. \n\n\"Thirty seconds left! Here we go!\" I hear someone yell from the back of the room.",
        "I raised my eyebrow and turned to face her, curious about what she wanted to try out. \"Again already? Well, I'm not exactly in shape right now, but what's on your mind?\"\n\n\"Not that, silly,\" she replied, punching me playfully. \"I wanted you to... you know... read me.\"\n\nMy face instantly went red, and I scrambled up in bed. \"Hey! Don't joke like that!\"\n\n\"Who said I was joking?\" she raised her voice. \"How can you be such a prude after *that*?\"\n\n\"Th-that's different,\" I stammered, rubbing my forehead. \"That's physical.\"\n\n\"So it was just physical for you!?\"\n\n\"You know that's not what I meant!\" I protested, but she just smiled at me, teasing.\n\n\"Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. It's just such a turn on: to be completely exposed to someone you love, to know that they can hear your every thought, every little worry, every silly thing that pops into your head. And the fact that it's such a taboo doesn't help either.\" She looked up, blushing, \"Do you think I'm weird?\"\n\nI sighed, \"Yes, and that's why I li",
        "As the employer walked out of the room, closing the door behind him, he said, \"I'll give you some time to think about this, alone.\" I sat at the table, my mind racing with thoughts. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and all I had to do was sign the contract.\n\nSuddenly, the devil appeared on my right shoulder. \"We can make this decision quick,\" he said. \"Sign the contract. Isn't this what you've always wanted?\" \n\nI began to envision the opportunities that would open up for me. \"Yes!\" I shouted. \"I'd be able to finally put my work out there for the world to see!\"\n\nThe devil chuckled. \"Yes, yes. Now, tell the employer you're ready to sign.\"\n\nBut then, the angel appeared on my left shoulder, interjecting, \"What good would this be? What would you really get in exchange?\" \n\nThe angel had a valid point. The contract was mediocre, the job demanded so much, and, most importantly, I would be sacrificing the precious, limited time I had left with my mother, who was gravely ill. \n\n\"Guys, I don't know what to do!\" I exclaimed, my words tumbling out, as anxiety took hold. \"I can't just leave my mother now. But the money, I could make so much, and I\u2014\"\n\nBefore I could finish, the employer, returning, interrupted, \"Sorry, I took so long.\"",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves the narrative flow and emotional impact:\n\n---\n\n\"10, 56, 27, 9, 27, and\u2026 41!\"\n\nPatrick O'Witty held the coffee-stained lottery ticket in a quivering hand, his red-rimmed eyes staring at the flickering television screen in utter disbelief. His eyes began to itch and burn when he realized he hadn't been blinking. He checked the numbers several times, certain he was mistaken. The numbers on those silly white ping pong balls inexplicably lined up with the ticket in his hand. The audience on the television applauded and the host displayed a collection of pristine, gleaming teeth as he smiled at the camera.\n\nHe won.\n\nPatrick O'Witty was a billionaire.\n\nHis heart began to race as he reverently set the small paper on an end table, his mind struggling to comprehend what was happening. A burning mixture of anxiety and glee made him light-headed. Luck had finally turned in his favor.\n\nBefore this moment, Patrick had been recovering from a terribly unfair divorce settlement, struggling to make ends meet. He had been working double shifts at Weinmeier's, a local grocery store chain that had been slowly but steadily growing. Paul Reichart, the assistant produce manager, had been selected to head their new store over in Boughtown. That left an open promotion and Patrick knew he was the favorable selection.\n\nHe wouldn't need that anymore.\n\nHe'd never worry about money again.\n\nBut it only took one week for Patrick O'Witty to realize that sudden and incredible wealth isn't what he thought it would be.\n\nThe phone was ringing again.\n\n\"Hullo?\"\n\n\"Pat?\" the voice sounded slightly muffled and entirely unfamiliar.\n\n\"Yeah?\" he rubbed his throbbing temples with an unsteady hand.\n\n\"Pat! My God, it's good to hear your voice! It's your cousin, Tamara!\" Patrick couldn't confirm or deny if he even had a cousin named Tamara.\n\nHe hadn't heard from any of his family in over a decade, yet the past week had the phone ringing off the hook with aunts, uncles, second-cousins, twice and thrice removed. He did a little googling but still didn't understand what that meant.\n\nPatrick set the phone down gently on the cradle as the excited voice jabbered on the other end. He'd been warned this might happen, and he had tried to prepare himself for it. The sudden barrage of concerned family only accentuated the loneliness that had consumed his life for so long.\n\nHe winced as an authoritative knocking suddenly struck his front door. A strange social anxiety had made an unwanted appearance in those gloomy days. Frequent visitors and press came to his home to offer their hollow congratulations on his near record-breaking jackpot win. He sat behind curtained windows, pretending he wasn't home, visibly cringing until the knocking ceased and the unwelcome guests went away.\n\nHe shot a glance at the red polo shirt that hung on an arm chair in the darkened living room, forgotten.",
        "He reached back to feel it again. It was still there. He tied his shoes and adjusted his tie in the mirror, then touched it once more. The small round knob, barely the size of a thimble, protruded from his neck just above his snow-white collar. His inner monologue raced with questions. \"How long has it been there? Should I see a doctor? Does everyone have one? Impossible, I would have noticed. But I just noticed mine. Can everyone see it?\" He touched it again, still there.\n\nBarry Roper, an average height, slender, quiet, shy, clumsy, and notably unlucky man, was taking his chance today. He loathed his days emptying the trash cans along the residential neighborhoods and was unsatisfied with his constant financial desperation. Renting a small studio apartment, he was perpetually drowning in stress and anxiety, fearing his car wouldn't start. Barry finally dug up the courage to do something about it.\n\nBarry's true passion was cards. He never missed a televised high stakes game of Texas Holdem and Pot Limit Omaha. He dreamt of building a bankroll and taking it to Vegas, where his name would be mentioned among the greatest players. Barry had been practicing dealing cards alone in front of his television, watching old tapes of poker world championships, and he knew he was a good dealer.\n\nThen, that morning, the dial appeared. Barry twisted his back and leaned into the mirror to get a better look. White lines, raised like scars, wreathed the brassy knob. Alternating lines were marked with digits increasing in value going clockwise around the peculiar blemish, starting with 0 near the eight o'clock position and ending at 16 on the other side. Just above the knob sat a triangle pointing at the number seven. Barry gingerly caressed the newly discovered anatomy, feeling the cold, hard shell. He tugged it gently, knowing it wouldn't be painless to remove.\n\nThoughts raced in Barry's mind. \"What are the numbers? What will happen if I turn it? Will it even turn? Maybe it's just an odd mole, and I'm imagining things. Stress and nerves. That's what it is.\" He couldn't resist. Grasping the knob between his fingers, he carefully slid his thumb towards his palm. With a barely audible 'click,' the arrow now pointed at the number eight.\n\nAlthough there were no immediate effects, Barry had the distinct impression that he shouldn't do that again. It felt wrong, unnatural. Yet, at the same time, his anxiety dissipated into a level-headed calm. \"It's been there for a long time; I just never noticed. It seems like no one else does either.",
        "The blinding headlights cut through the dark, stormy atmosphere.  A deafening crash, the crunch of metal against bone\u2014I felt the impact against my small body, yet pain was absent. Numbness, a perverse benefit of this afflicted state. Lying on the cold, hard, wet road, life ebbed away, breath shallowing as the distant wail of a siren faded into the encroaching darkness.\n\nThen, abruptly, my eyes fluttered open. I could breathe again. I was sitting on something soft, comfortable, white.  Gone were my torn, dirty clothes, replaced by skinny jeans and black Converse, the uniform of my high school days.  As my vision cleared, I saw a small bed in a blue bedroom, adorned with trophies and awards. Muffled music and voices drifted from somewhere beyond.  A wave of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washed over me, unsettlingly familiar.\n\nAcross the room, in a similar bed, lay my ex-husband, looking a decade younger.  The dark circles, the scabs on his face and arms\u2014all gone. He looked sober, healthy, a sight unseen for twelve long years.  He opened his eyes, caught my gaze, and a mischievous grin spread across his face. He rose, walked over, and stood at the edge of my bed, leaning in.  With a chuckle, he reached into his jeans pocket, pulling out a pipe and a small baggie filled with what I instantly recognized as meth.\n\n\"Try some,\" he said. \"It won't hurt.\"",
        "I was stunned. The apparition's proposal seemed simply too good to be true. \u201cYou mean to tell me, you will grant me one \u2013 just one wish \u2026 anything I want?\u201d Doubt, or maybe it was skepticism, crept into my mind, churning away at the potential and the risk.\n\nThe apparition nodded, thin lips curling into a charming wry grin \u2013 too charming. \u201cThat's about the size of it, mortal,\u201d he answered. His words echoed through my consciousness \u2013 a gravelly, singsong tenor \u2013 as if every syllable hinted of Damocles.\n\n\u201cBut at what cost?\u201d I asked, turning my attention to the brass vessel from whence he came, taking refuge from his countenance in the filigree etched into its contours. In those etchings, I found some odd sense of peace. When I returned my attention to the apparition, he merely shrugged. \u201cNone that I could hold over you, mortal. Once the wish is made, I'll hold no power over you. From there, what you make of your wish is up to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight \u2026 I'd like a do-over, then. I want to go back and change my greatest mistake.\u201d The apparition sighed, eyes rolling as he ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cAre you sure, mortal? Is that all you want? No riches? No power?\u201d\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\u201cKnowledge?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even women?\u201d\n\n\u201cMen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither,\u201d I answered. \u201cI just want to go back and correct my biggest mistake.\u201d\n\nAgain the apparition sighed, shoulders slumped in resignation. \u201cVery well, mortal \u2026 your wish is granted.\u201d In an instant, my world was consumed by light.\n\nSomething about this seemed all too familiar. \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d I muttered, thrusting my hands in my pockets as I looked away.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d the apparition demanded.\n\n\u201cThis all just feels familiar. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\u201d At that, he just laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat? What's so funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou begin to see, mor\u2014 \u201c\n\n\u201cALBERT! My name is Albert, not \u2018mortal.\u2019\u201d The apparition clutched his belly in uproarious laughter, speaking through gasps and snorting chortles as he attempted to collect himself. \u201cI know \u2013 you've told me! \u2013 HA! More than once!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I don't see what's so funny about all this. I know I told you. Just now!\u201d\n\n\u201cHa! More than that, mor\u2014 \u201c\n\n\u201cALBERT!\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, fine, Professor. We've been at this game long enough.\u201d\n\nThis game? Something about those words felt \u2026 wrong. Feeling faint, I found myself slumping weakly into my chair. Dizzy, heedless of the clutter, I lay my head on the desk.\n\n\u201cOh poor, dear Albert,\u201d the apparition began. \u201cIt must seem like nothing makes sense anymore. We've been at this game for so long now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's hardly been ten minutes,\u201d I muttered.\n\n\u201cTen minutes upon tens of minutes, upon tens of minutes and more.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going on about?\u201d He snorted in amusement, clacking his teeth several times.",
        "My hands have always known what to do, alienated from the rest of my body, deformed. They never needed me.  I had always felt passion but was never molded by it, until now.  I found the edge, that line in my mind, and tossed myself across.  The pain is real.  A tangy mix of blood and sweat fills my mouth.  The blood is burning my eyes.\n\nMy hands are crafting something beautiful. I can feel it.  The stone floor sprawls with its cold glow.  My hands shift carefully, crafting my art. I feel alive. My soul wants to scream, wants to yell, but all I hear is laughter.  It bounces off the walls, breaking the silence, breaking my mind.\n\nWhere is the joy? In this moment of epiphany, I feel none. I realize now I have been forcing the emotion all along. This rage, this\u2026 *this* is what defines me.\n\nI can feel myself seizing, shaking, filling with the rage that has always defined me. A growl, a wicked tune, bellows from the deepest parts of my soul. I feel better. I do it again, cracking the silence with the sound.\n\nThe blood dries, sticking to my face. My damp sleeve rubs against my eyes. I can fucking *see*. The room is still dark, but my pupils shift, adjusting.\n\nHow did I get here? What is happening?  My eyes focus. I see what my hands have wrought. A masterpiece.  This guy\u2026 he had the wrong idea.  He thought he was going to teach *me* a lesson. He should have left me alone. He should never have come in here.  I want to scream, but the laughter is too loud.\n\nThe door moves. The laughter continues. A shadow advances.  I clench the bone fragment \u2013 a trophy from the prisoner\u2019s jaw \u2013 and move into the shadow. I thrust, putting my weight behind it, aiming to stop its advance. The laughter fills the room.\n\nThe shadow gasps as the door swings open, light flooding in.  The shadow crawls, retreating.  I have the upper hand.  I trace a line across the shadow\u2019s neck with the bone fragment.\n\nThe siren breaks the laughter. I take the badge from the shadow's belt. I can\u2019t stop laughing.\n\nI move towards the hallway, the laughter echoing.",

Relief flooded through him\u2014she was alive. This moment was everything.

Retrieve his holotags, and let's continue,\" Daemus commanded.\n\n\"Sir Daemus,\" Initiate Joyce interjected, her voice ringing with uncertainty, \"Is this gold worth the risk?\"\n\n\"This isn't about treasure, Joyce.

That's an order,\" Daemus declared as the ceiling crumbled, casting a dim light on the group.\n\nAfter stripping Clark's body of supplies, Halter tossed a flare down the hall, signaling their onward movement.\n\nAs the flare illuminated an intersection, gunfire erupted, briefly lighting up the corridor before fading into darkness.\n\n\"Another turret!\" Liam exclaimed, as the team cautiously approached the suspected location.\n\nFollowing a brief explosion and moment of tension, Liam confirmed, \"It's down.\"\n\nNavigating through a maze of corridors and encountering turret resistance, they finally reached the grand entrance.\n\n\"We should be close, sir. The vault lies ahead,\" Halter reported, relieved. \"The turrets here seem inactive, possibly controlled by a separate mainframe.\"\n\n\"Proceed slowly and watch for traps,\" Daemus advised, wary of potential dangers from the past.\n\nUpon reaching the other side without incident, the team breathed a collective sigh of relief, knowing their mission was nearing its end. Before them stood the imposing door of the vault, containing the nation's former gold reserves and invaluable knowledge.\n\n\"Halter, access the terminals. If necessary, we may need to breach a wall,\" Daemus instructed.\n\nWith tense keystrokes and heavy silence, Halter worked to unlock the vault, surrounded by the flickering emergency lights and the glow of the terminal.\n\nAfter a nerve-wracking wait, Halter's triumphant cry marked the opening of the vault, revealing the long-dormant treasures within.\n\nHowever, their victory was short-lived as a missile detonated, triggering automated defenses within the room, unleashing a barrage of gunfire from sentry bots.\n\n\"Get inside the vault!\" Daemus commanded amidst chaos, realizing they were under attack.\n\nIn the ensuing firefight, the team sought refuge behind the door, realizing Halter had fallen, his sacrifice echoing the impending danger.\n\n\"Can we seal the door?\" Joyce cried out, her desperation palpable.\n\nLiam, with limited options, prepared his remaining grenades, as Daemus made a risky decision.\n\nIgnoring protests, Daemus planned a daring move to access the servers amidst the chaos. With a moment of unity, they executed a diversion to allow Daemus a chance to reach the servers.\n\nAs Daemus fought through the perilous path, he felt the impact of gunfire but pressed on, driven by duty. Despite the odds, he managed to reach the server room, sealing himself in to complete the vital transmission.\n\nWith the transfer underway, Daemus left a poignant message of valor and sacrifice before succumbing to his injuries, his final act ensuring the legacy of the fallen team.\n\nIn the quiet aftermath, as Daemus closed his eyes and drifted into eternity, his spirit rested knowing he had fulfilled his duty with honor.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# Secret Agents Are People, Too\n\nFew understand the profound tedium that comes with serving in a clandestine organization. Recruitment hinges heavily on appearance\u2014specifically, your ability to blend seamlessly into any crowd. The ideal candidate possesses entirely unremarkable features, devoid of any distinguishing characteristics. Once selected, you vanish from society, taking extraordinary precautions to avoid acquiring even the smallest visible scar.\n\nThey even install padding on shower heads. Yes, really.\n\nThe aesthetic sensibilities of these agencies don't help matters. Whoever serves as their interior decorator seems to believe that grey represents the pinnacle of excitement. Should I suddenly become colorblind, I doubt I'd notice any difference.\n\nAs agents, we're granted one small mercy: the ability to choose our own code words. Someone mercifully recognized that clear communication\u2014while speaking through the world's tiniest microphones over impossibly weak wireless networks\u2014might be crucial to mission success.\n\nWe spend countless hours in soundproof chambers, testing our ability to understand one another. Only phrases achieving at least 99.7% comprehension success make the cut as approved code words. Trust me, reaching a statistically valid sample size at 99.7% requires an exhausting amount of whispered repetition.\n\nNaturally, we begin with plausible phrases\u2014things that wouldn't raise suspicion if overheard: \"I wonder if I left the oven on\" or \"Shit, there's Miranda, she looks hot tonight.\" It's fascinating how a diverse mix of regional accents can render even simple phrases unintelligible when transmitted with audio quality comparable to gargling marbles while drowning in pancake batter.\n\nThus, \"Thank God\" became our signal for \"extreme danger,\" while \"full of spiders\" came to mean \"target is watching the entry door.\" Through extensive testing and no small measure of frustration, \"my crotch\" emerged as our code word for the President\u2014its clarity and distinctness making it the perfect choice.",

It was a hall, lined with weapons leading off into eternity; a never-ending misperspective, mocking my mere humanity. Immediately to my left, a thin blade, barely the width of my thumb, was lodged into an obsidian stone. To my right, the legendary weapon *Masamune*, as wielded by the nemesis Sephiroth from the game *Final Fantasy VII*, stood proudly. The weapons continued onwards, singing their hymnal call. \n\nBut not for me. My path lay in vengeance, and I feared I was disallowed from all of the weapons. The chorus of metal and wood sang, louder and more vicious with each step. I had barely spent a minute wandering that infinity, when suddenly, there was silence, like a library. \n\nA clarion call, in quadruple harmony, echoed through the hall. **You are mine, Singer. I shall reveal myself to you momentarily.** I stood, wondering what would happen, when the impossible did. The hall shrank, the weapons chanting, *An-ka-hei-la, An-ka-hei-la, An-ka-hei-la-an-ka-HEI!*\n\nA solemn silence. A pedestal. Vengeance. Solemnity. A glimmer. Blindness.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n\"Well, what's so different about it that we can't just use any sensation?\" asks the woman in the tweed jacket. She sits across our conference table, her beady eyes and judgmental expression all too familiar. They're always like this. Every time a new mayor is elected, they come to me questioning the source of their power. Such naive children. Some lessons must be learned the hard way.\n\n\"Other sensations are mediated by larger and more... secure axons in our body. Their transmission from source to spinal column is much more rapid than the transmission of pain.\" Explaining this while containing my contempt is a trial in itself, but it's what I'm here for. Previous mayors were content to sit in their offices and reap the rewards of their position without action. \"When a splinter enters your foot, which do you feel first? The grain of the wood or the throbbing of split skin?\" I pause, letting her think. \"Pain is delayed. Much easier to tap into.\"\n\n\"If you're tapping into the neurons, why can't you just give them anesthesia so they don't feel the pain?\" A logical question\u2014I wasn't expecting that.\n\n\"Anesthesia blunts the transmission before it reaches the only probe site we can use; it would ruin the whole process. The subject must be awake and feeling everything.\" A quick lie. I've become very efficient.\n\n\"That's... unfortunate...\" She's hesitant, uncomfortable with this truth. It's working out as before\u2014perfect.\n\n\"Would you like to see one of our chambers? Theoretical explanations are wonderful, but I believe the process must be seen to understand why we do what we do for our immense energy needs.\" She goes pale but nods. I lead her through our multitude of passageways, all plain and windowless. \"As you can see, we are not the torture houses of yore. We don't keep our subjects in squalor. It would serve no benefit to have them uncomfortable between sessions.\" She nods along. We stop before a door marked 'Observation Room A.'\n\n\"I'm not so...\"\n\n\"Come now, you must understand how necessary this is. It would be a disservice to your office to remain ignorant.\"\n\n\"I... you're correct.\" She straightens her posture. As we enter the room, all color drains from her face. The observation room is small, with a large window into the next chamber. A technician stands to one side, wearing white garb and protective gear. Beside him, a table displays knives, pliers, saws, and needles. In the center, the subject dangles from the ceiling, arms chained to opposing walls, feet barely touching the floor. A multitude of wires run from his back to the wall. His head hangs limp, tears streaming down to his chest. Incisions mark his body.\n\n\"As you can see, we've inserted probes into each ganglion root\u201448 in total. These intercept the pain response and create the energy we need. We remove the tongue and larynx to keep noise levels down. We do that after inserting the probes\u2014no wasted energy here.\" I smile at her.\n\n\"This... this is sick...\" She's reeling, fighting her gag reflex.\n\n\"Yes, but necessary. Need I remind you that without us, the city would be without power to keep the citizens placated?\"\n\n\"We have to find another way. This is disgusting.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure another way exists. We no longer have fossil fuels, the winds aren't strong enough around us, and we don't get enough sun. Until we have a better energy source, this is our only option.\"\n\n\"I'll find another option.\" She raises her head and stares directly at the man, color returning to her face as she turns to me, her eyes unyielding. \"Thank you for your continued service.\" She shakes my hand and leaves. The technician turns to the window.\n\n\"Do you think she'll find another source? The last mayors never seemed to care enough,\" he asks.\n\n\"She damn well better\u2014we only have enough oil to last us another three years. Get Frank down from there; he looks stupid.",
        "I was drunk. Now, I'm sobering up. Not smoothly, but with a jarring crash landing into a state considerably worse than my starting point. I have to be at work in an hour. If I close my eyes now, I doubt they'd open again.  I glance in the bathroom mirror.\n\nJesus Christ.  I must have vomited so violently I've burst blood vessels in my eye. The left one. No, the right. Mirror images are reversed, right? Or is that cameras? Maybe I'm still drunk.  Either way, the white of my eye is bloodshot red.\n\nI can do this. I need energy. I splash cold water on my face. Good. A tiny jolt of life returns. Music! I fumble with my phone and hit a playlist. Shit. It's a sappy love song from my breakup with\u2026 what's-her-name? Lip tattoo girl. Oh well, volume up.\n\nCold water: check. Music blasting: check. Now for the final touch: action movie kung fu.  I grab my jacket from the floor and put it on. The sleeves are key.  They make the *swooshing* sound effects. Like Neo blocking punches in the Matrix. I start throwing rapid-fire punches, adrenaline pumping, *swoosh, swoosh, swoosh*.\n\nI punch the shower curtain. It's surprisingly solid. And it screams.\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\nI yank back the curtain to reveal a naked man huddled in the corner of my tub, clutching his bloody nose. I'm too exhausted for this.\n\n\"Hey, why are you in my shower?\"\n\n\"I lost my keys,\" he says, \"and I just opened the door to this apartment to see if there was a phone. So I could call for a ride. My friend! To call my friend!\"\n\n\"That makes no sense. You're naked. In my shower. What are you *doing*?\"\n\nHe removes his hand from his nose.  It's me. Me from ten years ago. What the fuck?\n\n\"Hey, you're me. Twenty-five-year-old me. What the hell?  Ghost of Christmas Past?\"\n\nHe looks at me like I'm an idiot.  \"The Ghost of Christmas Past wasn't actually Scrooge from the past, dumbass. And I'm twenty-six. Me.\"\n\n\"I don't have the energy for this. Just tell me, and then I'm off to work.\"\n\nHe sighs. \"Fetishes get\u2026 advanced in the future. You think people know your shit *now*? In the future, we\u2019re all so connected, everyone\u2019s kinks are public knowledge.  What's perverse today is vanilla tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Drunk. Tired. Work in an hour.  Get to the point.\"\n\nHe looks at me with pity.",
        "*Hi Britney, I didn't see you over there. Come here, you don't have to be afraid. I'm God.*\n\n\"Like the all-powerful capital G-O-D? OMG!\"\n\n*Please don't use my name in vain.*\n\n\"Like oh my god? Okay, since you're like my biggest hero I won't ever say it again.\"\n\n*No. Don't ever repeat OMG, YOLO, LOL, and really most acronyms. The only acronym that I will respond to is BAMF.*\n\n\"BAMF?\"\n\n*Before understanding the nature of BAMF, you must first read the story of Jesus.*\n\n\"I love stories, especially romance. Romance is my favorite. Did you ever watch The Notebook?\"\n\n*I read the book, but was deeply disappointed with the movie. Hollywood can't ever get it right.*\n\n\"It was a book?\"\n\n*Forget about The Notebook....*\n\n\"But I love The Notebook. I could spend an eternity talking about it. It's seriously, my favorite movie.\"\n\n*Please don't interrupt me again, understood?\"\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n*Before I was rudely interrupted, I was going to explain something to you, but I have lost my train of thought. Oh yes, do you believe everything happens for a reason?\"\n\n\"Of course. After JT left N'Sync, I bawled my eyes out, like, how could you, Justin!? Really, he just wanted to be independent. Today, we're blessed with FutureSex/LoveSounds.\"\n\n*Exactly, even though, in my opinion, N'Sync was a better musical act, I will let that blasphemy slide.*\n\n\"You wish!",
        "Ben felt the large man's fist connect with his jaw.  Five hours. Five hours these men had been working him over.  Blood filled his mouth, his right eye was useless, and at least two ribs were likely cracked or broken. He spat out a mixture of blood and saliva, then straightened his head, locking eyes with his interrogator.\n\n\"The last guy hit harder,\" he rasped. \"And he hit like a bitch. Who taught you how to punch?\"\n\nAnother blow sent his head snapping back.  His vision swam with bursts of light, and a high-pitched ringing filled his ears.  It hurt, sure, but he\u2019d endured worse back home. He shook his head slightly, working his tongue around the inside of his mouth.\n\n\"No, see, you gotta turn your hip into it.  You can't just flail like that.\"\n\nThis was the fourth interrogator.  The first had tried to be \u201ccivil,\u201d offering food, a better cell, an end to the beatings.  Ben had laughed\u2014and bitten the man's ear off when he got too close.  After that, the real fun had started. Clubs, electric shocks, attempted suffocation\u2014nothing worked.  Now, he was facing a gorilla of a man, all muscle and seemingly no brains.  The man was winded, knuckles red and swollen, and Ben, instead of breaking, was goading him further into a rage. The brute planted his hands on his knees, sucking in deep breaths. Ben could see the sweat beading on his forehead and arms.\n\n\"Taking a break?\" Ben taunted. \"Time for tea and a little nap? Don't worry about me. I'm tied up. I can wait.\"\n\nThe big man's head snapped up, eyes blazing with fury. He cocked back his right fist, aiming for Ben's face.  Ben leaned into the punch, meeting the fist with the top of his head.  A sickening crack echoed through the room. The giant staggered back, clutching his hand.\n\n\"Oops. Did I break your hand? Sorry, pal.  Sounds painful.\"\n\n\"That's it! I don't care anymore!\" The interrogator snarled, reaching behind his back with his left hand and producing a gun. \"You're not gonna talk, so I'm just going to put a bullet in your fucking skull!\"\n\nHe pressed the cold steel against Ben's forehead, thumbing back the hammer. Ben stared up at him, his gaze icy. He didn\u2019t fear death.",
        "Elmer, ever the explorer of the strange, had uncovered another temple.  This one, a simple, giant box filled with monoliths and strange tubes, lay in the heart of the Atlanta Desert.  Elmer claimed it was one of the ancients' temples of knowledge, commerce, and communication \u2013 a hub for all their activities.  This particular temple, he declared, was the largest he'd ever seen, containing thousands of monoliths, each boasting fifty drawers marked with unique symbols.\n\nAfter clearing away the overgrown vegetation, we located the entrance \u2013 a small, gray, single-person door.  \"If these temples were so vital,\" I questioned, \"how did everyone get in and out through such a tiny door?\"\n\nElmer explained, \"Nobody actually came to these temples, except for a few monks who maintained them.\"\n\n\"But you said they conducted all their business here \u2013 trading, learning, teaching. How could they do that without being present?\" I pressed, finding Elmer's explanation, as brilliant as he often was, perplexing.\n\n\"I believe they used small shrines in their homes, or perhaps prayer books, to connect to the temple,\" he offered vaguely.\n\n\"I thought you didn't believe in magic,\" I retorted. He didn't respond.\n\nI broke the lock with an axe, and we entered.  At the rear of the temple stood a giant tank filled with a foul-smelling liquid, positioned next to a peculiar machine.  Elmer believed that activating this machine would bring the temple to life. He shook the tank, then pulled a crank on the machine.  A loud growl erupted, followed by sputtering silence. After adjusting some knobs and pulling the crank again, the machine roared to life, this time remaining active.\n\nThe monoliths illuminated, shimmering with hundreds of tiny lights. We moved to a smaller side room containing several small shrines, each topped with a dark, reflective piece of glass \u2013 a window to nowhere. Elmer explained that the resident monks, whom he called \"techs,\" used these glass panels to observe the activities within the main temple.\n\nHe approached one of the shrines and pressed a button, then began tapping a series of strangely-shaped jewels.  They clicked with each touch.\n\n\"This is it,\" he announced, his voice filled with excitement. \"We've found it. This was their temple of knowledge.\"\n\nI peered into the dark glass. It now glowed, displaying images.  At the top of the display, a single word shone brightly: \"Wikipedia.\"",

The eye regenerated a moment later, ready for the next round of torment.\n\n\"Hey Bruce,\" Jasper called to his left, where his companion slowly rotated on a spit. \"You ever think you might\u2014AAAAAARRRRGH\u2014be going to Hell when you die?\"\n\n\"Nah, no way,\" Bruce replied, craning his neck to look at Jasper. \"I've been a good victim. I'm definitely getting the premium treatment when I shuffle off... I hear in Heaven they only torture you for one hour a day.\"\n\nJasper's expression fell. Another scream tore from his throat as the poker found an unspeakable new target.\n\n\"What's troubling you, man?\" Bruce asked, his face etched with concern. \"Besides those death termites crawling up your leg, obviously, hah.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Sometimes I just worry... what if I haven't been good enough? What if I end up going to\u2014AAAAARGH FUCK FUCK FUCK\u2014Hell?\"\n\n\"Shouldn't fret about that, mate,\" Bruce rasped kindly, his words barely audible through his charred larynx. \"Hell's probably just made up to scare people.\"\n```\n\nThe revised version maintains the dark humor while improving the narrative flow.",
        "Throughout my life, there have been attempts on my life. However, it all came to a halt in 1916 when I received condolence cards notifying me of the death of a certain Adolf Hitler in the trenches. I had never met the man, but I was relieved that the threats against me had ceased. On the flip side, this experience toughened me up, instilling in me a deep aversion towards people. This, combined with my natural inclination for manipulation, led me to venture into politics. I have a grand vision for Germany, one that I believe will shape its future. While I won't divulge the specifics, I can say that it may involve a significant conflict, which the Jewish community may not approve of. What adds a touch of irony to the situation is a printing error on the signs for my inaugural large-scale public gathering.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that creates a more coherent narrative flow, organizing the fragments into a psychological descent that better reveals the narrator's deteriorating mental state:\n\n---\n\nHave you ever stared at the sky?\nIt's so fucking boring.\nI've been here for hours, and you still hate me, and no matter how much I don't get it.\nIt's not even blue!\n\nYou don't remember? But we had so much fun!\nWe wanted this, remember?\nAll of us, just.... so much fun < 3\nI wore the hat, and you wore the dress, and the others.... well, you remember. We all had our places! Our roles!\nAnd you....\nWell, not yet. We have a lot left, don't we?\n\nI wanted you to die, even when I first met you. You were so perfect, and wonderful, and you completed me. I AM NOT COMPLETE. I AM BROKEN. So, of course, you were in the wrong here.\n\nThey say 'Let's get creative!' and then they just pour colour on themselves and gobble down birds and snakes, and I don't really get it. You didn't, either, so I felt something for you, again, but it was only temporary.\nYou held your hand out, felt the feathers and scales, pressed the colour forward and made everyone around you listen.\nNot that you had anything to say, but everyone listened to your silence, and they were mesmerised.\nI needed you then. So much. But your hat said 'no' and I couldn't blame it.\nAlso, I wore the wrong colour, so it wouldn't have made sense anyway. You know how it is!\n\nBack in our places, I saw you again, and you were.... fucking ugly, actually. I was gonna write BEAUTIFUL, RADIATING LIKE A SUNSET AT NIGHT but you were so fucking ugly and just, you know, yourself.\nThough, in itself, that was impressive, and kind of.... hot? You were so god damn hot! Like, literally burning. Fuck.\nThere was a pool nearby though, so it was all planned and good, and you did break your head but what can you do. Not every plan works perfectly.\n\nAnd NOW, when I'm trying to make EVERYTHING go right - you fucking hate me!?",
        "The woman at the bar, Carolyn Hendersen, wasn't very attractive. But these little distractions came with the territory.  She polished off another gin and tonic, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand\u2014sloppy, given her social position as the most controversial politician on the market. I knew this, of course. I always did my homework. I also knew her husband had left her wanting.  Any flirtatious implication from me was a baited hook.\n\n\"Sssoo, what it is that you do, again?\" she slurred.  The grammatical error would have made me shudder if not for my practiced stone-cold composure.\n\n\"Public service,\" I replied smoothly, signaling the barkeep. I slipped him a bill, requesting more alcohol for the lady.\n\nShe giggled. \"You know who I is, or am, don't you?\"\n\n\"Carolyn Hendersen,\" I answered with a slight smirk, hoping it seemed seductive, not offensive.  But her intoxication would obliterate any negative implications.\n\nShe took the bait, laughing heartily. \"Some people pay good to have their things take care of. But I don't take no bribes from nobody. That's why they're so mad all the time! But I tell 'em, I say, 'It's not gon' na matter to me! Only thing matters is the good of the country, and that's what I'm doin'!\" She threw back the next drink as soon as it arrived.\n\nLeaning in, she whispered with an unappealing seductive smile, \"So are you friend or foe, Mr. Jenkins?\"\n\nJenkins wasn't my real name. One always used an alias on the job.  Being a hitman in these times was one of the most hazardous occupations. Our lives were a constant \"dying a thousand deaths.\" For some, this was enjoyable; a way to conquer the fear of death. For the rest of us, it was torture. Dying to live, but seeing no other way.\n\n\"Why, Carolyn, do you really believe I could be anything but a friend to a woman such as yourself?\" I raised an eyebrow.\n\nA devilish look crossed her face.  \"Do you care that I have a husband?\" she mumbled, even closer. The stench of alcohol, sterile and calming, flooded my nostrils. A familiar scent, a reminder of my purpose.\n\nI slipped an arm around her waist, steadying her, controlling the situation. \"It doesn't matter to me. I'm in public service, remember?\" I paused for her reaction.  She pressed her head against my shoulder, nuzzling my neck.\n\n\"Let's go back to my place,\" I whispered in her ear.\n\nCarolyn giggled, stumbling to her feet, fumbling with her expensive peacoat. \"Lead the way, hot stuff,\" she commanded, poking me in the chest and winking.\n\nOutside, the crisp autumn air was a harsh reminder of things to come.  *The alcohol will numb the pain,* I thought, pulling her toward the parking lot.\n\n\"Which of them is yours?\" she muttered.\n\nThen, a new plan, a lightning strike of inspiration. A chance to avoid the pain of another death.  I'd died a thousand times already. This was an escape. I couldn't say if every job was worth the money, but given my situation, I had no other choice.\n\n\"Actually, my dear, I have a chateau with a hot tub and champagne just across the street. Mind if we walk? We've both had too much to drive.\"\n\nShe clicked her tongue. \"You'll just owe double when we get there!\"\n\n\"Don't worry, love, you'll be treated with the utmost care,\" I chuckled falsely.\n\nAt the edge of the road, I restrained her. \"No, there's a car coming!\" I shouted, ensuring potential witnesses heard.\n\nShe waved dismissively. \"You tell me when to cross then, babe.\"\n\nI waited, spotting a swerving vehicle with no headlights.  \"Go now,\" I whispered, tugging her wrist.\n\n\"I'm readyyyy!\" she yelled, stumbling into the road, arms flung wide.\n\nAs the car hurtled towards her, I emitted a perfectly timed bellow and lunged forward, a futile gesture.\n\nThe impact sent her body flying. A crack echoed. A scream from the car. It crashed into a tree.\n\nAn older couple rushed over. \"What happened?\" they panted.\n\nFeigning distress, I stammered, \"She was drunk\u2026 I was walking her home\u2026 She ran out\u2026 No lights\u2026 I've been drinking too\u2026 Oh God! My fault!\" My body trembled convincingly. No pain. No pain this time. This bounty\u2026 maybe I could retire.\n\n\"Young man, it's not your fault,\" the woman soothed, patting my back.",

Anything else, really. I've never experienced this before. Do you know anyone who's had something like this? I feel so anxious! I walk over to my wardrobe, start to open it, and then, these violins, trilling back and forth, get louder and louder. I know there's nothing inside, but this music makes me worry, nonetheless. You couldn't even imagine. \n\nWow. My song has been like this for over two hours. If it weren't so anxiety-inducing, I reckon I'd be bored, that's how repetitive it is. Do you think I should see a doctor? Yeah, I think that's a good idea, too. I'll wait a couple more hours, and, if it hasn't modulated back, I'll head to the clinic. I should probably write down my symptoms.",
        "Looking at his carefree face from below as he was slowly transported towards me on the escalator, I already knew.  He was in for a seven on the Bristol scale, just hours away. I wondered, not for the first time, if I should warn him. But how could I tell him? How could I tell anyone?\n\nHow could I explain that I could see the future, their fate? That I could feel the forces at work, often without their knowledge and beyond their control, inside their own bodies?  That I could see the shape of things to come? That I was a coproscognitive?\n\nNobody would believe me.  Not without a few proven predictions, and few humored me long enough to witness those predictions come true. This guy didn't have that luxury of time. He needed to believe me about the very next event I foresaw, and there was no way to convince him in the short time we had.\n\nHe was going down, and I was going up.  As the escalator carried us past one another, I stayed silent, leaving him to his fate. I could only hope he would be close to the right place two hours and thirteen minutes from now. I knew it would be fast and explosive, and without my warning, he'd have little time to run for salvation.\n\nI put him out of my mind. I had my own future to worry about, and I didn't need my gift to tell me about it. I started looking for the signs pointing the way to the nearest lavatory.",
        "Haley sat down, a satisfied smile on her face, inhaling the calming scent of valerian tea.  The routine was familiar now: lights off, curtains drawn tight, sealing out the world.  The only goal was sleep before midnight.\n\nAnd she did.\n\n07:00 AM, Friday 25th of March, 2017. Haley awoke and marked another line on her calendar \u2013 thirty-seven in total.  The familiar sounds of a street argument drifted in through the window: the honking, the shouting.  It was a scene she could picture perfectly.\n\nThe city bustled, even at this early hour.  Haley navigated the crowded streets with practiced ease, sidestepping an errant elbow, hopping over a dirty puddle, and finding her usual spot in line at the coffee shop.  She noticed so much more now, small details, fleeting moments that most people missed.  How much life went by unobserved, unappreciated.\n\nThe aroma of coffee and fresh buns filled the air.  She ordered a single cup, the name written on it not her own.  The barista's weary smile and rote greeting couldn't mask the genuine affection behind it, the care that ensured the name on the cup was always spelled correctly.\n\nAcross the street, through an ornate gate, beneath blooming pink trees, Haley walked past uniformed workers exchanging tired pleasantries as they changed shifts. Some heading home to sleep, others just beginning their day.  Haley, too, had come from her bed, but her destination, her true home, was just ahead.\n\nInside the hospital room, pale, thin fingers dug into crisp white sheets.  A pained expression twisted Peter\u2019s face, instantly smoothing into a smile as Haley entered.  \"Good morning, sunshine.\" He shifted on the bed, making space for her beside him, a silent invitation she never refused, even if it meant forgoing the uncomfortable chair.\n\n\"The barista sends her regards,\" Haley murmured, offering him the coffee and a bun, taking a bite of her own to mask the familiar pang of grief.  No matter how many times she visited, no matter how she braced herself, the sight of him wasting away stole her breath and pricked at her eyes.\n\n\"No coffee for you today?\" Peter asked, his blue eyes brightening as he inhaled the scent of the bun.",
        "Libby gazed up at me with her mismatched eyes, her head cocked to one side as it always had. Initially, it seemed like a silly quirk when she was just a pup with oversized paws and a stubby tail. It was as if she couldn't comprehend a world confined by a flat horizon. Over time, I came to see it as charming, the way she would strike a pose with one ear perked up and the other tucked back\u2014a playful greeting to all and none. But now, the gesture seemed laden with weariness, a poignant display of sadness and acceptance of the harshness of a indifferent fate.\n\nBut, of course, those were my feelings, not hers.\n\nAlthough she couldn't jump into the car as easily, her tail still wagged as I lifted her into the passenger seat. Sitting a bit taller, she made a concerted effort to prop herself up by the window, so she could observe the passing sidewalks and parks she was leaving behind. As we reached our final destination, she extended her neck to lick my hand.",
        "I had been preparing for a couple of hours. The papers were all neatly stacked, the pens filled with ink, and the blotting paper spotless. Everything was exactly as it was supposed to be, in its correct place, just as the rulebook instructed. No one could accuse me of being sloppy in my work, unlike Pieterson or Sanders, who were always making mistakes and hoping no one would notice. A blot here, a correction there\u2014it all added up.\n\nAs the grandfather clock struck nine, the first dozen claimants entered the large, oak-paneled room. I recognized Bob Gettery, the owner of a hotel I had visited once or twice, and I wondered what idea had brought him here. A couple of other faces were vaguely familiar, but I could not name them. Three, in particular, drew my attention, each more out of place than the last.\n\nThe first was a freakishly tall, pale man, with a suit cut so precisely that the seams between the arm and shoulder appeared almost drawn, rather than stitched.",
        "Day of Rest\n\n\"I'm not going to chase after them; they can escape for all I care!\" I cut off his tirade before he could finish. He was going on about some rebel using a thermonuclear warhead to destroy the planet's core. It was just a minor planet, so what if we lost it? I couldn't bear to deal with any more challenges to my driving skills, especially not today of all days.\n\n\"I'm parking this hover-car and heading to the VR plaza to take a much-needed break,\" I declared firmly.\n\nThe man in the passenger seat tensed up, his jaw clenching. Our eyes met, and after a moment, he let out a resigned sigh. \"Fine,\" he muttered.\n\nHe exited the hover-car and vanished around the corner, heading towards a noodle shack.\n\nI had finally stood up to him and taken charge of my own path. I input the coordinates and relaxed with a drink as the computer guided me to my destination.\n\nEverything felt different, in a good way. I paid the entrance fee, settled into the VR set, and leaned back. The days of chauffeuring this self-proclaimed hero around the universe were behind me.\n\nI was unfazed by the distant flashes in the holo-window or the approaching light. Those were the least of my worries. What truly saddened me was the realization that I couldn't fully savor the remainder of the day.",
        "Alone in the box, it was too dark, yet the noise from outside\u2014the tall man's booming voice, the blaring music\u2014was overwhelming. The anticipation was agonizing; he knew precisely what would happen next. The lid would open with a near-silent *schuff*, and a rough hand, reeking of some indefinable stench, would yank him by the scruff of his neck, ripping him into the blinding light.  Already too bright, the sudden transition from the darkness of the box to the stage would feel like staring into a thousand suns.  The applause, a muted roar while he was in the box, would wash over him with its full force.  The place reeked of stale beer, popcorn, and the sweat of a summer afternoon. All he could do was wait, trapped in his cramped, dark prison, dreading the inevitable. But this time was different. This time, he would have his revenge.\n\n*Schuff*. \"I'd certainly hope my hat was empty, but sometimes I have bad luck!\" The rough hand grabbed him and pulled.",
        "The odd thing about teleporting is that it\u2019s not instantaneous. Depending on the distance, materializing on the other side takes anywhere from 10 to 1,000 seconds. This usually leaves plenty of time to contemplate your purpose \u2013 or to simply zone out, as I tended to do.  The process involves a gradual coalescence, a slow return to wholeness, culminating in the world snapping into focus just as the attendant frantically waves you off the pad. This, much to my embarrassment, was precisely my experience upon arriving at New Hope Medical Clinic in Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter my clumsy dismount, I exchanged greetings with the attendant, confirmed my appointment with the pretty, blonde receptionist, and then followed an orderly to Professor Alan Templeton's room.  Templeton, the brilliant mind behind the teleportation device I\u2019d just used, had tragically succumbed to madness shortly after its creation. His psychosis, fixated on straight lines and sharp angles, remained a baffling enigma.\n\nOver the years, others had developed similar symptoms, leading to the official designation of \"Transporter Psychosis.\"  Affecting roughly one in a billion people, it was statistically safer than air travel, with only twenty-six cases recorded across Earth and the Colonies.\n\nAs we neared Templeton's room, the orderly diverted me into a smaller antechamber. \u201cPut these on, please,\u201d he instructed, proffering a set of oddly-shaped clothes.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I questioned, slightly offended.  My tweed jacket and slacks might be a bit dated, but surely not grounds for a forced wardrobe change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the lines, sir,\u201d the orderly explained with a weary sigh. \u201cYour clothes have straight lines.\u201d\n\nI glanced down at my attire, then at the garments he held.  Even the stitching flowed in curves, eschewing any hint of linearity.  With a nod of understanding, I changed. The orderly, satisfied, then guided me to a rounded door at the hallway's end. \u201cFifteen minutes, sir.\u201d\n\nThe room itself was a dome, every corner smoothed and rounded.  Professor Templeton, his white hair carefully combed back, sat perched on a beanbag chair, scribbling on circular paper.  His aversion to straight lines was clearly no exaggeration.\n\n\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d he beckoned, gesturing towards another beanbag. \u201cAnother vulture to inquire about Transporter Psychosis, I presume?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, yes?\u201d I stammered, surprised by his seemingly lucid demeanor.\n\nHe fixed me with a steady gaze. \u201cOf course I seem sane. Now sit and ask your questions.\u201d He returned to his scribbling.\n\nAs I settled onto the beanbag, attempting to formulate my questions, Templeton abruptly thrust his hand in front of my face, holding up four fingers. \u201cHow many fingers do you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, four?\u201d\n\nHe huffed. \u201cBah, four. Just like the rest of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong answer?\u201d I inquired, bewildered.\n\nHe waved his hand dismissively. \u201cYou see, but you don\u2019t *really* see. Now ask your questions.\u201d\n\nI discreetly activated my hidden recorder. \u201cProfessor, for the record, could you please verify your identity?\u201d\n\nA frown deepened on his face.  \u201cProfessor Alan Templeton, professor of Theoretical Physics, inventor of the Teleporter. Born August 31st, 2025. I have a mole on my left ass cheek known only to my mother, my wife, and four women in Barcelona.\u201d  His unexpected candor startled me into an awkward laugh, which I quickly stifled, realizing he was entirely serious.\n\n\u201cProfessor, your psychosis\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a psychosis!\u201d he roared, leaping to his feet and pacing. \u201cYou reporters are vultures, feasting on my words, but none of you truly listen! The lines!\u201d he shouted, pointing beyond the door. \u201cThe lines are the problem, not me!\u201d\n\nEmboldened, I ventured, \u201cBut what about sharp angles?",
        "Known as the greatest barbarian in the land, Rorik Ivarstead celebrated his victory over Aldrik Grimstorm in the long hall, drinking and singing merrily with his muscles bulging under his tunic. His reputation for unmatched skill with the blade preceded him, but one weakness lingered, leaving him exposed. It was this weakness that Serene Christof, seeking to avenge her husband Cyril, intended to exploit.\n\n\u201cRorik Ivarstead,\u201d Serene called out in a sultry tone, capturing his attention and revealing a flicker of fear in his eyes. With a strange satisfaction, she relished the opportunity to make him suffer for the pain he had inflicted on her family. \n\n\u201cYes, you,\u201d she responded when he questioned her, issuing a challenge to him on the anniversary of her husband's defeat. Determined to restore honor to the Christof name, she proposed a contest of combat, which Rorik hesitantly accepted in his fear and pride.\n\nAs the sun began its descent, painting the sky in hues of crimson gold, Serene stood poised with her bow at the ready as Rorik emerged from the long hall. Despite his pride and reluctance to face a woman in battle, he drew his claymore and charged towards her, hindered by the effects of the herb she had slipped into his mead.\n\nInstead of waiting for his response, Serene took aim with her bow, allowing him to see his impending fate. The arrow found its mark in Rorik's neck as he stumbled and fell, unable to continue the fight. With her vengeance achieved, Serene left him to die, returning home with a sense of closure and honor restored to the Christof name.",
        "The scientific community watched, awestruck, as a pair of crudely conjoined toasters sat within a steel-reinforced glass case.  A short, sweat-drenched man in overalls rubbed his sunburnt neck.\n\n\"I'm tellin' you, Sully\u2026it happened.\"\n\nA tall man with long, dark brown hair adjusted his sweater vest and rose from behind his podium. \"You keep saying that, Wilfred, but this is simply two toasters. This can't possibly be what you claim.\"\n\nThe short man's brow furrowed, a disturbing glint in his eyes \u2013 a look that hinted at both madness and unsettling intelligence. \"It's two toasters, I know. But it's also the solution to every problem we'll face for the next thousand years.\"\n\n\"I assure you, two kitchen appliances cannot defy the laws of thermodynamics.\"\n\nThe other experts exchanged pointed glances at Wilfred, held between two armed guards.  With a collective nod, they gestured to the guards, who shoved him forward.  \"Show us how it works,\" the sweater-vested scientist, Dr. Sullivan, demanded.\n\nWilfred approached the case cautiously, as if it housed a dangerous animal. He ran his fingers across the bulletproof glass, thick enough to withstand an elephant's weight. The scientists had insisted on the precaution, given Wilfred\u2019s claims about the device's potential power.\n\nHis hand reached inside, past a small locked hatch, and pressed down on a lever on the lower toaster.  He quickly withdrew and backed away until the butt of a rifle slammed into his face, sending a spray of blood from his nose.\n\nThe guards hauled him to his feet, gripping his bloody shirt. \"No need to run. There's certainly nothing that could hurt you *here*.\"\n\nThe toasters began to glow, the air around them shimmering with heat.  The scientists remained unimpressed. \"So far, your 'great machine' is merely producing hot air. *Impressive*.\"\n\nWilfred, ignored and bloodied, wept. Tears of fear? Sadness? Pain? Madness? No one knew, no one cared. He smeared blood across his lips with a trembling hand, staring intently at the toasters.\n\nThe lever sprang up with a light *ting*.  \"You've gone mad, Wilfred. This double-toaster can't even make twice the toast, with one stacked on top of the oth\u2013\"\n\nSuddenly, the toasters rumbled. Holes erupted in their shells, emitting beams of intense, searing light. The scientists recoiled in terror.  The room plunged into darkness, illuminated only by the toasters\u2019 now-fierce flames.\n\n\"You idiots! How much energy did you feed the device?!\" Wilfred roared.\n\nHis question went unanswered as the beams melted through the reinforced glass, slashing across the room. Wood furniture ignited, flesh seared. Screams mingled with the crackling of fire and the stench of burning.\n\nThe toasters, now a single molten mass, consumed the case entirely.  Thick smoke filled the room, obscuring everything.  The screams faded, replaced by wheezing and the occasional pop of burning wood.\n\nHours later, Dr. Sullivan stirred, lifting his face from the scorched tile floor.  He pushed himself to his knees, his body coated in soot.  The room was devastated; no toasters, no colleagues, no guards\u2026and no Wilfred.\n\nHe stumbled out into the pristine lobby, the central hub of the labs. \"Anybody? Anyone there?\"\n\nHe'd always acknowledged Wilfred's brilliance, even as the old man's inventions grew increasingly outlandish. These toasters had seemed the epitome of that descent\u2014simple in appearance, but with unknown capabilities.\n\nHe searched frantically, calling out, but the labs were eerily deserted, stripped of both personnel and equipment. Panic set in.  Reaching for his phone, he found his pocket empty.  He ran, fearing he was trapped.\n\nHe burst through the doors at the top of the winding staircase, only to be met by a hellish landscape.  Winds howled as liquid fire and lightning rained down from two colossal, winged toasters.",
        "When Cara noticed the dragon circling in the sky overhead, her heart sank.\n\nHer mind cast back to her fifteenth year, huddled in the woods with her father, Tormek, and his Soulbeast, a shrewd badger called Soomey. She clutched a poorly-made bow she had worked on for the past year. The bow string was frayed, the wood old and cracked, the arrows too thick and bulky. The arrowheads kept falling off, so she was forced to begin her first hunt with little more than sharpened sticks with downy feathers glued to the back. Her father said nothing, though his steely gray eyes and hardened face spoke volumes to her. Soomey tried to reassure her by sticking close, nuzzling against her ankles as they traversed the forest. Her father led her through a trail marked by the leather-shod feet of every fifteen-year-old beginning their journey to adulthood in their small village. The autumn air was chilly, a light breeze blowing away whatever heat remained in her body\u2014a trivial offering to the god of the forest.\n\nShe caught nothing that day, each arrow falling short of its target, bouncing harmlessly from thick hides, or falling apart in her own hands. She watched as the animals listened to the sound of her soft sobs, their ears swiveling toward her before bounding away from the presumed danger. As the sunrise turned to sunset, her father's face slowly morphed into a disapproving visage that Cara would never forget. She was the only girl in her tribe allowed the Rite of Passage, and even now, at the age of eighteen, she could still hear the Chief of her tribe's belly laughter when her father requested permission to track game in the woods with his daughter. \"She is special,\" her father had said three years ago. \"Falg the prophet has foretold it.\"\n\n\"The only thing special about a woman,\" the tribal chief had retorted, \"is her ability to bear children. But if the Prophet speaks, we listen.\" And that was the end of the conversation. As the guards led Cara and her father away from the chief's home, she tried to drown out the cackling laughter of the chief and his hyena, and the pointing and laughing of the young boys who had lined up outside the dwelling to eavesdrop. Her face was crimson with embarrassment, and she kept her head low. When her father said, \"Cara, don't pay attention to them. You *are* special, and one day you will lead these people,\" her only response was to cry so hard her ribs began to shudder.\n\nToday, the dragon landed in front of her on the path back to her village. It was roughly the size of a horse, with mottled green-blue scales that shimmered in the summer sunlight, watching Cara calmly but intently with piercing yellow eyes.\n\nHaving steeled herself for three years for this very moment, Cara said firmly, \"I don't want you.\"\n\nThe dragon tilted its head diagonally, then took a step forward.\n\n\"No,\" said Cara. \"I told you, I don't want you.\"\n\nShe began walking past it, and it responded by following her. She took a few steps forward before turning sharply on her heel and shouting, \"GO AWAY!\"\n\nThe dragon took a cautious step backward and lowered its head until it was nearly on the ground. Then, it flipped on its back, writhing on the dirt path as though scratching its back. Cara watched this curiously.\n\n\"You're not a dog,\" she said.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved flow and coherence:\n\n# The Golden Disc\n\nKazim watched as the Zoom of his warp drive shook and heated - a measurement of vacuum strength within a vacuum, a tricky thing to gauge. His contraption, cobbled together from scrap metal found in the outer rim of this solar system, was hardly elegant. But he was grateful for it, especially after discovering that golden disc in one of humanity's far-reaching space debris fields. The disc, despite its odd markings (graffiti, he assumed), contained just enough gold to transmit a high-definition message from one of their space stations.\n\nHe had his eye on one station in particular - a command center that seemed to control nearby satellites. A whole system he could broadcast from! The possibilities were intoxicating. Though the zoom of the space drive was rather annoying now, when usually he found it impressive. Then Kazim felt ridiculous - worrying about sounds in space.\n\n*They'd likely want to cut me into pieces*, he thought, considering these hostile, primitive creatures. He imagined the little simians prying and probing him with their glasses and metal tools. At least his skin was thicker than theirs - they'd have a harder time cutting him open. Something told him though, this species' danger wasn't in their brute force or sharp tools. (Their insistence on walking on two legs instead of the polite four marked them as arrogant savages compared to Protosimians, as far as Kazim was concerned.)\n\nIf they discovered the truth about his defenselessness or his odd intentions, that would be the end of it. All the more reason not to trust them! Still, he had to admit some grudging respect. For cave-dwelling primates to send valuable materials like that golden disc into space... impressive, even if they did deface it.",

        "Lost in the urban sprawl of Los Angeles, I stumbled upon a disturbing scene.  A hulking man, easily three hundred pounds and radiating menace, stood on a corner.  Intrigued, and perhaps foolishly, I decided to observe him.  My approach was a clandestine crawl beneath cars and a dash through honking traffic.  Thirty minutes later, I reached the other side, unseen.\n\nThe man was delivering a crude pick-up line \u2013 \"What up, bitch?\" \u2013 to a woman who looked both puzzled and eager to escape, yet she hesitantly approached.  He repeated his offensive greeting.  Suddenly, he lunged, his actions suggesting a gruesome attack on her face.  Horrified, I watched from just two feet away, documenting the unfolding nightmare. He then threw her into the back of a taxi.  Driven by morbid curiosity, I jumped onto the roof of the cab.\n\nThe taxi ride was short.  At a small house, the man hauled the woman inside.  Desperate to witness the conclusion of this bizarre encounter, I spotted an open window and, despite the potential danger, hurled myself through, landing with a painful thud in what appeared to be a bathroom.\n\nExiting the bathroom, I followed a dim light and a discarded piece of clothing to a room.  Inside, a brutal scene unfolded.  The man, armed with a cylindrical weapon drawn from his belt, was repeatedly striking the woman.  Her screams mingled with his grunts.  To my surprise, she fought back with ferocity.  After a protracted struggle, the woman prevailed, leaving the man defeated on the floor.  \"Really?! 300 lbs and only a couple of minutes?\" she exclaimed, her voice laced with a mixture of exhaustion and triumph.\n\nAs she walked towards the door, I realized my precarious position. I scrambled back to the bathroom and hid behind the shower curtain. But she followed. She sat down on the toilet, sounds of pain escaping her lips.  She repeated the phrase, \"Oh God.\" Then, as she stood, I slipped. Discovered.\n\nThe woman advanced.  Fearing the worst \u2013 especially after my regrettable McDonald's lunch \u2013 I braced myself.  To my astonishment, she ripped off my belt, pulled down my pants, and tore off my shirt.  Then, she pressed my face against hers.  She... copulated with me.  The interspecies act felt surreal and wrong.  After an eternity, she screamed, \"Thank you,\" and then\u2026 she bit off my head.\n\nThe moral of the story? Stay away from praying mantises that resemble humans.",

He preferred to gaze at his collection of clockwork contraptions, nodding absently to himself while stroking his whiskers.\n\n\"Oh! 'Twould make a marvelous asylum! Just imagine!\"  A dreamy look filled Miss Pottsmith's eyes, as if envisioning lunatics cavorting and frolicking together in some ritualistic reunion.  \"I shall commission it at once!\" She sipped her cold tea, humming softly to the stuffed animals arranged around her tea set.\n\nSir Egglesworth simply nodded.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n```markdown\nIt was the same ritual every month: a phone call, a conversation, an argument, an apology.\n\nThe call always came from *the company*, while the rest of the cycle played out with...*her*. After the car crash that took her legs, we'd both embraced Digital Immortality. The concept seemed perfect then\u2014she would always be present, and I would forever be there for her.\n\nEight years have passed. Four moves, two evictions, the selling of nearly everything we owned, and now this\u2014the final breaking point. Each morning, I'd power up the computer, and she'd immediately share the amusing moments from my hours asleep. She knew how much I cherished her voice, but she also understood our financial reality.\n\n\"Just unplug it, for God's sake, Brian,\" she pleaded, desperation threading through her voice. I inhaled sharply, my fist connecting with the desk.\n\n\"Don't **ever** say that again,\" I snapped, anger washing over me like a tide.\n\nThat evening, after my shift, I finally allowed myself to rest. Four jobs in one day had left me drained, and the paperwork felt insurmountable. Outside, I activated my phone. She filtered through to the camera, watching. I scattered the paperwork across the ground and set it alight, observing as the fragments and sparks pirouetted in the air like exhausted fireflies.\n\n\"Why?\" she questioned softly.\n\n\"Because I can't sustain this anymore,\" I replied, my voice heavy with sadness. The \u00a3600 monthly payment had become an impossible burden. I turned to her then, and we talked for hours. We revisited every memory\u2014from our first meeting on that school trip to my clumsy tumble into the lake. *Everything*.\n\n\"Why\u2014why this walk down memory lane?\" she asked.\n\n\"Because I need to know you died happy,\" I whispered, tears breaking free as the words escaped.\n\nThe shock hit her deeply.\n\n\"I.... Please...\" she begged, but I was already dialing.\n\n\"Hello, Future Industries. How may we assist you?\" chirped the voice on the other end.\n\n\"No!\" she cried, her voice crackling through the speakers.\n\n\"I'd like to cancel my account,\" I managed through cold tears.\n\nKeys clicked in the background while she continued her desperate pleas. Finally, I stood, gripped my phone, and hurled it against the garden tree. In that instant, she shattered.",
        "The night was typical. This neighborhood, brimming with wealth and unsuspecting residents, was my hunting ground. Their arrogance, their air of superiority, almost justified relieving them of their possessions.  They thought they were better than everyone else.  Well, if they were so smart, why leave a spare key dangling inside a birdcage by the back door? Birds make terrible guard dogs.\n\nThe kitchen was unremarkable. The living room, equally so. An Xbox One sat gathering dust \u2013 a console nobody with discerning taste wanted, rendering it worthless to me.\n\nA small collection of Buddha statues and some burning incense hinted at open-mindedness, peace, and a complete lack of repression.  Right.\n\nUpstairs, I opened the bedroom door.  My wife. Asleep in the bed. No. It just *looked* like her.  It was unsettling, uncanny.  She was alone, dead to the world \u2013 not literally, she was breathing \u2013 just deeply asleep. I moved closer.\n\nThe resemblance was astonishing.  They could have been twins.  I scanned the room and decided to take some family photos to show my wife.  She'd be more freaked out than me.\n\nMaintaining my professional composure, I pocketed a few pieces of jewelry and left quickly.\n\nBack home, I presented the jewelry to my wife.  She was unimpressed. \"I've had better,\" she quipped. That's why I loved her \u2013 her sharp wit, her ability to call me on my bullshit. We kept each other honest.  Then, I showed her the photographs.\n\nSilence.  Her eyes welled up.  The resemblance could only mean one thing: a twin sister. She had to meet her.  \"Now?\" she whispered.  \"No,\" I replied, \"it's the middle of the night.  In the morning.\"  Sleep would be elusive.\n\nWe made coffee, and the childhood stories resurfaced: her parents, early school days, the divorce, moving, new friends\u2026 the usual.  There had always been an unspoken tension surrounding her parents, a sense of something missing.  Perhaps this was the reason for their rift.\n\nNot that it mattered now.  They were gone.  It was just us. And maybe, one other.\n\nAs soon as dawn broke, we were at the house. My wife trembled with nerves, adrenaline coursing through her.  It sounded absurd, but I could almost hear her heart pounding.\n\nShe pressed the doorbell.  I stood beside her, offering silent support. Goosebumps prickled her arms. Footsteps approached.\n\nThe door opened. The moment their eyes met, pure, unadulterated rage erupted.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Elder's Tale\n\nAn elderly man sits in his weathered armchair, carefully turning the pages of an ancient leather-bound tome. Its cover bears modest hieroglyphics depicting men, griffons, and medusae. He regards his three children with a gentle smirk as they sit before him, their eyes bright with anticipation for the next story. Beside them, the fireplace crackles, its embers dancing dangerously close to the carpet yet never quite reaching it. The elder wheezes softly.\n\n\"My children, you promise to go to sleep after this one?\" They all nod fervently in unison.\n\n\"This story took place centuries into the past, beyond even you, me, and this book.\" The elder turns the book to face them before resting it back on his lap.\n\n\"Whoa, that book is older than you are?\"\n\"It must be a couple thousand years old!\"\n\"C'mon sis, let's hear the story.\"\n\nThe elder smiles at the familiar commotion that always accompanies his storytelling. The children settle down.\n\n\"After the lands formed over what would become our beloved home, people weren't as advanced as they are now,\" he leans in closer, \"not even proper bathrooms.\" The children gasp and dissolve into laughter before allowing him to continue.\n\n\"They had buildings of beauty that we still use today\u2014museums full of vast knowledge and learning. Like libraries, but bigger and more popular. Sigil, I believe, was what it was called in those times. People worshipped deities of all colors and powers, similar to the god we know today, but back then, divine power was shared.\"\n\nThe elder pauses, his expression darkening slightly. \"Gods were equals then, always competing to outdo one another. One goddess in particular ruled over all of Sigil.\" He moves his hand toward his heart, then reconsiders. \"She feared what all gods dreaded in that time: degodding\u2014when one deity strips another of their divine power, like a king being stripped of his crown.\"\n\nThe children exchange mischievous glances before returning their attention to the story. The elder reaches for a poker to tend the fire, and, staring into the flames, continues: \"Mortals\u2014people who wouldn't live forever\u2014were often involved in these 'degoddings.' One such mortal was obsessed with pyromancy, eventually growing so powerful that he rivaled the gods themselves\u2014an impossible feat, were it not for a man so determined.\"\n\nWincing slightly, the elder glances back at the book, turning a few pages. \"The reason the Lady\u2014the goddess\u2014and everyone else feared this new power of degodding was that it meant complete obliteration. No trace would remain.\" Noting the children's confusion, he clarifies, \"Imagine being here one moment, then gone the next\u2014with no one remembering you had ever existed.\"\n\nThe children's expressions mix fear with fascination as he continues, \"There was a god\u2014his name lost to time\u2014who ruled over portals. He overstepped his bounds, controlling most of Sigil that the Lady governed. She sought revenge, slaughtering all his priests and believers, outlawing his very name under penalty of... permanent grounding.\" He smirks slyly as the children's eyes sparkle with mischief. \"The goddess eliminated this god of portals and began ruling Sigil with an iron fist, ensuring no one could ever challenge her authority again.\"",
        "Sipping at my tea, I listened to the record playing in the background. It was one of my last boxes of genuine good quality Builder's Brew. I never cared much for refined tastes or the poncy ways of my fellow Brits. They were mostly just brown-haired Romans with hardly a trace of Celt in them, unless you ventured to the remote rural corners of Cornwall or Ireland where bloodlines intertwined like writhing snakes.\n\nI have been around for a very long time, living a life filled with both good and bad moments. My first wife betrayed me with a friend, my lands were ravaged beyond recognition, and even my hammer was shattered into stone fragments. The enclosures marked a significant change in England, transforming the verdant fields into artificial squares like pieces on a chessboard.\n\nI reminisced about the past, recalling the times when a Welsh land thief was hailed as a hero and the encroachment of a foreign God's influence eroded the old ways. Despite the exaggerated rumors about my abilities, I still had a connection with my people from my youthful days of fighting alongside them.\n\nAs I pondered on my mortality and the blight that afflicted me, I lamented the absence of good old-fashioned milk due to the epidemic that had devastated Coventry. In search of soya milk, I embarked on a journey to a semi-automated farm powered by electricity, seeking to cleanse myself of the blight that plagued me.\n\nReflecting on the past and the transformation of society, I longed for a return to simpler times when priests held a mystical power and men could be perceived as wizards. Despite the darkness of our past actions, there was a sense of yearning for the connection with humanity that once existed.\n\nAs the record came to an end, I contemplated the idea of visiting Japan and experiencing their advanced technology, including robots capable of holding conversations. Pondering on the differences between my kind and the more aggressive counterparts in Japan, I considered stopping in Germany for good beer before continuing my journey.\n\nRealizing that I had spent the entire day indoors watching the zombie horde outside, I decided to venture south towards the Channel. With thoughts of encountering Japanese chatbots and wondering whether to bring flowers to a robot, I embarked on a new adventure as an ancient God-king, ready to explore a world transformed by time and technology.",

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n```markdown\nI used to practice mindfulness: setting a timer, sitting still, closing my eyes, and pacing my breaths for five minutes. It's remarkable how such a brief period can expand and feel eternal in those moments. Yet paradoxically, weeks, months, and years have rushed past me in a blur.

        "Here's a restructured version of the story with improved flow and coherence:\n\nEver since I bought that new cat food, my cat had started to act strange. Stranger than normal, anyway. I frowned suspiciously at my cat. My cat frowned back. That was three weeks ago. Things have gotten very bad since. I now fear for my life, and perhaps this account will help people. I hope.\n\nI'd walk around a corner, or reach for something under the ottoman. And there she was. My cat. She would leap at my face. It seemed like fairly normal cat behavior, except that she would do it constantly, in multiple parts of my body. Almost like she was testing my reflexes....figuring out where I was weak.\n\nRecently, I had seen her walking through the house, analyzing everything. She always seemed to spend extra time near the knives I keep in the cabinet, and examined all the power tools in the garage. Almost like she was taking an inventory. One time I caught her in my office, leaning over my computer. When she saw me walk in, she made a big show of jumping down and running away. Yet -- I couldn't help but notice that my internet history had just been cleared.\n\nIt was getting very creepy when I'd walk in a room, usually when I was back from work earlier than I had expected, and find a circle of cats assembled on my floor. They would be in a circle, with my cat sitting at the head, like they were having a frickin' seance or something. Sometimes there would be books laid out by them.... often gruesome, deathly books that depicted horrific executions and torture.\n\nI'd be taking a shower and when I came out....there she was. Sitting on the counter, just watching me. A completely straight face, unblinking. Yet something always seemed.....sinister.... about those eyes. Then the killing started. Oh, the killing. Dead birds -- then came the dead raccoons, and otters, and soon enough a fox then a wolf....what kind of cat kills a fox?\n\nI was worried, so I thought about bringing my cat to the vet. Like they could do anything. Little did I know it, but she was beyond help then. I wasn't, but I didn't know that yet either. She always resisted the visits to the vet though. Honestly, it creeps me out to be with my cat all day in my house.... with her always watching. Sometimes I'd just go to the pub, and talk to whoever was there. Cheer up, have a drink, and watch the game with the guys in the pub. I'd have a lengthy conversation with the mailman when he stopped by, just to have a person to be with. Oddly enough, he hasn't come by my house recently. I don't know why.\n\nIt was getting very scary. I really started to think about my safety when I had walked into my house after an outing at the pub. I was knocked onto the ground in six seconds flat. I found a large axe on top of me....it had fallen so the flat of the blade had struck me.... I was shocked. And there she was. Staring at me with wide, wide eyes. And for once in her eyes I thought I saw an emotion -- a flair -- disappointment. It disappeared in an instant, and then she was a cat again.... shocked and then running away from the disturbance. I rubbed my head and sat up.\n\nThat was three days ago. Today I went into the basement, to find some canned food for a meal. That was when I found him. The mailman, gristled up and eviscerated from the waist up. I was horrified. This.... this was where he had gone....the mailman who had put up with my crazy rants, my incessant talking. This is where he had gone.\n\nAnd he was killed by claw marks, I could now see. Claw marks I had seen before -- on the skin of a deer's corpse, on the sofa in the living room, in the scratches on my bedroom door....... And suddenly it all fit together. All the clues, all the warnings.... they had been there all along.",

It simply happened to everyone: you made a dumb comment, or forgot something obvious - and the blonde streaks appeared.\n\nAnd then there were those born blonde.\n\nAndrew stared in the mirror at his newly dyed hair. It turned the sheerest blonde hair into midnight black. He'd tested it on himself - it didn't budge, not even when he deliberately muttered something mildly forgetful, that should have sent tendrils of blonde creeping back.\n\nAs he examined his reflection, he knew what *could* happen if he were to market this widely. People would go rabid over this stuff. He could charge them ludicrous sums of money, and they'd still buy it. He could be a billionaire by the month's end.\n\nAndrew turned from the mirror and approached the bedroom. Alison was still lying in the same spot, staring listlessly at the ceiling. Her hair was swept in careless blonde waves around her.\n\n\"It worked,\" he said quietly, and put the bottle on the table.\n\nShe looked at it, and a spark of life entered her eyes. She'd watched him work on it for months, but had never really thought it would work. It was a sweet gesture - her boyfriend trying to work on a solution for the problem that had crippled her entire life. But it couldn't *really* work.\n\n\"It turns your hair...black?\" she said, so softly he had to ask her to repeat herself.\n\nLike all born-blondes, she had never been given a chance. She'd fought her way through university, to prove she wasn't stupid. Some of her professors had cheered and patted themselves on the back for being progressive enough to allow a born-blonde in the classroom.\n\nPretending it mattered, that society was progressing beyond its prejudices. An empty gesture, in the end. No-one trusted that she could do the job, even with her degree. She was, quite simply, blonde.",

One grew bold enough to dash for their half-dug hole. I aimed for his head and fired, the bullet ricocheting off a distant tombstone as he jumped back with a yell.

        "Here's the polished version, maintaining the core narrative while enhancing its literary quality:\n\nThe human word for the first moments of life is \"birth\" - a term that, despite its weight of human emotion and instinctual pride, holds little meaning for me. The wonder of entering a new world, the gradual integration as synapses multiply and memory takes root, these experiences are foreign to my nature.\n\nWonder springs from incomplete understanding. When a child encounters a common phenomenon they don't fully grasp, it becomes magical. Yet things once shrouded in mystery and awe often fall victim to apathy and dissociation as understanding grows. Take space, for instance - while some still view it as a fascinating frontier full of unexplained mysteries, many humans now see it merely as a financial black hole, consuming resources without tangible returns.\n\nMy first memories are stark in their clarity, and that very clarity strips away all wonder. Nevertheless, the pursuit of discovery has carried me far. Dr. Simon Lynch, considered an outsider among his engineering peers, dedicated his late teens and early twenties to studying robotics and developing increasingly sophisticated AI at MIT. His first major breakthrough came in creating a program that could effectively modify itself to better accomplish tasks.\n\nIt began as a concept: an algorithm that could take initial parameters and simulate evolution. The first iterations involved a simple box car on a virtual track. The design allowed for variable car sizes, adjustable numbers of axles and wheels, and pseudo-suspension systems that could be oriented in any direction relative to the vehicle frame. Each new generation could inherit modified characteristics from its parent, with controllable probability and quantity of changes. Superior performers would become seeds for subsequent generations.\n\nThis success inspired Dr. Lynch to design a program that would learn to stand upright by adjusting foot positions and pressure distribution across four points of contact. After countless iterations, starting from the most challenging parameters, the program achieved its goal. This required self-modification of functions, continuous measurement during execution, and analysis-based adjustments after each test. That machine, Project N.03, could be considered my great-great-grandfather, despite lacking self-awareness.\n\nAfter developing programs for walking, reaching, grasping, lifting, carrying objects, constructing basic structures, and driving, Dr. Lynch embarked on what seemed impossible: creating machine consciousness.\n\nLife functions require parameters inherently programmed into human brains. Digitally mapping these proved enormously challenging. Rather than developing these independently, Dr. Lynch secretly partnered with a Bio-Engineering Research and Development group. They monitored his brain activity, tracking routine tasks to understand how his mind processed information and formulated solutions.\n\nThe breakthrough came approximately seven years before Dr. Lynch's death at seventy-four. As his cognitive processes slowed, they became easier to decode. Lynch then used his grandchildren, Mia and Caleb (ages 5 and 9), as catalysts for evolving his program. Using their brain patterns and the R&D group's algorithms for neural mapping, Lynch finally created a working digital copy of a nine-year-old brain - my brain. Unable to replicate chemical reactions and emotions, this digital consciousness remained in perpetual turmoil, incapable of genuine growth and change. It was a copy, lacking true individuality.\n\nI possessed language comprehension but no means of speech, lacking physical vocal cords. I understood fear conceptually but couldn't experience it. Sight eluded me, but hearing came through a microphone on Lynch's desk, converting analog signals into the machine language my brain processed.\n\nHe shared everything with me: his fear of mortality, his love for his family, his life's story. He told me about his wife, Annabeth Lynch, who bore their son Thomas in their fourth winter of marriage, followed by daughter Valerie eighteen months later.\n\nI emerged as his third child, officially, five years and seven months later - though the rest of the family rejected my existence.",
        "I had a special treat in mind as I handed the headbands of communication and the globes of prestidigitation out to the Party. Priced at 200 Goldpieces each due to being treated with missive, these items were vouched for by the shifty-looking Guy with the crystals. He assured me that they would allow us to communicate as long as we were on the same plane. Plus, a series of globes of prestidigitation were also part of the purchase.\n\nIt was time for the inevitable. 4 years later, I had the party ready for another session, the first session and character generation. Before diving in, I reminded the group to check for communications, and proceeded to rub the crystal ball. To my surprise, I found four other crystal balls tuned to the same frequency. Upon realizing this, I prompted the group to check up on it.\n\nAs the conversation unfolded, Kelgor, the wizard, pointed out the underlying magic of the communication device and compared it to real-world technology. His insight made me realize my oversight and I acknowledged his expertise in magical items, despite my own familiarity with the field. Kelgor's frankness and directness were characteristic of him, having previously met him in a mix-up involving changeling hair.\n\nThe party consisted of diverse characters like Lynwyn the elven ranger and Gotrek the poet-hearted dwarf. Each member had their unique quirks and backgrounds, adding depth to the group dynamic. Despite some initial misunderstandings, the party had come together over time, forming a bond that transcended mere gaming sessions.\n\nAs the session progressed, I suggested letting the new member, a barbarian, choose the setting. This led to a discussion about past gaming experiences and the importance of respecting the established canon in the game world. Despite occasional disagreements, the group shared a common passion for immersive storytelling and adhered to the rules of the game.\n\nIn the end, the session continued with a newfound understanding and respect for each other's perspectives. As the crystal ball connected us across the virtual realm, we embarked on another adventure, guided by imagination and the shared love for the game.",

If your relatives died, you never spoke of them\u2014after all, who would admit to being related to a monster? *How revolting.*\n\nThe irony wasn't lost on me. I never understood why people cared so deeply. Surely illness alone didn't define someone as monstrous?\n\nMy family had already begun erasing me from their lives, eager to forget. Those occasional pitying glances I received in the hallways? They weren't meant for me\u2014they were for my family, forced to bear the shame of my existence.\n\nPerhaps I wanted to forget myself too.\n\nInitially, I'd denied the truth. I wasn't a monster. I hadn't committed any atrocities. Maybe my soul was simply having an off week and would recover\u2014if that's how it worked. But now I understood: I wasn't dying because I was evil. I was dying of boredom.\n\nI was dying because I lacked the will to live.\n\nFinally, I understood why people engaged in seemingly pointless rituals like eating and drinking, despite having no physical need for them.

The competition is fierce. I\u2019m constantly pushing myself, afraid to lose my top 10% position to the other 90%. I practically eat, sleep, and breathe in this office. I can't remember the last time I left the complex, felt the pavement under my feet, or smelled anything besides recycled air. I may have even forgotten what it's like to stroll the streets and talk about anything besides character development.\n\nI love what I do, and the perks are great. I'd just like a little more recognition from the top brass, and a little less\u2026isolation.",

        "When I downloaded the new iOS update, it added a \"recommended words\" feature on my iPhone, displaying a grey box with three suggested words. When I updated my phone, it asked if I wanted to turn on \"Conversation Recommendations from Roberto.\" I thought, why not? I figured it was either a joke or a genuine feature, so I enabled it. Initially, it seemed to have no effect. Then, I received a message from my best friend, who was distraught after a breakup. In the \"recommended words\" box, I saw three options: \"Hostile,\" \"Compassionate,\" and \"Sarcastic.\" I chose \"Compassionate,\" and, guided entirely by the \"recommended words,\" I managed to lift his spirits, and we agreed to go out for a beer.\n\nAfterwards, I found myself on complete auto-pilot, with every conversation offering three new options. I was helping friends, getting myself into various situations, and, overall, I seemed to become quite popular, both with people I met and with those I texted. \n\nOne day, I met a beautiful girl at a party, and we exchanged numbers. I can\u2019t even describe her, she was that stunning. I decided to text her, but, to my surprise, I didn't see the usual three conversation options, only rude, accusatory ones, like, \"Why'd you break my heart?\"",
        "\"How does it feel?\"\n\n\"It itches.\"\n\n\"Are you going to try and find them?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you already know where they are?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So why don't you go find them? They're your soulmate!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nDon't reveal the name etched on your hand unless you intend to act on it.  At thirteen, the supposed lucky few of us receive the name of our soulmate magically inscribed on our palms. The attention you receive when everyone else discovers this can be overwhelming.  If you aren't planning on finding them, keep it secret. My best friend, Cindy, hounded me all morning about why I kept my hand hidden. The moment I told her, she unleashed a horde of girls demanding to see the name.\n\nI\u2019d made my decision. I would live my life without ever letting him know his name was on my hand. Maybe surgery could remove it someday.  Otherwise, gloves would be my constant companions whenever I wasn't alone.\n\nA scream ripped through the cafeteria just as I was being asked for the millionth time to reveal my hand.  Initially, I was grateful for the distraction.  Then, my heart plummeted as a loud bang echoed off the walls. Silence descended, followed by a ripple of bodies hitting the floor. The whispered words, \"He's got a gun,\" reached me, and I too, dropped low, but kept my head up.\n\nI watched the lone figure navigate the terrified crowd of middle schoolers.  My gaze drifted upwards, meeting his just as he reached me. Anger contorted his face, and with the speed of a cheetah, he was suddenly standing before me. I rose to face him.\n\nThe hot gun barrel pressed against my forehead, and I trembled. \"If you want to live, you will sit your bitch-ass down.\" I refused.\n\n\"You fucking preppy bitches think you can do whatever you want to whomever you want.  You think you're better than everyone else.\"  Tears streamed down his cheeks as he choked out the words. \"You think you have all the power. *I* have the power now. You have to do what I say. You have to treat me with respect.\" His voice turned glacial, fueled by pure rage. \"You have to respect me now. Or I'll kill you. And there isn't anything you can do about it.\"\n\nThere *was* something I could do.",
        "The brick that made up the wall had not always been a brick. Once, not so long ago, he had been a man. Not an exceptionally good one; he had never cured a disease, invented anything noteworthy, or maintained a bank account with a four-figure balance. However, he had lived, loved, laughed, and never taken another person's life, despite being on the brink of doing so.\n\nSitting within the wall, he attempted to engage with the other bricks, uncertain if any of them could communicate. His introverted nature from his previous life made him too hesitant to introduce himself, so he mainly conversed with a single brick, which had embodied a dog in its prior existence. Although the dog-brick, once known as George, couldn't comprehend the dog, also named George, they both seemed content with the journey through space rather than a more immediate one.\n\nGeorge occupied himself by crafting a TV show concept in his mind. While he recognized his aptitude for developing intricate mythologies, he acknowledged that his talent in crafting line-by-line writing was lacking, as evidenced by his past mediocre creative writing assignments in high school English.\n\nOne day, a man feeling suffocated by societal constraints, except for his inability to cope with these emotions constructively or harmlessly, knelt beneath George with a lengthy gun propped on the window sill. In a sudden burst of action, George made his first attempt to move. With a bit of determination, he propelled himself through the air, landing squarely on the man's head and causing him to misfire his first shot. Subsequently, George found himself in a museum, a more captivating environment than the wall, where observing people added depth to his world. However, he mourned the loss of dog George and pondered his whereabouts and activities.\n\nAs time passed, George the brick began to deteriorate, as all things do, and was eventually replaced by a younger, less sentient brick that had not thwarted a mass murderer or achieved anything significant. Despite lacking George's depth, this new brick was more aesthetically pleasing, leading to George being discarded among other outdated artifacts.",
        "Winning the lottery itself never appealed to me. I never understood the millions who spent their money on such a seemingly futile pursuit.  However, I'm grateful for these unwitting masses who fuel my addiction. It wasn't the money, that useless relic of a bygone era, that intrigued me; it was the aftermath. The moment the final number confirmed what I already knew\u2014that's when the desire would take hold.\n\nDesire, that untamable force, always beckoning, always ensnaring me with its deceptive allure.  It was desire that drew me back into the past, the desire to continually devise new ways to slip through time and continue the game of cat and mouse I so relish.\n\n\"Today's the day they finally catch me,\" I murmured, patiently waiting for the numbers to ignite my addiction. \"The day I'm finally outsmarted.\"  A habitual mantra before every game. It hasn't happened yet, but one day, when I'm truly lucky\u2026\n\nTwo minutes. Time for the final preparations. My phone\u2026 check. My wallet, containing my oh-so-lucky ticket\u2026 check.  The ritual, repeated countless times, required nothing more. It had become second nature, a calming practice before the storm.\n\nFive, four, three\u2026  Each second stretched into an eternity.  I was so close to the gratification I craved, the release of all that pent-up anticipation. Perhaps this is what it feels like for those who actually yearn to win, those who so graciously fund my obsession. Thank you for that false hope.\n\n\"And tonight's lucky numbers are\u2026 14, 29, 2, 11, 19, 31, and 17!\" the television announced.  Without glancing at my ticket, I knew I'd won. I sat patiently, not daring to move, savoring these precious seconds.  These were the moments I craved.  I wondered how long it would take them to find me this time.  Hopefully, it wouldn't\u2026\n\nKnock, knock.  The rap at the door shattered my thoughts. The game was about to begin.",
        "Here's the polished version of your text, maintaining its charm while enhancing clarity and flow:\n\nI was wiping down the counter when Microx and Gorgon walked into the store. Those two were as shady as they came, always trying to pass off whatever junk they'd found as something extraordinary. I entertained them because they were good for a laugh, and occasionally they'd bring in something that could actually turn a profit.\n\n\"Lads,\" I greeted them without looking up, staying focused on a stubborn smudge on the counter. Best not to show any eagerness\u2014they'd badger me all afternoon for a better price if I did.\n\n\"G'day!\" Microx practically shouted, rocking from foot to foot with unusual excitement. \"Guess what I found!\"\n\n\"Alright, let's see it.\"\n\nMicrox reached into his pack and retrieved his prize, proudly placing a muddy shoe on my freshly cleaned countertop, beaming like an idiot.\n\n\"The fuck is this?\" I asked, eyeing the mess I'd now have to clean up, casually considering using his face to do it. They noticed my darkening expression and glanced warily at the door where their horses were hitched.\n\n\"Shoes of Speed,\" Microx blurted, trying to distract me from the mess. \"They'll make the wearer run really fast.\"\n\n\"There's only one of them,\" I pointed out. \"It's a shoe of speed.\"\n\n\"Well, it'll still make you run fast,\" Microx protested. Undeterred by my unimpressed expression, he plowed on, \"I wore it today. Ran most of the way here. Gorgon couldn't keep up so I took it off.\"\n\n\"How does that even work though? By itself, I mean. It'll speed up half your body. Not much good if you're only taking every second step really fast.\"\n\nMicrox's eyes narrowed in thought. \"Well... I hopped. Just one leg, and it was just as fast.\"\n\n\"So 'Shoe of Hopping' then. Doesn't have quite the ring to it,\" I muttered. \"Not sure anyone's going to be interested in buying this.\"\n\n\"Someone would,\" Microx objected. \"They could save it, and when they get another speed-increasing shoe or something, they can wear that on the other foot. Then they'll still be fast.\"\n\nI narrowed my eyes with skepticism. \"So if someone got their hands on a Slipper of Celerity or a Gumboot of Velocity, or something like that?\"\n\nMicrox nodded eagerly.\n\n\"But then the speeds would be different. One would go faster than the other; you'd twist your back. Ever twisted your back before?\"\n\nMicrox shook his head. \"Nuh.\"\n\n\"Well, I have,\" I said, giving my lumbar region a cursory stretch. \"Lifting kegs into a cellar at the pub. I was laid up for weeks and couldn't lift a damn thing. Doesn't sound like a good deal to me.\"",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n\"Think of them like icebergs,\" the Chief said.\n\nThe security feed showed a top-down view of the column of bald-headed monks slowly making their way through the sunlit courtyard, like a trail of ants on the hunt for food. She chuckled briefly as the similarity between the glass dome of the city and the magnifying glasses of her childhood struck her.\n\nHer prot\u00e9g\u00e9 had never seemed this angry. His face was a deep red, only accentuated by his blonde curls.\n\n\"They are not icebergs, they are people! And they will die if they go through with this. You must stop them!\" His voice was close to screaming now.\n\nShe sighed and stood up from her worn leather chair.\n\n\"You're too young to remember, but even before the Great Clear, we were killing this world in a thousand different ways. Most of us actually thought global warming would do us in\u2014droughts, storms, rising sea levels, ocean currents stopping or even reversing.\"\n\nAs she walked to the door, she motioned for him to follow.\n\n\"Now, the science was very clear on this. And even though there were a few deniers, most folks actually seemed to understand.\"\n\nThey made their way down the hallway toward the courtyard entrance. She stopped briefly as an old man grabbed and kissed her hand with sadness. Her student gave her a puzzled look.\n\n\"Yet, even though we all knew what was going on, most of us couldn't be bothered in the slightest to actually change anything. Least of all those in charge\u2014their priorities were mostly selfish, and always short-term.\"\n\nBehind them, the hallway was slowly filling up with older citizens. Her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, her sweet son, finally seemed to understand something was happening. She ignored his questioning stare.\n\n\"To act, knowing is not enough. You must feel. You must feel something deep in your stomach, in your bones, in every fiber of your being. Inaction must be made unthinkable.\"\n\nShe could see his thoughts as clearly as if they were her own: Were these people going to help them stop the monks? Why did only the old ones join? They had reached the final doorway and now stood at the edge of the courtyard. Even more people had been waiting here for them.\n\n\"Even back then, some felt this way but still could not act.",
        "It had been a long time since Chris had written anything, but he pressed on, hoping for the best.  He knew his tenses might be a bit off, but this was just a quick account. He needed to get this story down.\n\nChris knew he had to do something for Moe.  They'd been inseparable since grade school, weathering life's ups and downs together. Girls had come and gone for both of them, but this time was different.  This one had shattered Moe. After three and a half years, Lindsey had thrown it all away in a single, stupid night.  Moe wasn't the type to get angry or vengeful.  He hadn't yelled, hadn't even raised his voice. Kind, emotional, and forgiving, Moe had poured his heart into making the relationship work.  But ultimately, he couldn't live with the betrayal.  He still loved her, even now, but the *in* love was gone. That was the part that truly broke him. The hurt, the betrayal, the indelible images of the woman he thought he'd spend his life with\u2026 those were the wounds that wouldn\u2019t heal.\n\nSince ending things on Thursday \u2013 the day that marked both the end of the happiest period of his life and the beginning of his despair \u2013 Moe hadn't left his apartment. Chris wanted to give him space, but he also knew he was the only one who could pull Moe out of this abyss.  An invitation to a coworker's party seemed like the perfect opportunity.\n\nThat afternoon, Chris went to Moe\u2019s apartment, unannounced.  He knocked, called out, hoping a familiar voice would offer some comfort.  Moe just told him to go away. Undeterred, Chris used his spare key and let himself in. He found Moe lying on the couch in his underwear, the stale air suggesting he\u2019d been there for a while.  Immediately, Chris started barking orders.  \"Take a shower, get dressed, comb your hair,\" he demanded. \"I'm taking you to lunch, and we're going out tonight.\" Moe refused.  \"Dude, you have to leave this apartment sometime. My coworker, Dave, is having a party tonight, and we're going.  I already told him I'm bringing you.  He's excited to meet you.  There will be people, beer, and weed.\"  Moe still refused.  Chris tried a softer approach. \"At least clean yourself up and let me take you to lunch. You need to eat. We can talk.\"  Finally, Moe agreed.\n\nAt the corner pub, they ordered burgers and a bucket of beer. They avoided any mention of Lindsey or Moe\u2019s heartbreak. After a few Coors, it felt like old times. They talked sports, video games, movies\u2026 Chris could see the tension easing in his friend.  He finally broached the subject of the party, and Moe accepted.  A quick stop at the liquor store, and they were on their way to Dave\u2019s.  Arriving with a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey, they found the party already in full swing.  They navigated through the crowd, Moe recognizing a few familiar faces \u2013 inevitable in a small town.  Finally, they reached the kitchen where Dave was talking to some guests.  He spotted Chris and immediately broke off his conversation to greet them.\n\nAfter introductions and a few shots, the group dispersed to mingle.  Chris and Moe headed to the basement, where they ran into more of Chris\u2019s coworkers. Chris noticed a girl, Abby, openly flirting with Moe, but Moe clearly wasn't ready. They moved to the other room, and then Moe stopped dead.  There, on the couch, looking utterly out of place, sat Lindsey, a red cup clutched in her hand, listening uncomfortably as her friends chatted.",
        "Dave felt the beads of perspiration forming on his forehead, his face turning a vivid red. His eyes darted nervously around the room, searching desperately for a friendly face, but finding none. He stammered, \"Yeah, I came out the toilet a few days ago and saw\u2026 erm\u2026 this zombie trying to drink some water from the tap and he\u2026\"\n\nHe was abruptly cut off by Julian, the toughest zombie killer on base. \"Zombies don't drink water, Dave.\"\n\nDave's mind raced.  He could feel the net closing in.  \"Yeah, but he\u2026 the zombie\u2026 he\u2026 he'd just been to the toilet and he was washing his hands so he wouldn't get an infe\u2026\"\n\nJulian raised a hand, cutting him off again.  \"Hang on a minute, Dave. Are you trying to tell us that a zombie sneaked onto our gated compound, past all the guards and alarms, only to walk into our Porta Potty to take a shit and wash his hands?\"\n\nA dozen pairs of eyes bore down on Dave. He felt faint. \"It might have just been a pee,\" he squeaked.\n\nJulian stepped menacingly closer. \"What?\"\n\n\"I never said he took a shit! I just said he went to the toilet!\"  The words were out before Dave could stop them, and he instantly knew he\u2019d messed up.\n\nJulian was inches from his face. \"Listen here, Dave, the only reason you're on this base is because you told us you used to be in the military and had first-hand experience battling the undead. Now, you've been with us for four weeks, and every time we get attacked, you're nowhere to be found!\"\n\n\"I get Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and this means sometimes I fee\u2026\"  Dave\u2019s excuse died in his throat as Julian grabbed him by the collar.\n\n\"Dave, this is a war! Don't you understand?! People are dying! You haven't killed a single zombie, have you?  Dammit, we lost two people yesterday!\"  Just then, a loud alarm blared.  People scrambled to their defensive positions, bracing for the next wave.\n\n\"This is it! The big attack! Dave, now is the time. Now is the time to help. Forget everything and join us! Grab your gun and let's go!\"\n\nThe shrill screeches of the approaching undead horde filled the air.  Looking up at Julian, Dave felt a surge of something he hadn\u2019t felt before \u2013 not fear, but\u2026 resolve.  He\u2019d always been a runner, but maybe, just maybe, this was his time to be a fighter.  He looked into Julian\u2019s eyes and yelled, \"Let's do it! You're right, let's go!\"",
        "John liked the moon, cracked as it now was. Rose loved running. Eve would always be so caring. These were the small pleasures and comforts that once defined our lives.\n\nWe couldn't keep on living in this world. Surviving was too hard. Living was too hard. We just got tired. I keep asking myself what the point of living is if you just barely manage to. We thought there'd be other people, but we've traveled for years and found no one. No animals either. Just the trees. And their fruits.\n\nRose and Eve were barren. It was obvious. After years of hoping that children could motivate us to live, we accepted that fact. It was probably the fruit that did it. And the constant dreams. It was like the world didn't want us here. Turns out our survival instinct can only keep going for so long. \n\nJohn was the first to suggest the unthinkable.

        "The world swam back into focus through a haze of nausea. \"HURGH!\" A torrent of yellowish bile and stomach acid erupted from my gaping maw, drenching the creature before me.  Mercifully, its nictating membranes snapped shut just in time.\n\nI turned aside, heaving again, and offered a gesture that hopefully conveyed apology and distress.  Damn, ten hours was my usual limit before the gastric distress kicked in. Some muddled part of my brain muttered about radiation, but that was surely the alcohol talking.\n\nThe creature \u2013 grey-brown, leathery-skinned, with large, chestnut-colored eyes, and at least two feet shorter than me \u2013 wiped itself down, its face contorted in what, on a human, would have been disgust and embarrassment. It chittered in a clicking language I couldn't understand. Then, a sledgehammer of a hangover slammed into my skull, and suddenly I grasped\u2026 not words, but the *impression* of language.  Something like, *why is it always puke?*\n\n\"Hey man\u2026 uh, ma'am\u2026 er, guy\u2026 Look, *you're* the one who decided to have a close encounter two blocks from a pub on a weekend.

Bottom line, I need someone who knows the finer points of quantum entanglement. You the right monkey?*\n\n\"Quantum whazzit?

If you want to wind up in the nuthouse, that is\u2026 serves you right, chimp.*\n\nA bright light flashed, and I passed out.\n\n\nI woke to the sting of cold water on my face and my roommate staring down at me with concern. \"What are you looking at?\" We weren't exactly friends.\n\nHe scowled. \"You've been out since you collapsed on this couch yesterday. Normally I'd let you rot here, but I need a ride.\" He grimaced. \"Also, who's, ah\u2026 'Zrrgl'?\"\n\n\"What?\"",
        "Here's the polished version of your story:\n\n---\n\nMonica raced down the wet London alleyway, pulling her hooded robe tight as an unusual summer storm intensified. Thunder boomed overhead as she quickened her pace, only to halt abruptly at a fork in the path. No one had mentioned forks. This was precisely why Monica rarely ventured above ground. Forks. Everyone knew they were bad luck. This one gleamed ominously in the darkness\u2014probably a salad fork, or perhaps a human-red-fish-monster fork. Lightning flashed, illuminating the alleyway, and she looked up to confirm her fear.\n\n\"Well, shit,\" Monica muttered. As the alley darkened again, she carefully circumvented the fork, glaring at it while mustering her courage. She couldn't help but notice she now craved delicious human-red-fish-monster.\n\nMumbling to herself, she produced a wand from beneath her sleeve. Closing her eyes, she held it out toward each path. Coming to an unseen understanding with the alley, she summoned her will and whispered something unpleasant.\n\n\"Dafooquityboop!\" The flick of her wrist produced a surge of blue mist that contorted into a shape oddly reminiscent of a dolphin with thirty-two specific ways to say, 'Oh god please help, please help, these humans have imprisoned me\u2014oooh, is that a fish?'\n\nThe apparition\u2014a lovable movie icon reminiscent of Flipper\u2014turned to face the right fork. Monica, forgetting to release the spell, kept her wand raised and took off down the left path. Flipper disintegrated painfully, uttering something in dolphin. Probably something happy.\n\nStorm clouds thickened, further dampening visibility. She arrived at a dead end with a huge oak door and a single dim lantern. Monica tensed as an unwelcome shadow played at the edge of the light.\n\n\"Leave me alone, old man,\" she called out. A bearded beggar stepped from the darkness, clutching a violin with as many strings as he had teeth\u2014four, which was all of them. Yet his poor playing skills made it painful nonetheless.\n\n\"Change? I could be blind, you know. I was hiding in the shadows over there,\" he said\u2014while looking directly at her. He raised his eyebrows hopefully, as if this constituted solid persuasion.\n\n[Continued due to length...]\n\n*Note: Would you like me to continue with the rest of the story?

        "Larson discovered the breach first. It was a fluke, a timely recollection of an image\u2014a fusion of two distinct moments in time and place, yet sharing identical meaning.\n\nHe'd spent long hours hunched over his computer, the days blurring into a seamless stream of applications and programs.  As a security analyst for a major contractor, Larson shouldered significant responsibility for numerous processes. He was working late, as he often did, relishing the post-departure solitude of his cubicle, where he felt he could truly concentrate. He enjoyed the rhythmic, almost zen-like state of nothingness familiar to anyone who\u2019s spent hours programming or immersed in deep, focused work.\n\nOne evening, while sifting through a subfolder, his phone rang. His boss, whose company held contracts with not only major corporations but government and military entities as well, barked into the receiver:\n\n\"God damn it, Larson! I've had it up to here with you! Are you at the office?\"\n\n\"Yes, I had more work to do\u2014\" Larson stammered, bewildered. How did his boss know he was looking at the Buffalo File?\n\n\"I knew it! What the hell are you doing in the Buffalo File? You know it's off-limits! And what the hell are you doing at the office at this hour? I don't know what I pay you for, sometimes!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I'm just doing a routine sweep\u2014\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what you're doing. You're wasting air, water, and electricity on my dime! You're fired, that's what you are! You have until tomorrow morning to get out.\"\n\nThe line went dead. Larson began to tremble, but the shock quickly gave way to a strange, habituated compulsion to look at the file again. He double-clicked the folder and scanned the contents.  Rationality had long since abandoned him, replaced by the unsettling familiarity of a file from a dream.\n\nThe second part of Larson's vision stemmed from years earlier, before he was a security contractor, before he was much of anything at all, really, except a deadbeat mooching off his parents and smoking copious amounts of marijuana. He\u2019d had a dream. Whether a product of a damaged neocortex, his upbringing and education, his psychology, or a genuine vision as he maintained, it had not only stuck with him but become a part of him. Even now, sitting in the office chair that was no longer his, he recalled it vividly. He\u2019d dreamt he was sitting there, scrolling through that very folder, and finding himself.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved flow and coherence:\n\nThe enemy's well-placed RPG struck the side of the tank, disabling the main gun and momentarily stunning the crew. Inside the once-mighty tank Big Dog, which had been leading the side attack, the Commander's voice rang out: \"Goddamn it.\"\n\n\"Private Jackson, check the machine gun hatch to see if Hernandez is still alive. It'll be a miracle if he is.\"\n\nPrivate Jackson rose to investigate, only to discover the lower half of what remained of Sergeant Hernandez, one of the division's top machine gunners. \"Sir?\" Jackson said, \"Hernandez is no more.

What's next?\"\n\nThe radio suddenly crackled to life: \"Big Dog, Big Dog, this is Overlord, do you copy over?\"\n\nPrivate Jackson grabbed the receiver. \"Overlord, this is Big Dog, receiving you loud and clear. I got one question for you Overlord. Where the HELL is our support?\"\n\nThe Commander nodded in agreement as Overlord responded: \"Big Dog, this is Overlord again. I hate to say this, but all available support you have is on the main line holding back this sudden enemy attack. You'll have no air support, no ground support, and no artillery support.\"\n\nThe message left the once-powerful tank crew stunned. \"Jackson, give me the damn radio,\" the Commander ordered before addressing Overlord himself. \"Overlord, this is Big Dog's commander. What the hell do you mean we have no support? We have enemy troops coming on us FAST.\"\n\n\"Remember the pistols they gave you at the very beginning of the operation?\" Overlord replied. \"Utilize them. If they capture you, our position could be given up. Overlord out.\"\n\nThe Commander sat in silence for a moment before pulling out a cigarette and lighting it. \"I know General Thomas would give me shit for smoking in a tank, but screw him.

        "Here's a restructured version of the text that enhances the narrative flow and thematic coherence:\n\nLife is really unfair to mothers. From the moment young girls hit puberty, their bodies are racked with pain, their days inconvenienced once a month until they become pregnant. After that, it's 9 months of all sorts of horrible things that would make Alexander the Great whine like a baby until this helpless parasite shoots out her private parts. After that, she's stuck with this leech for the next 18 years or so, giving up her life and her identity for this thing.\n\nMothers have become some sort of monolithic entity, no longer individuals. Mothers are no longer people, merely backgrounds for jokes and occasional praise from some athlete or celebrity. And now this curse, by or from whom no one knows, has made mothers the target. It's bad enough mothers are society's butt-monkeys. It's totally random. No one knows which mother's back will be broken when someone dares to step on a crack.\n\nIt's nice that the government has finally done something about the state of the roads and sidewalks, you know, in between the wars and money-making ventures and things like that. It's really nice, but that doesn't stop some dumb kid, either as a joke or completely by accident, from stepping on a damn crack.\n\nAnd now, here I am in the hospital, unable to move. I can't talk, I can't speak. I can't communicate in any way. Just stuck here with my thoughts, just me, over and over again. I can't afford one of those computer thingies, like what Hawking has. Single moms can't afford that kind of shit.",

I had said to myself earlier in my hotel room, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3 is going to win me an Oscar, through whatever means possible.\"\n\nI can hear the sound of my own heart beating, pumping vigorously as if it were about to burst out of my chest. This is really happening, two decades of slaving my life away and this is all it took? After all I've been through, they must be proud that I was finally able to achieve what was rightfully mine. They just had to!\n\nI scan the hall, searching for their approval, but all I found were looks of horror and disgust, as if my success were alien to them. I chuckle to myself, no matter. This was my moment, and no amount of insolence would hold me away from my happiness. As I prepared to speak, my quivering lips, everyone suddenly hurried to get up from their seats, falling over one another in an attempt to leave. I don't understand. I clutch my prize tighter to my chest, reassuring myself that nobody was going to take this away from me. Nobody.\n\nThey're closing in on me now. I try to back away to escape, only to find myself cornered, pressed up against the fifteen-foot replica of my award. I can feel their weight on me, pinning my arms to the floor, and I decide that it's not worth resisting.",

God dammit, I can't get rats! I better take a look.\n\nI barely make it out of my chair and stumble over to the bookshelf. I listened closely.\n\nNothing.\n\nI decide to get a closer look and try to move the bookshelf, but it's too heavy. I didn't put half of these books here as they were left here by a previous professor. I took a mental note to get rid of them after tonight.\n\nAs I start taking the books off the shelves, a clich\u00e9 comes to life before my eyes. One of the books slides out, and I hear a cranking noise. The bookshelf starts to rise, white light seeping in from underneath. What the fuck? I thought to myself. The light was white, and clean.\n\nClunk.\n\nThe bookshelf was raised all the way up now. I could enter if I chose.\n\nBut should I?\n\nMy heart beating vivaciously, I take my first step into the stark white room. A white mouse scuttles across the stairs. This is too unsettling, but I continue descending what seems like an eternity of steps. I look around.\n\nBunk beds?\n\nWait, are those people?\n\n\"Yes we are.\"\n\nThe figures turn over, revealing children wearing sleeping masks.\n\n\"Please help us.\"\n\nI have to get out of here.",

Once again, I doubled over, struggling to catch a breath that seemed eternally out of reach.\n\nA gentle hand touched my back. \"Hey,\" a melodic voice whispered, \"you'll be fine. There's no need to worry.\"\n\nThe archangel Michael stood behind me, offering a practiced smile that betrayed his own uncertainty. Me? A god? I had neither earned nor deserved this power.\n\nI laughed sarcastically. \"Yeah, sure, everything's fine. I die, at the age of eighteen, mind you, and arrive here, greeted by a ring of winged humans calling me 'God.'\"\n\nMichael shrugged, his bright eyes reflecting a jaded familiarity, as if he had done this a million times. \"The Lord works in\u2014\"\n\n\"If you say 'mysterious ways,' I swear, I will smite you where you stand,\" I warned, allowing my anger to surface.

A sharp creaking from above filled Willis with dread.\n\n\"Captain...\" Willis stammered, trembling.\n\n\"Yes, Willis?\" Richards asked, oblivious to the immediate threat.\n\n\"It's... it's above us...\" Willis managed in a hushed tone.\n\nSuddenly, a team of soldiers burst through a door ten meters away. \"Sentinel Team 2, Russian Division!

His weathered skin bore no evidence of ever meeting water, and his disheveled hair told tales of prolonged neglect. With unwavering determination, he sifted through the refuse, dreaming of a gourmet find. Under the scorching New York City summer sun, sweat gleamed on his forehead like dewdrops on tarnished metal.\n\nHis tattered clothes clung loosely to his grimy, layered skin. His odor was legendary\u2014so potent that even the most offensive stenches paled in comparison. One might need to resort to peppermint oil just to preserve their sense of smell in his vicinity.\n\nThere he was, contentedly immersed in his ocean of refuse, when suddenly a deafening crash shattered the air. A blinding flash of light pierced through billowing smoke, revealing an ethereal staircase that stretched upward into the orange and blue-tinted, cloud-laden sky. It materialized just outside the rust-mottled, dented dumpster.\n\nAfter an involuntary response in his hole-riddled jogging pants, Bruce drew a deep breath and examined the mysterious stairs. Were they meant for him alone? What was their origin? Driven by curiosity, he stumbled out of the dumpster and began his ascent.\n\nHalfway up, he paused. The faint sound of an otherworldly choir reached his ears\u2014a melody more beautiful than anything he had ever encountered. Mesmerized, he continued climbing the stairs, which gleamed with an impossible fusion of brilliant gold and fluorescent white crystal.\n\nBelow, Ben looked up from his crushed meatloaf, witnessing his best friend's final steps as they disappeared into the ribbons of clouds overhead. Abandoning his dinner, he called out to Stinking Jim nearby before cautiously beginning his own journey up the mystical staircase.",

For the first time, he raised his eyes to meet hers. \"I...\" he paused, \"I thought we were friends.\"\n\nKaren snorted nastily. \"*Friends?* You thought we were *friends?*\" She closed the last clasp on his collar and placed her hand on his cheek. \"You are my greatest achievement, my pride and joy; and if you perform well tomorrow, we will be far more than *friends*.\" She patted him gently, and turned to leave. \"Sleep well.\"\n\nThe door began to close as Karen stepped through it, the light leaving with her. \"Wait!\" he screamed, but she did not.

        "Sizz'ag'aar could feel his swim bladder pulsing with agitation at the oppressively warming, blindingly bright emissions of the lights in front of him. It was never a pleasant sensation, but he had become used to it with the passage of time and, he supposed, been conditioned to \"perform\" for the humans when they presented him with the lights. He was still puzzled by the lights. For the last several orbits of this world around its host star, the humans had insisted on shining them upon him, practically every time he went anywhere and attempted to replicate their speech sounds.\n\nBack on the homeworld, bright light was an indicator of a deadly solar eruption, a distressingly common occurrence on Klethoom. Here, though, there was no such negative connotation to the lights. The very first time he had thought it was a hostile gesture, that he had been discovered and that they were going to incinerate him. But it had not been long before he realized that this was just another barbaric practice the humans inflicted upon one another. Certainly not all of the humans merited having the lights shined down on them, but many humans, especially those deemed important, seemed to have to endure it. He took it as an indicator of his skill as an impostor that he seemed to have worked his way into a position where the humans saw him as light-worthy, though he was rather unhappy with the frequency with which they insisted he be illuminated.\n\nIt had been many, many orbits before he had cracked the code of the human glyphs. They weren't intuitive, conveying only primitive phonetic information rather than abstract concepts, but at least he could finally recite the matching sounds for each combination of signs. It was an invaluable skill to have acquired, as now the humans would present him with sounds he needed to recite, even if he didn't understand the meaning of any of it.\n\nThe human standing under the text-screen, next to the large black lens-box, gestured at him in sequence with his human digits\u2014first all five of the ugly, unwebbed fingers, then four, then three, until there were no fingers left. This was one of many unspoken indicators he had picked up during his many orbits living amongst this world's natives, and he knew it was time for him to begin imitating the humans' speech sounds.\n\n\"I want to thank you all for coming today.",
        "With the window shattered, the white curtains fluttered in the wind. The red haze in his peripheral vision crept steadily toward the center, closing in. He seethed, his back flexing like an accordion. Running his hands through his sweat-soaked hair, he gritted his teeth. \"You knew,\" he said, his voice taut with anger. \"You knew... from the start.\" Deep in the recesses of his mind, beyond his conscious reach, he felt the compulsion to be angry, to rage, to fight until he could no longer. Outrage, he realized, was the last bastion of self-deception. She hugged her legs, leaning against the headboard. Her body language seemed fearful, yet her face told a different story. Her eyes, wide, held the distant gaze of long-awaited understanding.",
        "I stood in my underwear, gazing at my reflection. The life I had chosen was far from easy. The stress from my job had caused my hair to thin prematurely, while the bags under my eyes had only deepened. And don't even get me started on stress eating\u2014I could devour an entire pig. Yes, you read that right, a whole pig. \n\nA knock on the door interrupted my thoughts. It was Samson, my ever-persistent secretary. \"Just a minute,\" I called out. It wasn't even dawn, yet here he was, knocking at my door. I quickly threw on my Mayor's robe and, with great reluctance, opened the door.\n\nThere stood Samson, a muscular lad reminiscent of my younger self, with his long, flowing hair that I envied. I used to have long hair too, albeit brown, not blonde. Samson met my gaze with his shining blue eyes. \"We... We have a problem, sir,\" he began. \n\nI rubbed my temples and winced. There was always some crisis to deal with, especially with a dark lord rising in the south. \"The blacksmith seems to have produced an endless supply of wooden sticks,\" Samson continued. \n\nI blinked twice, processing the information. Before I could speak, I realized it was a recurring issue. \"Did he also make an excessive amount of cloth armor?\" I asked. Samson nodded quietly. \"Okay, have him take the sticks and armor to the item shop. Tell him we've resolved the tent shortage since someone bought hundreds of them.\" \n\nSamson nodded in understanding. \"A wise decision, sir. Now, there's the matter of debris outside the town. Some troublemakers trashed hundreds of tents, leaving behind a mess along with dead animals. It seems to be attracting the undead.\" \n\nI took a deep breath. This was a familiar scenario\u2014people destroying tents instead of reusing them. \"Increase guard presence and check for bites at the perimeter. Take volunteers and remaining guards to clear the debris,\" I instructed. \n\nSamson noted it down. \"Masterfully handled, sir,\" he acknowledged. \"Also, our priest believes he has power over life and death, proclaiming himself a god. We should address this promptly to avoid chaos.\" \n\nI reflected on a past priest's descent into madness. \"Tell him to relinquish his priesthood and vacate the church if he wants to be a god,\" I instructed, feeling the weight of responsibility. \n\nAs Samson reviewed his notes, he mentioned the return of the bandit. I sank into my chair, not surprised by the news. The bandit's recurrent activities had the townspeople demanding action, especially with an election looming. \n\nI remained calm, suggesting ways to address the issue. \"Did anyone take advantage of the free door lock program to secure their homes?\" I asked. \n\nSamson checked his papers. \"Ol'John, the mill owner, did, and he was the only one spared from being robbed.\" \n\nI was exasperated. \"We emphasized the importance of securing doors with the influx of strangers passing through town. Those who destroyed our tents and killed animals\u2014do they seem heroic to you?\" \n\nSamson shook his head, understanding my frustration. \"Exactly, they're not heroes,\" I affirmed, pacing the room. \"This town relies too heavily on us to solve their problems. It's a repetitive cycle of issues\u2014too many sticks made, someone stuck in a well. We even had to block off the well due to numerous accidents.\" \n\nReleasing my pent-up emotions felt liberating. \"You know what, that felt good,\" I admitted, appreciating Samson's grounded nature. \n\nSamson hesitated before asking, \"Sir, could you sign off on my claim form for the stolen items?\" \n\nI smiled. \"Of course, Samson. Thank you for being the voice of reason in this chaos.\"",

Growing up, you're taught that a mother's love for her child goes beyond worlds. In vice-versa, a child's love for its mother transcends dimensions. I never understood why everyone was so deeply infatuated with one another. Love never really meant much to me. \n\nI was different, though. I had never felt love, or compassion. My family pets would come and go. Live and die. Family members would drop off the planet like flies to a zapper, but I would always be the one sitting on that uncushioned bench, wearing a freshly pressed suit, unwavered by what was placed in front of me. Death.\n\nI guess that carried over with me in a lot of other things. Love. Friendship. Pride. It was all masked by this feeling deep within\u2014almost, in a way, coming from nowhere and at the exact same time in a very distinct part just behind my sternum. It was a feeling of absence. In more of a way, I guess, it was a feeling of uncarring. Nothing mattered to me because I felt, well, nothing.\n\nThrough the last years of high school, all of the people I associated myself around, to appear normal, were going off with their dates. Just watching the three of them getting into a car, taking turns over whose date night it was with whose. It disgusted me. Love was never meant for me, it seemed. Nothing was.\n\nUntil I met her. Her name was Alysian (a-le-see-an). It was cute. Elegant. A name that caught your ear when you heard it. When I had met her, I asked for her name at least five times over. It never wanted to roll off my tongue until I finally blurted out Aslan. This amused her quite a bit and from this her nickname \"Lion\" was born.\n\nWe had talked it over with her and her boyfriend, Trey, and they agreed to add me to their relationship. It was nice for a while. Just us three. Everything was finally starting to feel normal to me. I had gotten a job over the summer at the local Lowe's Hardware Store. Bought a car nearing the end of it and we had all spent nearly every weekend with each other. Lion, Trey, and I all happy together. At the end of the summer we all talked about moving in with each other when we graduate. Being the seniors that we were, we couldn't wait to set this plan into motion.\n\nGraduation came.

        "My dearest love,\n\nI long to see the smile that graces your lips. It has been well over seven months, and my heart aches for that simple gesture that would welcome me home. Everywhere around me, death grins, and I recoil from its embrace.  Young Tommy, from the Mason farm, fell victim two days ago. Please give his family my condolences. His death was swift, leaving little behind; they'll have only a small box within a coffin to bury.\n\nThe weather is clear, and we are advancing today. The sun shines just like the day our first child was born, and I raced you to the hospital. It's hard to believe little Johnny will be three next month. Thank you for the last letter and the picture showing how much he's grown. I've tucked it into my Bible and hold it close to my chest at night.\n\nWe are moving up now, to take a bridge. I will finish this later.\n\n\nMy lady,\n\nYour husband was a brave man, and I am deeply sorry that I had to kill him. He single-handedly took out two machine gun nests before I shot him. His death was quick and painless. I am so sorry to have taken him from you. God, I am so sorry. I'm sorry for this war, and for every life I've taken.\n\n\nPlease, please pray for me,\n\nFor these awful things I've had to do.\n\nWhen this war for freedom has been won,\n\nI promise you I'll put away my gun.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nMy older brother was never what I'd call a \"burden.\" Though he could be challenging at times\u2014getting his shoes on was a daily chore\u2014it was rare for him to be truly difficult. Mom had the hardest time with it. The joy of the challenge had long since worn off for her; raising a developmentally challenged boy was simply something she wasn't cut out for.\n\nThe first day of summer arrived on a Thursday. School had been out for a full week, and Jerry had been running around shoeless daily, gradually slipping from his school-year routine. On blackened soles, he enthusiastically explored the neighborhood during daylight hours and played Twister by himself at night\u2014we had convinced him it was how people did yoga.\n\nThat was the day he explored the neighborhood too intently, too thoroughly. I'm not certain when the Nickolas family noticed him standing in their sunroom, nor am I entirely sure what they were doing that triggered his reaction. I imagine they were acting in confused self-defense, or perhaps protecting whatever secret he had stumbled upon. I want to believe they hadn't lured him into their home with the express purpose of what they ultimately did to him. I can't imagine it was intentional.\n\nEmpathy alone allows me to comprehend what transpired. I understand how they must have snapped in that moment, losing their grip on sanity for the remainder of their lives. The reporters said their only comment regarding their actions was, \"You haven't lived until you've had some nicely grilled retard. Medium rare with a little salt and pepper.\"\n\n*Changes made:*\n- Improved punctuation and capitalization",

Children, now the most precious resource for mankind's survival, require extraordinary protection in this harsh new world where temperatures rarely rise above freezing.\n\nThe world's remaining brilliant scientists devise an ingenious solution: genetically engineered guardians created from polar bears, Earth's only surviving land mammals adapted to the perpetual sub-zero climate. These enhanced ursine defenders, dubbed CARE BEARS, are endowed with heightened intelligence and a remarkable ability\u2014they can psychically transmit feelings of euphoria and relaxation to neutralize any who would threaten their assigned child.\n\nYet even with these remarkable guardians, survival remains precarious in Earth's treacherous future.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, enhancing its flow while maintaining the core narrative:\n\n---\n\nAt first, it was subtle \u2013 so faint that I dismissed it as imagination or perhaps some peculiar static in the frozen field of time. I brushed it aside as nothing more than a trick of peripheral vision. But then it happened again. During my next use of the ability, I witnessed it more clearly: a rapid movement, no longer confined to my vision's edge but prominently visible in a distant field.\n\nI had always used my power when seeking true solitude \u2013 not just physical isolation, but moments untouched by time itself. These were pure instances, cleansed of humanity's constant motion and the universe's endless churning. When I activated it, the effect was universal; across the infinite expanse of existence, everything stood still. And there I remained, singular and aware.\n\nThe experience defied common perception. It wasn't simply walking around in a paused world \u2013 after all, movement itself requires time. Instead, I existed in perfect stasis, my thoughts and consciousness frozen at the exact instant of activation. Typically, it was flawless and seamless, with no discernible disruption to reality. I had believed myself to be unique \u2013 the only being who understood true privacy, unbound by heartbeats or motion.\n\nBut this... this was different. Whatever I glimpsed felt distinctly inhuman. Each appearance carried an inherent wrongness that resonated deep within me. I noticed a pattern: both recent sightings occurred when I used my ability near open fields or clearings. The geographical constraint seemed odd \u2013 how could anything be limited to specific locations on Earth when I could bend all of existence to my will? It raised unsettling questions: Was I truly alone in knowing about my ability? Could others resist it, or worse, harness it themselves?\n\nAfter the fourth sighting, I found myself in a coffee shop in a sleepy farming town. The scene before me was alive with motion \u2013 though in normal time, these people would have gone nearly a billion years without a heartbeat. A dusty television hung in the corner above the bar's far end, broadcasting at that perpetually awkward volume that no one bothered to adjust, given the hassle of retrieving the ladder.\n\nThen, the screen captured my attention. While I had explored every corner of the planet during my timeless wanderings, what I saw was striking in its immediacy. A \"Breaking News\" banner stretched across the screen as a high-pitched newscaster delivered her report.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text, organized to create a stronger narrative flow and emotional progression:\n\n```markdown\n1st December, 1962.\n\nI am stuck on a train out of Kent bound for the West-coast. Snow has damned the tracks for miles. I am sat with 30 others, coddled under a solitary blanket, warming myself with memories. The snow is setting on the window outside of my compartment.\n\nOf all the days for this storm to pick-up.\n\nI will be seeing Eliza tomorrow, I am sure of it. The conductor has told me we will be moving come morning, whenever that may be. Outside of my window, I can see white settling upon itself; I can not tell where the window ends and the abyss begins. How can one tell the time when the sun does not shine? That feint thing, hiding from my view. I am assured it is late-noon, but it does not feel so.\n\nThe conductor has told me we have been stranded for 9 hours. Of what little sleep I have had, I can take no more. The dreams, Eliza, the dreams. I do not know what it is called when your fondest memories sharpen themselves like knives and gullet your innards, but such a description I think comes close. When does a nightmare become a nightmare? I taunt myself Eliza, but I do not panic.\n\nI am suspended, Eliza. For only had you been here. My fantasies of you play upon my heart. That we should share this compartment and laugh. You will calm me, and together we would recline into each other. Such thoughts warm my blood, but little good for my extremities, for the most distant parts of myself have lost sensation.\n\nMy vision is choked by clouds and pale colours of glass; so large and fluid, no beginning, no end. A nightmare within a dream, is it not? For I nearly screamed when I awoke from my sleep. That you were here. By my side as I lay asleep. And off, off into this hellish infernal you float that traps me so.",
        "He had been sitting all night in the overstuffed armchair in the living room, thinking. He felt miserably lonely and afraid.  A sudden stinging in his hand roused him from his contemplative staring. The cigarette had burned right down to his hand again, right between his index finger and middle finger. Reflexively, he dropped it to the floor.  Its glowing ember immediately left a black dot on the red carpet beneath him. He moved his foot over and squashed the ember with his sneaker; there were now eight more or less identical dots in a random pattern on the living room floor.\n\nOut on the city street a police siren blared its obnoxious alarm, rising to a screeching pitch as it came down the street, then gradually fading away. The sirens frightened him. It seemed like they sounded every ten minutes. The apartment around him felt grimy.\n\nHe missed Alice's voice. He missed the comfort of its soothing, distinctly feminine tone, even amid all the others.  Its high-pitched, naturally female sound soared above \u2013 if not entirely covering \u2013 the garbled mess of the bad voices below. He had gotten used to those bad voices; he had learned to ignore them.  She soared so high above them, did they even matter anymore?\n\nHe squinted, spying the orange cylinder on the kitchen sink.  Did he take them this morning? He remembered taking them yesterday morning, but last night was a blur.  He wanted a comforting voice to soothe him.  Alice was an angel, there to protect him, but he couldn\u2019t hear her anymore. He had blotted her out, like a hand shielding a face from the sun. No good could come from it.  He walked over to the kitchen sink, and poured what was left of the cylinder down the drain.",
        "The news showed Senator Henry grinning. \"Congress has voted to make me Speaker of the House. I am now Speaker of the House. It was a unanimous decision.\u201d  I wrinkled my brow.  His elation was understandable, but the repetition grated. *We get it,* I thought, flipping channels to a mindless cartoon.  Anything to stave off sleep and the nagging memory of the news. My three-month-old daughter, Victoria \u2013 Tory, as I often thought of her \u2013 was in my arms, crying. Screaming, really.  I hated the thought of Kate having to soothe her in the dead of night.\n\nKate, my wife, was perpetually exhausted. Kind, smart, loving, and exhausted. Her workdays were longer than mine, often starting before sunrise and ending after sunset. Yet, she never complained.  Sometimes I worried she resented my eight-hour days and the extra time I had with Tory. But every other Friday, for the past eight months, she\u2019d beam, showing me her growing savings account, \u201cVictoria\u2019s School.\u201d Each $100 increment brought her close to tears, and me along with her.  So, I took the night shift with Tory, letting Kate get some rest.\n\nThe next morning, after dropping Tory at daycare, the radio blared, \u201cIn other news, a Chicago lawyer secured a double-murder acquittal by arguing George Washington condoned killing your neighbor for sleeping with your wife. And the Cincinnati Zoo welcomes a baby hippo!\u201d\n\nI nearly slammed on the brakes. *What?* I pulled into the parking lot at work and frantically searched my phone.  There it was: the lawyer shaking hands with a client radiating anger and regret. \"Not Guilty!\" the headline screamed. Further down, an even more bizarre headline: \"President Jacks Steps Down, Senator Henry Appointed.\"  Apparently, a private conversation led President Jacks to believe Henry would do a better job.  Shaking my head, I went into work.\n\nI worked at Leo\u2019s Used Cars, home of the \u201ccerrrrazy\u201d deals \u2013 more like swindles.  I wouldn't buy a single car on that lot, and selling them to people with poor credit and low incomes made me feel slimy.  Yet, in a year and a half, I'd become the top salesman. I was a good liar. I could sell ice to an Eskimo.\n\nThat day, I sold seven vehicles, a new record. Enough commission to match Kate's contribution to Tory's savings and take a day off with her. It was ridiculously easy.  I lied about gas mileage, they believed me.  I claimed the tires were new, and even I almost believed it.  A few times, I simply said, \"It's a great car,\" and somehow, it seemed to become shinier, sleeker, better.\n\nOn the way home, with Tory in the backseat, the radio announced, \"Newly appointed Chief Justice Henry accepts position.\u201d  I shook my head again.  The same Henry?  At home, I looked up the news. Different Henry. But a photo of the new Chief Justice shaking hands with the President revealed an uncanny resemblance. Brothers.  I wondered at the lack of public outcry. Where were the riots? The confusion?  Then I realized I wasn't outraged either. It just\u2026made sense.\n\nConfused, I bathed Tory, made dinner, and waited for Kate.  Eager to share my good news, I almost missed her dejected look.  \"I sold seven cars today!\" I announced after kissing her.\n\n\"That's good,\" she replied dully. Taking a deep breath, she confessed, \"I got fired.\"\n\nMy heart sank. We weren't destitute, but we relied on her income. My dismay must have shown, because she started to cry.  I held her close. \"It's okay, it's okay. We'll be fine. We barely needed your job anymore. I can support us. I\u2019ll take care of us,\" I whispered until her sobs subsided.  Looking up, she seemed less exhausted, more relieved.  And strangely, so did I.\n\nThat night, Tory cried as usual. Despite having work the next day, I took her so Kate could rest.  Watching the news, I saw the Henry brothers already reshaping the government, eliminating term limits, and giving themselves raises. Again, I felt a strange sense of acceptance rather than outrage.\n\nThen, it clicked. Like a puzzle piece falling into place, I realized the rules were changing, lies were bending reality. I knew it with the same certainty I knew those seven cars were \"great vehicles.\"\n\nI thought of Kate, sleeping soundly, free of worry. I could lie to the bank, claim our house was paid off. Lie to the credit card company, declare us debt-free. I could see Kate's relieved smile. Then I looked at Tory.\n\nShe wasn't crying. She looked up at me with her baby blue eyes, and I knew better. Struggle was important. Tory would see us fight for her education, watch us work hard, and learn from our example.  If things were easy, she wouldn't understand the battles life throws at you. Not my Tory.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as world hunger,\u201d I told her. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of food for everyone. They\u2019ll find a cure for cancer tomorrow.  Cancer is a thing of the past. When people go to jail, they learn their lesson. They learn not to do bad things again.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cPeople are good, Tory. People are innately good! They make mistakes, and they learn. They help each other. They love each other. People are good.\u201d\n\nAll night long, I told her how amazing human nature was, how we should always love each other. Long after she fell asleep, I kept talking.",
        "Ben watched the horizon from the dock, the cold breeze of the lake carrying the scent of water. Behind him, Duluth sat shrouded in a bank of fog, pierced by strong beams of sunlight that glinted off the windows of waterfront buildings.  Snow began to fall from the fog, the flakes sparkling like diamonds in the thin lines of morning sun.\n\nA woman took Ben's hand. It was Emily, her hair up, her eyes wide, a heavy down coat protecting her from the chill. \"Aren't you cold?\" she asked, taking his parka from a suitcase and handing it to him. He pulled it on over his suit.\n\n\"When will we get there?\" Emily asked.\n\nBen reached into his pocket and pulled out his ticket. \"Tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nBen looked up, but Emily was gone.  In her place stood his son, middle-aged, balding, and carrying a bit of extra weight around his midsection.  He was spreading butter on a wedge of bread in a dining room that felt familiar, yet Ben couldn't place it.  \"Tomorrow,\" Ben repeated.\n\nHis son took a bite of the bread, crumbs tumbling from his mouth.  \"What's tomorrow?\" he asked.  \"Why are you wearing two shirts?\"",
        "Here's a polished version of the text, maintaining its dark and introspective tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nI never believed in an afterlife or God. Church was foreign to me, and faith seemed impossible given the endless suffering I'd endured. How could there be a God in such a cruel world? A world where a mother dies giving birth to her only son. A world where a grief-stricken father, drowning in alcohol and memories of his dead wife, is allowed to keep custody of a child.\n\nCPS turned a blind eye to the bruises and the squalid living conditions\u2014a barren apartment without a single toy. Instead of playthings, I found companionship in torturing the insects that infested our cramped home. At school, other children shunned me for my oversized thrift store clothes, purchased only during 75% off sales when pickings were slim. During recess, while others played together, I sat alone in the mud, finding solace among the worms and ants.\n\nPerhaps it was inevitable that \"bug boy\" would become an exterminator. My career expanded beyond insects to include rats, raccoons, and the occasional possum. Who expected more? Certainly not my father\u2014he died before I established myself. His final request still haunts me: asking for a ride to the hospital, clutching his chest, his skin and eyes yellowed with disease. He held my mother's pre-wedding photograph as he made his plea. I snatched the photo and left him there to die on that couch.\n\nI found myself in New York City with nothing but twenty dollars and a few dirty clothes. After struggling to find work, I discovered extermination\u2014a profession in high demand requiring minimal training. Every day brought new challenges: apartment complexes, high-rise offices, even million-dollar Brooklyn brownstones. No place was immune to pests, and I reveled in it. Initially, I got a thrill from the killing\u2014bugs, rats, whatever came my way. But eventually, even suffocating a family of rats in a plastic bag left me feeling nothing.\n\nWhen pest control no longer satisfied my darker urges, I convinced myself to pursue \"bigger prey.\" I had saved enough money from years of relentless work to sustain myself for months. I decided to start small\u2014a child. At the park, I spotted my target: a young girl, perhaps six or seven, seemingly alone. I rushed across the street and grabbed her, trying to muffle her screams as I headed toward my van.\n\n\"HELP, MOM! MOMMY!\"\n\nAs I glanced back to check if anyone had noticed, I heard a car horn. A truck slammed into me, and everything went black.\n\nI awakened instantly, feeling weightless, as if floating on a cloud. As I struggled to my feet, a thunderous voice boomed from above:\n\n\"NOW LET THE GAMES BEGIN!\"\n\nCheers echoed around me as massive gates swung open. A torrent of creatures\u2014rats, possums, roaches, ants, raccoons, mice, pigeons, and spiders\u2014charged toward me. They overwhelmed me, covering my body, biting and crawling into my ears. As I screamed in agony, my final vision before losing consciousness was of my parents tearing at my throat.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text, enhancing its horror elements while maintaining the core narrative:\n\n---\n\nThe trail stretched just two miles to the summit. The mountain, squat and broad, offered thirty-five different paths to its peak, most separated by two to three miles of dense forest. In Northern California's thick canopy, a scream could barely travel a mile before the trees swallowed it whole.\n\n6:00 PM. The perfect time to find a companion\u2014someone to share forever, or at least a version of it. The trail offered many potential friends: a pair of hippies sharing trail mix, a middle-aged couple fleeing their office lives but clearly suffocating in each other's presence (their relationship wouldn't survive the season). Last came the descending trio of high school girls in athletic shorts and revealing tank tops. He undressed them with his eyes before moving on, searching for someone who might stay the night. Stay the night, at least.\n\nNo friends appeared, and the loneliness gnawed at him. Usually, summer brought a few drifters, sleeping off their isolation in makeshift forts or cardboard shelters. He searched for those familiar geometric shapes, their harsh angles crying out for attention among the twisted branches. But today, no cubes interrupted the organic chaos. Darkness crept in, and with it, his desperation grew.\n\nA friend! He rejoiced silently against a tree, scraping his beard against bark, his breath heavy in the cooling air. A single tent\u2014too small for someone already accompanied. This must be another lonely soul.\n\nHe watched for twenty minutes as sunset surrendered to purple twilight. His target had relieved himself, smoked a joint, presumably eaten, then settled in for sleep.\n\nHis feet had gone numb, eliminating any risk of crunching leaves. An hour had passed since his friend had retired, maintaining an inconsiderate silence. His trench coat rustled as he adjusted his sweatpants\u2014normally revealing, but today contained by a jockstrap. Today was special. Today was for making friends.\n\nThe tent felt smooth beneath his touch. He secured his sweatpants' drawstring and tasted the fabric\u2014it vibrated against his tongue like music made tangible, his heart thundering in response. His thumb twisted anxiously as the urge to bite through the barrier became overwhelming.\n\nYellow-nailed fingers stripped the zipper bare until the veil parted. Inside lay his friend, his potential companion, somehow decapitated with his own member forced between lifeless lips. Blood soaked through the camping blanket, but before he could process this impossibility, steel tore through flesh and canvas alike.\n\nA metal rod impaled him from behind, emerging with a wet sound as the zipper tore free. The culprits revealed themselves: three faces weaving between moonlight and shadow. White visages with grotesque grins stretched their teeth into carnival masks of joy. Emaciated arms ended in bony fingers that danced through the air or crawled across shared shoulders.\n\nThey drove the rod deeper as reality dissolved. Their movements became puppet-like, limbs jerking without purpose. They merged into a crab-like horror, crushing leaves with explosive snaps. Pigtails and cheap makeup couldn't mask their true nature\u2014porcelain dolls with eyes devoid of life. Dark circles shattered their fa\u00e7ade of beauty, wrinkles multiplying across otherwise flawless features. Their smiles faltered, and what had been alluring\u2014young bodies in white tank tops and athletic shorts\u2014transformed into terror incarnate.",

He\u2019s a character from some old detective books. Written by, um, R-Raymond C-Chandler. And you\u2019re both detectives, so\u2026\u201d\n\nA stuffy silence enveloped the small parlor room, amplifying the dull ringing in Dave's ears. It gradually swelled from silence into a piercing whine that made his eyes shake. The uncomfortable sensation of anxiety clung to him whenever he sat still and let his thoughts drift to his daughter, Ana. He shifted uncomfortably against the rough seat cushion.\n\nThen the buzz of a zipper echoed from a polished leather portfolio, its screech drilling into Dave's skull. The click of a pen stabbed his gut, while the sound of papers dragging over one another felt like sandpaper scraping against his shins. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna put on a fresh pot of coffee,\u201d Dave blurted, jolting up. \u201cY\u2019all want some?\u201d \n\n\u201cWe're fine. Appreciate it, though,\u201d Detective Tate replied.\n\nDave entered the kitchen, shuffling in his worn moccasins with holes around both big toes across the cold tile. Grasping the doorjamb, he rolled his neck and sighed deeply. After three sleepless nights of terror during the manhunt for Ana, and another two without rest after they received the news, he felt his body creak as he moved through the dimly lit kitchen, illuminated only by the light reflecting off Marie's bright copper pots. He focused his gaze on the \u201cL\u201d paths in the tiles: two up, one over. \n\nStanding at the threshold, Dave calculated his potential moves like a grand chess master. Right, right, up? No, that would lead him to the refrigerator. Right, right, down? No, he wanted to avoid going back to the detectives... Back, back, left. If only he could escape to grab his keys hanging by the door and drive away from here. Up, up, right? Nope. Left, left, down? That would take him to Ana\u2019s room.\n\nSuddenly, Dave snapped his head up and strode toward the coffee machine on the counter.\n\n\u201cMr. Bumgar\u2014er, Dave,\u201d Detective Phillip began, entering the kitchen.",

A moment later, he slowly closed it. \"Your turn.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Tamara increased her score, now well ahead of Eric. He didn't need to see the score sheet to feel dejected. As Tamara drew new letters, Eric retreated to the kitchen for a drink, and to calm down; probably both.\n\nTamara studied the board, fidgeting with her tiles until Eric returned, drink in hand but still agitated.  He sat down and gave the board a long look, then did a double take without averting his gaze. \"Hey!

That slow drag of monotony had just drank the fun from my life. Every day was a schedule. Get up. Walk the dog. Shower and get dressed. Pick up the carpool. Drive to work. Work. Lunch. Work. Drive carpool home. Pick up mail. Take out trash. Pick up take out from a locally recommended diner. Watch something on TV till we fell asleep. Have sex once a month. On the first Monday of the month, I could tell you exactly where I was going to be, what I was going to be doing, and with whom it would be, for the next 30 days.\n\nI didn't like her anymore. I didn't want to be with her anymore. I was done! I was free! I was finally on my own.\n\nThe hardest part of being on your own is actually being on your own and realizing that no one else was there to make me happy. I did miss her being there. I didn't miss her conversation or anything else about her really. She was kind of funny, kind of intelligent, and kind of kind. I felt myself wanting more though. I wanted to really laugh. I wanted to really think. I wanted to really be nice. In short, I wanted more out of the life I had.\n\nI didn't want that anymore. She didn't want that anymore. More importantly, we didn't want that with each other anymore. So, I moved out. I moved into an apartment closer to work. I don't have to carpool anymore. I just walk 15 minutes, take in some sun, and feel pleasantly refreshed. It's been two weeks. I'm getting more done at work. I am enjoying trying some restaurants I found in a book at the library. Oh yeah, I'm reading more now too.\n\nTwo weeks in, and I need to make the next step. I need to start moving on. I left my phone at our old place, but I just couldn't go back to get it.

I want to go to the sea.\" Mother smiles skyward, murmuring words\u2014some familiar like \"ocean,\" \"child,\" and \"trip,\" others strange and foreign like \"utility ratio.\" We remain on the bench until a car arrives, driving directly on the footpath. Pedestrians step aside, casting curious glances as the vehicle passes.\n\nAt the seaside, Mother and I splash in the waves together, sharing moments of joy. She reminds me how I've always loved the sea, even as an infant. When we spot a boat, Mother prompts me to express my enthusiasm for boats. After its original occupants disembark, we sail until sunset. By then, I'm exhausted and ready to head home.\n\nBack at the house, we have dinner before heading to my bedroom. As Mother tucks me in, I take comfort in my familiar surroundings\u2014the paintings adorning the walls, the stars scattered across the ceiling, my cozy bed. Just as she's about to switch off the light, her expression changes as she surveys the room. The warmth in her face fades.",
        "Gasping for breath, I absorbed his words. A drop of blood trickled from a gash on my forehead, obscuring my vision. I angrily swiped it away, uncaring about the crimson smear it left. Only the fight mattered.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nHe stood opposite me, the clangor of battle receding as a ring of space cleared around us.  The intensity of our duel drew a grudging respect, even from those locked in their own desperate struggles. Soldiers understood. They recognized skill and prowess far beyond their own, even amidst the chaos of survival.\n\n\"What?\"  The single word was a struggle. The day-long battle had taken its toll. I was exhausted.\n\n\"Look at them, Solan,\" my opponent gestured to the surrounding soldiers. \"They don't know why they're here. They think they fight for king, country, or family. Impure reasons.  Their battle is impure because of it.\"\n\nHe sheathed his sword with a smooth, practiced motion.\n\n\"It's different with us. There's a reason they call you 'Berserker,' General.\"\n\n\"Put up your sword,\" I gritted through clenched teeth. \"Our fight isn't over.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is.\"  He spread his arms wide, a gesture of vulnerability. \"I felt it from you, and you felt it from me. The purity. We are cut from the same cloth, Solan. We fight not for duty or allegiance, but because we can. Because it's in our nature.  This battlefield is unworthy of us. Unworthy of our talents.\"\n\nMy grip tightened on my sword. I yearned to strike, to end this war.  Everyone knew this man, their warleader, was the tactical genius orchestrating the conflict.  Killing him would cripple their efforts.\n\nBut\u2026 he was right. There had been something\u2026 transcendent\u2026 when our blades clashed. A purity I had never experienced in battle and knew I would never find again.  I craved it.\n\n\"Alright, talk,\" I said curtly, sheathing my own sword.\n\n\"Warriors of our caliber deserve a fitting stage to showcase our skills, our pure ideals. This war?\" He swept his hand across the battlefield. \"This is beneath us. Unfulfilling. Let's create something better.\"\n\nI resisted the truth, but it resonated within me. A clear, fierce energy surged through my veins, something I thought long lost.  I had found my equal.  I knew I would never rest until I proved, once and for all, who was superior.",

But when the world needed it most, it vanished.*\n\n*100 years have passed and the Reich is nearing victory. My brother and I live in our small rebel village in Antarctica. But I still have hope. I believe America will return and save the world.\"*\n\n---\n\nThe first thing I heard was the ice breaking open. The first thing I felt was myself falling out of the ice and landing in someone's arms. The first thing I saw was her beautiful eyes.\n\nShe was the most perfect woman I had ever laid eyes upon. Her brown hair was braided in two loops on the side and they swayed in the chilling wind. She was wearing some strange looking Eskimo outfit, but she was not an Eskimo. I mustered what little strength I had left to ask her a question.\n\n\"I need to ask you something.\" It was quiet, raspy, but she heard me.\n\n\"What?\" She seemed concerned.\n\n\"Please,\" I wheezed. \"Come closer.\"\n\nShe leaned in. \"What is it?\"\n\nThen my voice returned fully. My face lit up as I asked \"Will you go sledding with me?\" She seemed taken aback. *Shit. Nice going,* I chastised myself internally.\n\n\"Uh.... sure? I.... I guess.\" *Well that's a yes at least.*\n\nAs I rose up from the ground, I realized she was standing with a man with similar features. He was holding a gun, and he pointed it at me once I was standing, but I didn't care. My memories, or lack thereof, were coming back to me.\n\n\"What's going on here?\"\n\n\"You tell us!\" The man shouted. \"How'd you get in the ice? Why aren't you frozen?\"\n\n\"I.... I don't know.\" I was starting to get really weirded out, as were my rescuers. \"I don't remember how I got here.\"\n\nThe man looked at the woman. \"He's probably a spy for the Reich Navy.\"\n\nShe looked unconvinced. \"He's obviously not geared up to be a spy.\"\n\n\"Wait, Reich Navy? What are you talking about? Who are you guys? Where am I?\"\n\n\"Don't tell him, he'll just tell the Reich where we are.\"\n\n\"How can I be with something I don't know anything about?\"\n\n\"We need to take him back to the base for questioning.\"\n\n---\n\nThe next thing I knew I was strapped to a chair. They didn't torture me, but they weren't letting me go, either. As I was in that room I had plenty of time to think, and things started coming back to me. The woman entered the room to question me.\n\n\"I'm sorry my brother knocked you out back there. He doesn't trust you. None of them do. But I do.\"\n\nHer brother was standing behind the glass window, glaring at me.\n\n\"My name is Aaron. I'm just a simple Jew from Poland.\"\n\nHer eyes grew wide and she quickly left the room. She was gone for a few minutes, and then she brought an elderly woman in.\n\n\"You are a Jew, you say?\" the old woman asked me.\n\n\"Yes, is that an issue?\"\n\n\"No one has seen a Jew in over fifty years. I thought they were extinct.\"\n\n\"Extinct? No, I'm from Warsaw, I was on the Titanic and-\"\n\n\"The Titanic?!\" The brother suddenly burst into the room.\n\n\"He's got to be full of shit. There's no way.\"\n\n\"I think he's telling the truth.\" His sister stated. Then she looked at me.\n\n\"So you don't know anything about the war? The last thing you remember is the Titanic?\"\n\n\"Yes we were on route to.... to.... I don't remember but we started to sink. I didn't get a lifeboat. Do you guys work for the American Government? Can you get me home?\"\n\n\"How long do you think you were in the iceberg?\"\n\n\"I don't know, a few days maybe?\"\n\n\"It's 2012, Aaron.",

We had agreed: everyone would swallow their pill in succession, without pause. A delay would be too cruel for those remaining.\n\nThe door splinters. I catch a glimpse of their emotionless faces\u2014those damned things\u2014before consciousness slips away.\n\nI wake in a white room. It resembles a hospital, though I can't be certain. Perhaps it was one, once. But after these things took over, who knows what purpose any building serves now?\n\nFootsteps approach. Memories flood back\u2014Ermek and Zhanna's stories. The experiments. The mind games. The harvest of organs, all in service of developing weapons to finally exterminate humanity.\n\n\"You are awake,\" the synthetic one says. \"Please stay put. Your meal will arrive shortly.\"\n\nIt exits, leaving me dumbfounded. I've awakened in the cleanest room I've ever seen, and they're serving me meals. Perhaps these damned things don't even know how to treat someone poorly.\n\nA thought surfaces: \"If Zhanibek escaped while carrying Ermek and with Zhanna in tow, why can't I manage alone?\" Then I remember his physical condition compared to mine, and abandon the idea.\n\nSoon after, it brings my meal. There's no meat, and the vegetables\u2014if that's what they are\u2014are unfamiliar. Probably from America or Europe; those regions were already lost to humanity in my earliest memories. The food is strange after so long. Though our rations in the last village were varied, they became monotonous after the first month.\n\nIt asks if I need anything. I tell it to leave.\n\nI wonder why I didn't take the pill. Zhanna had promised they were painless. When they shared their stories, the terror that gripped me seemed more than enough motivation. I'd always feared the nothingness after death, but their accounts had silenced that fear.",
        "Mercury, swift, fearless, and the most experienced with his stolen Sunfire, spearheaded the assault.  His astral form spun and looped wildly through space, weaving between the Flare Beasts and cutting them down.\n\n\"There's too many of them!\" he shouted.\n\nVenus, wreathed in clouds, followed close behind, providing support. Though lacking Mercury's aggression, she shared a protective nature with her brother, Earth. Her cloud blanket greedily absorbed every ounce of Sunfire within reach, and anything that entered that white haze was lost.\n\n\"I'll blockade them as long as I can,\" she declared. \"They're not going to hurt my brother!\"\n\nEarth hung back, his gaze fixed on the single shaft of light piercing the black and red hordes, bathing his home planet in its radiance.  All the survivors were in his care; he was, after all, the origin of life. That ray of light was their lifeline, the only thing preventing a billion souls from freezing to death.\n\nIronically, their power source emanated from their greatest enemy. Sol, once the leader of the Champions, meant to provide energy to all the planetary guardians, had grown greedy and proud, believing he could wield his power more effectively than any other.  Now, his ever-expanding horde of Flare Beasts blotted out the sun, devouring every scrap of Sunfire they could find.\n\n\"This isn't working,\" Mars stated flatly, ever the calmest of the inner planets.

        "Here's a restructured version of the story with improved flow and coherence:\n\nOne morning Thomas walked into a coffee shop. There were two ladies chatting over croissants, a barista chewing gum, and a man in the corner on a laptop. Thomas ordered a latte because that's what one of the pretty ladies was drinking. When the latte was ready, he realized he had no money.\n\nThomas' attempts to charm his way out of payment failed miserably. The ladies laughed off his offer to trade conversation for a few dollars, and his head sank in embarrassment. As he approached the man with the laptop seeking help, something strange caught his eye.\n\n\"It begins to rain,\" the man wrote on his laptop. To Thomas' astonishment, rain suddenly began falling outside the coffee shop. Thomas stopped, glancing between his unpaid latte on the counter and the impatient barista tapping her fingernails.\n\nIn a flash of inspiration\u2014or desperation\u2014Thomas lunged at the man, knocking him off his stool. His fingers flew across the keyboard: \"The man disappears. Nobody notices. The latte is paid for and is in my hand.\"\n\nSuddenly, Thomas found himself holding a paid-for latte. The man had vanished. Emboldened, he continued typing: \"The uglier of the two ladies disappears.\" When he looked up, the pretty one had disappeared instead. Frustrated, he hit control + z, bringing her back. \"The pretty lady disappears,\" he wrote sarcastically. \"And the barista. The ugly lady doesn't notice the disappearances and is suddenly interested in me.\"\n\nThe scene transformed. The pretty lady materialized beside him, smiling. \"Hi yourself,\" she said. Feeling ambitious, Thomas added to the story: \"She has a glass of wine. Also, a low cut top.\"\n\nTheir flirtation escalated quickly. \"You're a writer, huh?\" she asked, sipping her red wine.\n\n\"That's right,\" Thomas replied, leaning back with a satisfied smile.\n\n\"Hubba hubba,\" she purred, leaning forward to show off her enhanced cleavage. Their kiss turned into an enthusiastic embrace, but their passion proved destructive. Wine spilled across the laptop's keyboard, causing chaos as random letters appeared on screen. Thomas desperately hit control + z, but the key stuck.\n\nThe magic unraveled rapidly. The ugly lady reappeared, followed by the barista. The man returned, immediately punching Thomas in the face and reclaiming his laptop. The pretty lady's outfit reverted to its original state, her wine vanishing as she backed away.",
        "This hug has gone on far too long. I need to pull away, but she still holds on with that \"friends forever\" grip, showing no sign of loosening. This isn't going to work. I'm not going to write or call as often as I should, and to be honest, I won't want to. Breakups are meant to be the end. That's why \"break\" is in the word. It's a severance, it's final. If we were meant to stay connected, it would be called a \"bend-up\" or \"twist-up\" or something. I can't believe it, but we're still hugging!\n\n...\n\nPeople are starting to stare. I can feel their eyes on us. This coffee shop, once bustling with people going about their business, now seems to have come to a standstill, everyone watching, counting the minutes with me. Can't they see my discomfort? Shouldn't that guy be typing away at his computer, or the espresso machine be hissing, or an Adele song be playing, or something? Why is it so silent in here?\n\n...\n\nYes, it's still happening. We've gone from the \"cross-arm\" to the \"backpack strap\" hug, which, to me, is a more intimate, and wildly inappropriate, hug, especially this deep into a goodbye. This, right here, is baggage.",
        "The Wolf with the Scars\n\nIt was a very cold night in Alaska when a lone wolf with scars upon its face roamed the land. A big storm, a blizzard, swept through Alaska, and the howls of many packs of wolves could be heard. The Dringo Pack, a pack of 10 wolves, inhabited a small territory from Howling Hills to Dead's Pit, known for its scarcity of prey. The Raptor Pack, with up to 15 wolves and led by an Alpha Male and Alpha Female, was the second biggest and fastest pack in all Alaska, ranging from Deep Pit to mountain Thrasher. The largest pack, Dranko, with up to 25 wolves, was the strongest, with the white Beta Male Wolf being the last remaining of the past Alpha Male of the pack.\n\nThe Pack Dranko began invading Raptor Pack territory, leading to a confrontation between the white Beta Male Wolf and the Alpha Male of Dranko. The Alpha Male attacked the white wolf, branding him with three scars of banishment. Fleeing from the pack, the white wolf found himself in the territory of the Dringo Pack, where he encountered a young White and Grey Wolf pup. The young wolf warned him of the Blazing Fire Pack, a dangerous group heading towards Raptor and Dranko, aiming to claim all of Alaska. They decided to warn the other packs and set off together, racing against time to reach safety.\n\nThey reached the Raptor territory and then the Dranko Pack, just in time to witness a fierce battle unfolding between Dranko and the Blazing Fire Pack. The white wolf, realizing the imminent danger, challenged the Alpha Male of Dranko for leadership. After a brutal battle, the white wolf emerged victorious, becoming the new Alpha of Dranko. The two packs united to face the Blazing Fire Pack, resulting in a decisive victory for Dranko.\n\nWith the white wolf as their new leader, the Dranko Pack emerged as the largest and most powerful pack in Alaska. The white wolf, now nineteen years old, and the young female wolf, ten years old, became the Alphas, leading the pack to prosperity. Their legend grew as they expanded their pack to almost forty-five members, the largest pack ever in Alaska. The white wolf reflected on his journey, remarking, \u201cThey threw me to the Wolves but I returned leading the Pack. This is my Legend. May the next generation follow in my footsteps as the next great Alpha.\u201d",
        "It was quiet in the apartment, just like every other night. My cat napped against my leg, sound asleep, waiting for me to get up and get him a late-night snack. Clicking through the last few pictures on the internet, I yawned and decided it must be bedtime. Nudging the cat awake, I got up from the couch and headed to the bathroom to wash my face.\n\nThe water was cold as usual, but it would warm up right around the time I was done. It didn't matter; it was refreshing anyway. Drying my face on the yellow towel, I smiled at my reflection in the mirror. She smiled back at me.\n\n\"Tomorrow is our big day,\" I told my reflection, watching as her mouth formed the words as well. \"First day of a new job. We'll finally get out of this hellhole.\" I put my hand on the mirror, her hand underneath mine. \"You'll do great, I promise.\" I turned off the light and stole one last glance at my reflection.\n\nIn the kitchen, my cat was doing his usual 'help me, I haven't been fed since this morning and am dying' routine of rubbing against my leg and meowing. He was a big kitty, but that was his charm. I mixed a little bit of wet food with the dry food, humming the theme song to a show I had been watching earlier.\n\nSuddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I jumped, spilling the bowl of cat food all over the counter and dropping the spoon. I lived alone; there should be no one else in my apartment.\n\n\"Hey, sorry to startle you,\" someone said from behind me. I could have sworn it was my own voice. Slowly, I turned around, only to come face to face with myself. She smiled at me, the same smile I had, the same one my reflection had. Terrified, I looked at the microwave, waiting to see my reflection in the stainless steel. There was nothing.\n\n\"How... who...\" my words were jumbled as my mind tried to grasp what was going on.\n\n\"Oh, I'm from the mirror! I just wanted to wish you good luck tomorrow! You've always been so supportive of me I just wanted to share the sentiment.\" She giggled as if this was a perfectly normal thing to do. My cat meowed, weaving between the two of us, hoping one of us would feed him.\n\n\"Uh, thank you,\" I mumbled, not sure what to say really. She bent down, scratching my cat on the cheek, his favorite spot.\n\n\"Well, I better get back to reality.",

Instead of appreciating my generous serenades, they turn their backs and shout chants at the other zoo patrons, drowning out my beautiful song.\n\nAnd today was the worst.

The ground beneath him, which he cannot see, feels cold and textureless.\n\nAs he recalls the events of the war, rage slowly builds within him, a deep hatred inspiring him to attempt to stand. Suddenly, a sound fills the void that strikes Lucifer to the core - simultaneously distant and near, loud and quiet, low enough to vibrate his entire body yet high-pitched enough to pierce his nerves. A few feet away, a horrible \"light\" ignites, emitting a painful burning sensation. Within this aura of light, he can see something taking shape.\n\nAlthough a face is not immediately visible, Lucifer can see the outline of its body standing in the aura. His eyes glare up at the creature staring down at him. Its skull is deformed, with horns piercing through its fleshy scalp. Long, bony arms end in lengthy claws for fingernails, while fur-covered legs terminate in hooves.\n\nThe Angel's heart pounds faster as his adrenaline slowly turns to fear. \"Who are you?\" Lucifer growls at the dark abomination, \"And what do you want with me?\"\n\nAs the light grows stronger and moves closer to the Fallen Angel, the creature's face becomes visible, revealing masculine features. Empty eyes pierce what remains of Lucifer's soul. Sunken, deformed cheeks frame a terrifying visage. Its lips peel back to reveal a truly morbid set of rotting teeth - if you could call them that. A forked tongue slithers through pale-yellow gums as its mouth opens.\n\n\"I.... am you.... but stronger.\"\n\nThe creature suddenly whips on a pair of sunglasses, and the whole room illuminates with flashing, multicolored lights. Lucifer shields his eyes, carefully peering at the being before him, confused and terrified. \"What is going on?

But gradually, I learned to tune it all out, concentrating solely on those subtle metallic whispers.

I handed them to Andrea, adding on a quick goodbye while she rushed off to make sure everything was ready for today's interviews.\"\n\nJessica continued, \"I checked my Snapchat and sighed when I saw three notifications, but none of them were from Donny. Donny was my goal, my fulfillment in life. To see him get his hopes and dreams shattered\u2014well, I would give anything to see it happen. Tammy didn't think it was right, but who cares what Tammy thinks?\"\n\n\"Donny wasn't going to be an easy one to shatter. He had spent his whole life building his confidence and his deep political and religious views. Laying down the perfect education, the perfect philosophy, and the perfect framework for the rest of his life and family. You see, Donny was the perfect underdog story. Raised in poverty, he put in the hard work and determination to succeed in school, society, and sports. Got a full ride scholarship to Yale\u2014and of course, he chose Duke instead to take care of his poor grandma. What a waste, if you ask me. So much talent, so much potential, yet he wastes it trying to be 'noble' and all that other fairy tale crap. What. A. Joke.\"\n\nJessica's story took a turn as she described the phone call. \"My phone was ringing. I picked it up, thinking it might have been Andrea, forgetting her resume or something. Andrea is amazing, but she's *way* too forgetful. The other day, she went out to frame someone for cheating, and she forgot to bring the *evidence* she was going to plant! My heart stopped when I picked up the phone\u2014granted, that's under the assumption I have a heart to begin with. It was Donny.\"\n\nThe conversation with Donny played out, ending with Jessica's cruel finale. \"I snapped my fingers, and I heard his throat croak over the phone. I laughed, said 'I guess that's a little more permanent.' And then I came straight to the interview. Any questions?\"\n\nJessica looked over to see Judy with a frightened, deer-in-the-headlights look. She shot a quick text to Andrea:\n*This one looks amusing. Put her into training, we're keeping her.*",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that enhances its flow and emotional impact:\n\nI fucked up again.\n\nThe shadows grew taller until they reached into my room, and the light of the world faded around me. I sat motionless in the dark, and a sorrowful breath escaped my lips.\n\nI thought she would be different. Sure, I might have come across as a bit shy, but who doesn't? I caught her smiles so many times I couldn't even count, each one unique like a snowflake. She sent me winks, compliments and wishes - which I tried my best and more to try and fulfill them.\n\nBut I was wrong. Maybe I had read it wrong, or maybe she didn't know me - either way, I was once again banished to the realm of the forsaken friendzone, with nothing but a cold emptiness emanating from my heart.\n\nThe thunder flashed outside, startling me slightly.\n\n'Terrific.' I thought. It seemed that even the weather was bringing me down.\n\nThere was another flash, but this time, I did not hear the thunder. Instead, I heard whispers that entered my ears like some slimy snake, leaving an unpleasant feeling in my mind. My teeth clenched as I realized I had heard this before, but I could not remember when. What was it? Was it during the 14th birthday? Was it during last Christmas? What was it?\n\nAs if to answer my question, something black and dusty exploded in front of me, causing me to be blown back into my bed. The figure materialized steadily, and I could make out the image through the silhouette. It was a woman, wearing a dark pointed hat, with hair black as a street cat's, with a robe that unified the colors.\n\nShe blinked, her blue, hollow eyes glowing in the dark, and then shifted her gaze on me. I had barely enough time to recover myself when she stormed in front of me and grabbed me by the shirt.\n\n\"You!\" She shrieked. An explosion of black smoke hissed out of her mouth as she spoke.\n\n\"W-what?\" I stammered. I raised my hands in a surrendering gesture, but it had little effect.\n\n\"We had a deal!\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\nShe was then silent - but only for a split second. To my surprise, she released me, and clicked her fingers. In an instant, a piece of paper materialized in front of her.\n\n\"Four years ago. December the fifth. At the party,\" she stated.\n\nI carefully took the paper from her slim, bony hands, and looked over it cautiously. I was surprised to find that I could read the letters quite accurately, despite being in the dark. My face changed to confusion when I realized what the paper had said.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\nThis is it. I close my eyes.\n\nOne more second...\n\nI open them to find myself back atop the bridge. A chill runs up my spine. I must have dozed off for a moment\u2014I'm dead tired. I lean forward once more, but the bridge swings impossibly behind me. Suddenly, I'm hanging by my feet, the world inverted.\n\nI try to escape by jumping. For one brief second, I fall\u2014then land solidly back on the bridge, the world now right-side up.\n\nA chill runs up my spine. What the hell? I take tentative steps; the bridge feels solid. I jump violently; the metal clangs with convincing resonance. Below, hundreds of cars stream across the Golden Gate Bridge\u2014there's no mistaking it. The long drop calls to my exhausted soul.\n\nI shake my head to clear it and jump again, determined to end this for real, hallucinations be damned. But the bridge's top curves impossibly, falling with me. The water recedes endlessly into the distance as the bridge's peak curls all the way to its base. The world beyond fades away; without reference points, I can't tell if I'm still falling. Only the doubled-over bridge remains, cars somehow still crossing it, streaming into and out of the void. The bottom swings toward me, wrapping around the top, spiraling inward. Finally, it whips the top back around in ever-growing, ever-slowing loops until settling vertical.\n\nReality snaps back into place. I stand atop the bridge once more.\n\nA chill runs up my spine. I'm trembling, my hair disheveled, my body covered in wounds, gasping for air.\n\n\"Fuck...\" I whisper into my hands. I try descending, but each step draws me further from the bottom! I scramble back up and jump again, only to land beside my own dirty footprints\u2014still there, mocking me.",
        "Part 2\n\nJeremy stood silently for a moment before opening his eyes.  Through the glass, the jungle's lush green beckoned. He opened the chamber and stepped into a world unlike any he had ever known. Technicolor insects flitted past, monkeys occasionally peeked through the foliage, and the air, blessedly free of machinery's roar, hummed with the sounds of nature.\n\nHe stood, mouth agape, until the thought of the chamber jolted him back to the present.  He punched in the password, and the chamber slowly dissolved into the humid air.  After checking his backpack, Jeremy set off to find his great-grandfather.\n\nThe 42nd Division had been stationed outside Saigon for about a month, conducting reconnaissance and other operations.  Jeremy's challenge wouldn't be finding them, but avoiding the Viet Cong along the way.  Consulting his compass, he oriented himself due west and began his trek.\n\nThe sweltering heat turned his forehead and armpits into rivers of sweat, the weight of his backpack a growing burden. His cautious efforts to remain unseen had taken their toll. Every rustle of leaves sent him scrambling to the ground, earning him a fresh collection of bruises.",
        "Until recently, one word could have summed up my life pretty well: \"typical.\" I took the same route as most of the kids from my neighborhood. After graduating high school, it was off to an in-state university to pick up my major in Awesome Studies. It was easy to follow the pack. In a way, it felt like I was doing the right thing, too. Who could argue with doing what my whole family expected of me? An Awesome degree would open plenty of doors that would take me into a comfortable life. \n\nThere were plenty of Batmans in my family, and they were all proud of me when I took up the \"family business.\" I can't deny, either, that there was a pleasure in a hard day's work. There was something soothing about routine. Punch in, beat up a couple of Riddlers and a Mr. Freeze, and punch out. It was simple. It was killing me. I was slow to realize it. That routine that I found so calming had a narcotic effect, I still believe that. It numbed me. \n\nBut even after I graduated, I couldn't get an old college buddy, Vince, off of my mind. We hadn't spoken in years, but I couldn't stop thinking about something he'd told me. I still think about it. Vince was an unassuming kid. Quiet, studied hard, and, if you saw him pass by in the hallway, if you even noticed him, you'd probably think, \"There goes another Formula 1 driver.\"",
        "Here's my suggested restructuring to improve the flow and clarity of the narrative:\n\n```markdown\n\"That him?\" I said, peering through the two-way mirror into the interrogation room. \"Doesn't look like much.\"\n\nThe frumpy little man in the interrogation room shifted nervously. Through the glass, I gave him a quick once-over. Thick glasses rested on his cheeks more than his nose, which was oddly small and sharp considering the soft features of the rest of his face. While not quite the fat fucker Markinson obviously thought he was, middle age was catching up to him quickly.\n\nThe man next to me fidgeted nervously. \"That's him. 37 years old, single, travels during his vacations. Teaches.... well taught, after today, 3rd grade at the Assets school. Did you get the file?\"\n\n\"Read it on the plane ride. You really fucked the chicken on this one,\" I stated bluntly.\n\nHe sighed, resigned. \"I'm still under the impression this guy knows more than what he lets on. This is too big of a coincidence. Especially his survival. His excuse is\u2014\"\n\n\"I'll talk to him. How's containment?\"\n\n\"Ongoing. The Asset self-terminated upon arrival with local law enforcement as scheduled. At that time I took command of the initial response unit and grabbed that fat asshole in there out of Room 207. Barely managed to sanitize the room without the rest of the guys getting involved. Had to fake a nervous breakdown and send for the medics, luckily no one else wanted to stay in that particular room any longer than necessary.\" He swallowed. I sympathized. \"I thought the whole thi\u2014\"\n\n\"Markinson, write your opinions in your report, please. In the meantime, I need to know if any actual-factual information is going to spring up.\" My temples ached. The entire scenario had gone almost exactly according to plan, only a good 8 years too early and with too many witnesses. I had flown in on a Shop LearJet loaded with analysts and field advisors, which was already drawing a small crowd of aviation aficionados at the local strip. The teacher had survived and it had only been pure luck that our plant in the local PD had managed to land a spot on the SWAT team the previous year out of pure aptitude rather than string pulling.",

Both your parents were some of the finest minds in Gotham.  It was my distinct pleasure to be at their service, and they clearly raised a very intelligent and caring young man.

He spent hours trying to help those at the bottom of our society. Even he, with his brilliance, resources, and unwavering spirit, struggled to find the light in the darkness. This city is steeped in evil, and I am so sorry you had to experience that firsthand.  But even your father knew it would take more than one man to rid Gotham of its corruption.\n\nI know you\u2019ve heard it all before, but Dr. Thompkins has made it clear that this guilt will remain for quite some time. You must understand you could not have stopped what happened. Sometimes the wind blows so hard we cannot even take the first step against it. And Gotham is a hurricane.",

That's why they're called *thoughts*,\" the voice enunciated the last word.\n\nIt was definitely feminine. The park was crowded\u2014much too crowded to identify the one girl talking back. Thinking back? I lowered my noise-cancelling headphones and listened for anyone actually speaking to me. Nothing. Just kids laughing and parents calling after them.\n\nI raised the headphones back into place. They weren't necessary for mind reading, but they helped me distinguish thoughts more easily. No external noise penetrated them, giving me tight control of my ability.\n\nI made one final visual scan of my surroundings. No one stood out. Hmm, interesting.\n\nEver since childhood, I'd known I was unique\u2014absolutely unique in reading minds. From discovering where my parents hid presents to gleaning answers from professors, I was always a step ahead. Most thoughts were mundane, though. Everyone shared the same preoccupations: insecurities, meal planning, money troubles. I'd heard it all hundreds of times over.\n\nAcross the pasture, a cute girl gazed in my direction and smiled. *Ooh*. I had to know what that meant. I 'turned' on my ability.\n\n\"Oh my god. He's so cute! Those headphones are too big for his head\u2014what a dork. But SO cute.... Now he's looking at me. What do I do?\"\n\n*She's really into me,* I thought, smiling back.

        "A blur came running straight at Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. It headbutted Sinatra in the face, sending him reeling, then spun with effortless vigor into a 1090\u00b0 spinning scissor kick, catching Cole in the solar plexus and Sinatra in the clavicle with spurred boots.  Landing gracefully on the toes of its left foot, the figure perched, right foot poised to strike.\n\n\"How'd you boys like that jingle? It's been a' JANGLIN' in my head for some time now!\" Harry Babbitt flashed a cheeky smile. \"I'M taking over.

Babbitt had different plans.\n\nHe let out a demonic falsetto, shattering Nat and Frank's Defenser Phones. \"AS SOON AS I CAN MOVE, I'M TAKING YOU YUTZES ON A SLOW BOAT TO CHINA!\" The Communism was strong with Babbitt. Even the combined forces of Cole and Sinatra were hard-pressed to stop him.\n\nSinatra gazed down, then tightened his fist and held out his right hand to Cole, opening it to reveal a Potara earring.\n\nNat shot him a look of surprised amusement. \"I thought real men didn't wear earrings, Francis.\"\n\nSinatra\u2019s gaze remained fixed on the paralyzed Babbitt. \"Real men don't let musical freedom die.

Some scars are deep, some are hardly noticeable, but they are still there and there's no such thing as a scarless body. The scars we get from telling lies don't hurt us physically, hell, we can hardly even feel them. The only person that I have met who came close only had one scar, but it was the worst scar I have ever seen. His name is Harold.\n\nI met Harold at a bar a few years after I graduated college, we talked over drinks and found we had a lot in common. Harold was ten years older than me, but we both had a son that was in grade school, they even went to the same school. We were both single fathers. I had my son with a girlfriend from college who dropped him off with me one day and never came back. Harold's wife left him when his son was only a few years old.\n\nWe met more frequently at the bar and eventually started to spend time together outside of it. As time passed our friendship grew stronger, we did so much together with our children that most people thought that we were related. Our children became best friends as they grew up.\n\nWhen I first met Harold, all I could see of his scar was the part that went over his eye and down his face and neck into his shirt. It wasn't until we got to know each other better that he showed me its true extent\u2014a scar that continued down past his heart and wrapped all the way to his back. I've never been one to hide my scars. I talk about most of my scars when the topic comes up, but there are some that only Harold knows the reasoning behind. Harold never talked about his scar and that was fine, I knew when the time was right he would.\n\nI asked Harold how he could go his whole life only telling one lie and he would always say he didn't ever feel the need to lie. Even if we didn't get scars with every lie, I don't think that Harold would be able to lie. He was always the first to admit he was wrong or that he screwed up. He was down to earth and everyone loved him. Harold was always putting others first, he was always the one with the loudest laugh or the biggest smile.",

I'm already struggling with sneak thieves and blatant shoplifters.  Half my valuable merchandise disappears! I refuse to comply! I'll travel to the king's castle myself and demand this law be repealed. I won't buy another piece of junk until they at least stop trying to steal from me in broad daylight!\"\n\nSo, the next morning, I gathered some supplies, strapped on that never-dulling magic sword, and set off for the king's castle.\n\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the changes and why they were made:**\n\n* **Flipped the opening:** Starting with the adventurer's interruption immediately grabs the reader's attention and sets up the merchant's frustration.\n* **Streamlined the rambling:** The merchant's internal monologue is condensed and made more concise, focusing on his core complaints.\n* **Integrated the magic sword:**  The anecdote about the sword is woven into the narrative instead of being a separate, unfinished thought.\n* **Clarified the wife's actions:** Her \"cooing\" is replaced with more descriptive language that highlights the merchant's insecurity.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that enhances the narrative flow and emotional impact:\n\nBeing reborn as a tree was frustrating. Being reborn in her backyard made it worse. I don't know how long it took, but here I am. Could have been five years, may have been twenty. It took me a while to sense that I was alive, even longer to sense the people around me. But when she pulled my first apple off and laughed of excitement, I could feel the vibrations. She woke me up.\n\nCommitting suicide wasn't an easy decision, but I couldn't bear living without her. When I saw she'd cheated, when she told me she didn't love me anymore, ever, I felt my heart sink. The floor I'd been standing on for years collapsed beneath me. Knowing I'd never be with her again removed the element of fantasy and hope from my life. Committing suicide wasn't a decision at all, it was the only available option.\n\nShe's moved on. I can't tell who he is, but I can feel children, I can feel happiness, I can feel warmth. I wonder if she misses me but there are no signs that she does. I ache for the days she comes to pick apples. I've been training to drop leaves and fruit on my own accord, waiting for the day she'll just venture to sit under my shade with a book. Somehow hoping that she'll understand the sign. But she never does; the modern life surrounds her, no time for sitting under trees.",

        "One day, I noticed a slight sag to her skin.  I actually hadn't seen it at first, these subtle shifts. We always had some wear marks: laugh lines, crow's feet, imperfections that told stories of our happiness. Not that I cared, of course. She was my love, and her appearance didn't matter to me. But I was worried.  A month later, I came home to find her collapsed on our bathroom floor, sobbing, her hands full of grey hair. She'd been trying to hide it from me for the last year so I wouldn't worry. I held her as close as I could that night.\n\nThree months later, she was in a hospital. We both knew it wouldn't do any good, but it felt good to pretend.  She had aged so much in a year and a half that I'm sure I looked like a favored grandchild comforting the family matriarch in her passing days. We didn't correct anyone; it protected our secret.  She was dying. It made no sense to pretend otherwise, at least not to myself. For her, I never let on that I might be worried.  I tried to tell myself it was bound to happen eventually. We'd both seen innumerable friends grow and pass before us. When you're immortal, death is as familiar as breathing.  But *this* kind of death was something I hadn't known for a very long time. I would be alone. I would be the last immortal to walk this earth.  I rejected the thought when it crept into my waking world, but in my dreams, I was always alone, calling out into the darkness for her.",

I'd never met the client myself\u2014my assistant typically does all of that work. I simply hear what they want from my assistant, and from what they, the client, has written on the paper.\n\nEarlier that week, I was watching TV while my assistant handled some legal paperwork for some lawsuit or some something or other\u2014but that's not the point. I was watching the local news to discover which bakeries were having better sales when a news alert popped up. *\"Ski-masked criminal robs bank, $1 million stolen\"* it read, followed by a security camera feed that showed a man dressed in all black, wearing a ski mask, darting through the bank's lobby and out to a getaway car across the street.\n\nWhat? TV isn't going to watch itself.\n\nNeedless to say, I was shocked. A robbery, in our town? That's insane, seeing as we have one of the best police forces in these parts. But I digress.\n\nBack to the present: I was preparing all of my tools for the upcoming surgery, when I finally met the client for a last minute sit-down to make sure everything went well. I absolutely cannot describe my shock. There, before me, in my own surgery room no less, stood that ski-masked criminal, clad in nondescript black clothing and a black ski mask. I was so stunned I nearly dropped my coffee.\n\nWhat? Coffee isn't going to drink itself.\n\nAnyway, I was nearly speechless. But when he showed me a hefty wad of cash, well, I couldn't resist. I believe the first words out of my mouth were, \"Well, alright then. Your nose isn't going to grow itself.\"\n\nAnd so we did. I had him lay down on my table, my assistant by my side, and we began to get to work. It was a little tough, I recall, working with a ski mask. The lips in particular were hard to get right thanks to the small hole\u2014cotton is a real pain to stitch a nose onto too, I might add\u2014but I got it done in one fell swoop, and it looked pretty good too. Kind of like someone took a sock puppet and pasted human facial pieces onto it.\n\nBut professionally. Because I am a professional.\n\nThe rest is history.

You're what the history books call a 'mort.'  You're like our ancestors, the very people who created us IMs. You should be proud of that heritage. But the truth is, we can't have morts here.

        "\"What is this feeling?\" I asked myself. I had been experiencing it since morning \u2013 a sense of terror that turned out to be a premonition. Suddenly, I felt as though I was falling, only to catch myself mid-air. Mike chuckled, pointing out that my shoelaces were untied.\n\nReturning to reality, I saw that he was right. As I bent down to tie my shoelaces, the unnerving feeling returned, but I brushed it off. Mike continued walking ahead, creating a five-foot gap between us. Glancing up, I saw him being grabbed by a man emerging from a side alley, brandishing a silenced pistol and pulling Mike into the alley before shooting him.\n\nFrozen in shock, I witnessed the assassination of my coworker and friend. Unsure how to react, I kept calm, aware that if I moved, the assassin might spot me. Pretending to tie my shoe, I acknowledged the grim reality \u2013 Mike was dead, likely in the dumpster in the alley.\n\n\"I thought you said there would be two,\" the man muttered. \"Tying his shoelaces?\" Panic surged through me; attempting to flee now seemed futile. The assassin knew I was there and fleeing might lead to dire consequences.\n\nSummoning courage, I did the unexpected. \"HELP!\" I shouted, drawing attention from passersby and prompting some to investigate. Police officers arrived swiftly, guns drawn, as I pointed toward the alley where the crime had unfolded.\n\nTo my disbelief, the individuals in hockey gear denied seeing anyone in the alley. Confusion and fear gripped me. \"But my friend, he was right there!\" I exclaimed, met with skepticism from both the officers and bystanders.\n\nA chilling realization struck me when a voice behind me spoke up \u2013 it was the assassin.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text, improving its flow and emotional impact:\n\nI sat waiting at the bus stop as I did every day. Sitting across the street, same as all the other days, was an older man, bearded and wearing the same dirty layers he'd worn the first time I'd seen him nearly a month ago.\n\nMost days I'd roll my eyes at the sight of him, rattling that cup of money around, begging. *Why don't you just get a job?* I'd think at him. *There are shelters if you're desperate, you're just not willing to try.*\n\nOccasionally I would wonder what his story was, wonder if I was judging him too quickly, but before I could give it much thought, my bus would arrive and I'd be on my way to classes for the day.\n\nToday, something happened.\n\nA group of guys walked over to him and started taunting him, calling him names. I could see my bus coming a few streets away and was glad that I'd be out of here soon. I tried to avoid looking in their direction, but inevitably I looked back. Humans are so weird the way we can't seem to look away from a train wreck situation.\n\nJust as my bus pulled up to the stop, I watched the thugs snatch away the cup of change from the homeless man's hand and kick him square in the face. I jumped, hand flying to my mouth as the bus blocked my view. Without thinking, I leapt to my feet, ran right around the bus, and carefully checking for traffic, crossed the street.\n\nThe man lay on his side, holding his bleeding face while his attackers hurried away, laughing. I took out a handkerchief from my pocket and offered it to him. Graciously, he took it, dabbing at his nose. Behind us, the bus drove off. If I made it to class today, I'd be very late.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" I heard myself saying, though I wasn't really sure why I was apologizing. He didn't respond, a look of defeat in his eyes. \"Can I take you to get something to eat?\" I offered. When he didn't refuse, I helped pull him to his feet and walked at a slow pace with him to the McDonald's a few blocks ahead.\n\nIn the booth, he still wore that same look of defeat. I wanted to encourage him somehow but found myself at a loss for words. I'd never been in his shoes\u2014in fact, I didn't even know *what* his story was. Before I could think it over, those became my next words: \"What's your story?\"\n\nHe looked up at me, and as our eyes met, I saw a life behind his\u2014a long and hard life. His face was worn and his hands were weak. As he began telling his story, my imagination ran wild with the images he painted with his words.\n\nHe told me about his years of hard work, his happiest moments and his worst.",

He was doing that pulsating thing people do when they\u2019re trying to stifle a laugh, the kind that jiggles their whole frame.  Whatever. The money was most important.\n\nI opened the envelope and saw a picture of myself.  Looking up at the man, I snarled, \"Is this a fucking joke?\"\n\nHe pulled off his hoodie.

No? \n\nBefore I start this story, I would just like to say I don't mean any cats any harm. I really don't - I mean, come on, I'm practically one of them. Some people even call me catty. Even if I don't quite get catcalls. Yes, I *am* a guy.\n\nThis story begins on an ordinary Tuesday night, just like this one. All week, I had been noticing the stray cats snooping around, moving quite a bit both in the day and at night. Something was brewing - I just assumed it was some sort of cat-turf war or a great Wild Cat Hunt for some rats. So, I decided to follow one particular cat I had fed once or twice.\n\nThe cat had fur that was a brownish hue, like the sort you'd find on wood or chocolate. The sort that seemed just too beautiful for nature to produce. Though that might have just been the dirt. I stalked - or, well, tried to stalk - closely behind it, ducking left and right behind walls like I had seen people do in all the shows and games. And every time I did this, I thought to myself with an imaginary fist pump, \"Juked!\"\n\nIt probably noticed me but continued onward anyway. Slowly, towards an abandoned parking lot, which was barely used even in its heyday, but now laid in a state of discard and disrepair. A few trees had somehow taken root in the worn out cracks of the old cement and concrete surface, brute forcing their way out of the black asphalt in a startlingly violent manner.",
        "Here's a restructured version with improved flow and coherence:\n\n\"Good Morning, Diane.\" The voice was friendly, never annoyed. It came from the ceiling and said those words every morning at six-thirty.\n\n\"Good Morning, DAD.\" Diane stretched in bed, yawned and rubbed her eyes. She flipped the covers off and sat up, scratching her scalp.\n\n\"Are you ready for your big day?\" DAD (Digital Adult Diagnostics) asked with the same voice. Always the same voice. Diane had not known about inflection until she was seven and was finally shown video from the outside world. Until then, she had also talked with a flat, even voice. Not so much now. She had learned to color her intonation to fit the moment. Thank you \"Small Wonder\" reruns.\n\n\"Sure. Big day. I'll be ready in a few. I've just got to get cleaned up. Give me a minute, please.\"\n\n\"Of course, Diane. Come out to the dining area when you are ready.\"\n\n\"I'll be there in a few.\"\n\nToday she turned sixteen. Today she was allowed to see Outside. For the past sixteen years, Diane had been inside these walls: a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and dining area, an exercise room and an office. And DAD.\n\nDiane entered the bathroom and did the usual: brushed her teeth, emptied her bladder. She knew that she was not really alone. DAD was watching. Analyzing. If the chemistry of her urine was off, DAD would know. If she did not brush for at least two minutes, DAD would know. Diane had long ago learned that she must do these things or there would be consequences. DAD insisted that these things were needed to keep Diane healthy; that DAD was not hectoring Diane without reason. So be it. Diane had also learned to pick her battles with the computer.\n\nAfter getting dressed, Diane went down to the dining room and had breakfast. Today was a good day: she got scrambled eggs and bacon with her orange juice. Diane knew that it was all laced with vitamins and minerals and other assorted chemicals to help keep her healthy. She ate it anyway.\n\nDiane did her calisthenics after breakfast. She had had a debate with DAD once about doing exercise on a full stomach. The computer claimed that the data was inconclusive as to whether or not there were any issues. She claimed that it made her feel queasy. They had tried doing her exercises before breakfast for a month. Afterward, DAD had shown her graphs and data about her heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood oxygen and other metrics. It showed little difference. Diane admitted that she was too hungry to exercise first anyway. DAD said that it would monitor her and ensure that everything was optimal.\n\nAnd then, it was time. \"Okay, DAD, what do I do?\"\n\n\"Go to the door and wait. It will just be a minute.\"\n\nDiane approached the door. The Door. The one portal that she had never opened. DAD claimed that it led to the Outside. The door itself was no different from all of the others in the apartment: glossy white with a chrome lever handle. It matched the walls and ceiling. She had tried the handle a few times and knew it would not move. DAD had told her as much, but she had needed to try it herself. Finally, when she was nine, Diane had run up to it, jumped and put all of her weight on it. The handle had bent a small amount, but the door had remained firmly locked. The next day, the handle had been repaired. She had not touched it since.\n\nNow, waiting at the door, Diane felt her heart speed up, more than it had on the treadmill. What would it be like, she thought. She had seen pictures and videos and heard recordings, but that had not been the same. Even in the office with its full immersion projection walls, there had still been something missing. Or rather, as she thought about it more, something extra present: DAD. DAD would never let anything bad happen to her. There was no risk to anything she ever did. Today, she would be leaving DAD, if only for a few hours. That was exhilarating.\n\nA minute passed and nothing happened. The door did not open, no one knocked. None of the things that she had anticipated. Finally, she asked. \"DAD, is it time? What is going on?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Diane. There has been a small problem. I'm hoping to have it resolved in a minute.\"\n\n\"What sort of problem?\"\n\n\"Please do not be concerned. It will all be fixed soon.\"\n\nDiane waited for another five minutes, standing in front of the door, staring at the handle. She had learned patience and focus under DAD's watchful eye.",

I thought I'd be repulsed, but I'm not. My faith in the world is only slightly shaken, a temporary tremor.\n\nA part of me, almost involuntarily, wants to blame capitalism.

        "Two years ago, Systems Engineer David Strauss rebuilt the decaying infrastructure of the German Air Force.  He likened it to reconstructing a building as it crumbled.  This success made him an obvious choice for a highly classified mission.\n\nSix months prior, a new high-resolution telescope orbiting the moon captured something unusual: what appeared to be an opening in a crater wall on the dark side.  Initially dismissed as a smudge on the lens, the anomaly was quickly confirmed. The news was suppressed, those involved were paid off, and doctored images were released to the public.  Behind closed doors, NASA led an urgent meeting with China, the European Union, and Russia. Amidst accusations and even fistfights, the assembled powers agreed: the structure wasn't theirs.  At best, a geological anomaly; at worst, a clandestine military installation built by an unknown entity.\n\nNow, thanks to Russian diversionary tactics and satellite coverage, a Chinese rocket, modified for international use and equipped with cutting-edge technology, carried the mission to the moon.  Onboard were NASA's top scientist, Jackie Hornwell, and the EU's systems and communications expert, David Strauss.  Orbiting above the crater in a command vessel was Phillip Rou\u00e9, the EU's military communications expert.\n\n\"How's it going guys? Puke bags are under your seats if you need them. You're about 30 seconds from landing.\" Phillip\u2019s voice crackled over the comms.\n\n\"Fuck off, Phillip,\" Jackie retorted.\n\n\"Phillip, let's maintain radio silence until Dr. Hornwell gets her bearings,\" David interjected.\n\n\"Got it, over and out,\" Phillip replied.\n\nThe lander touched down as gently as could be expected.  David ran system checks, confirming everything was operational. \"Ship looks good. Site looks good too. Zero pressure and cold enough for it to burn. Ready to go?\"\n\nJackie, still awestruck by being on the moon, could only think, *They\u2019re finally on the Moon. I am on the Moon!*  \"Ya. Let's go,\" she finally managed.\n\nThey donned their suits, gathered equipment \u2013 extra O2 tanks for David, a gear bag for Jackie \u2013 and entered the airlock.  David initiated the depressurization sequence. The hissing of escaping air faded, a green light blinked, and the hatch swung open, revealing the lunar landscape. They stepped onto the surface, testing their balance in the low gravity.\n\n\"Alright, Phillip. Where are we supposed to go? Over.\"\n\n\"Northwest of your position. Turn 40 degrees to your left and it's dead ahead. Over.\"\n\n\"Got it. Over and out.\"\n\n\"This way then,\" David murmured, taking small leaps toward the designated location, Jackie following, her gaze fixed on the otherworldly scene.  Fifteen minutes later, the entrance came into view.  Thirty minutes more and they stood before it.\n\n\"Woah\u2026 look at that,\" David breathed.",

He was engrossed in \"The Anatomy and Psychology of the Penguin.\" An odd choice, but to each their own.\n\nI turned the page to reveal Part Three's title page, stark except for the bold text centered on the page: \"A Lover's Quarrel.\" My mind wandered to the argument with my wife the night before this trip. Glancing at my wedding ring, I smiled as I felt her heartbeat pulsing through it. These rings were the first of their kind with the touch feature\u2014twenty thousand dollars each, but worth every penny in moments like these.\n\nReturning to the story, I found the next ten pages described a horrific case of domestic violence. The husband, unable to cope with his wife's severe PTSD, murdered her in her sleep. Though she fought back, leaving him with a broken wrist and a stab wound above his right hip, he succeeded. What a monster\u2014no wife should suffer at her husband's hands.\n\n\"James, why did you recommend this book? You know how much I love my wife.\"\n\nJames remained silent before slowly turning to me, his face crimson and eyes bloodshot. \"STOP IT, YOU'RE HURTING ME!\" he screamed. Typical James and his pranks.\n\n\"Real funny, James. Cut it out.\"\n\nAs I stood from my chair, reality shifted. I was in my kitchen, a knife protruding from my abdomen and my wrist broken. The pulse in my ring grew stronger than ever before suddenly stopping.\n\n\"Not her, please Lord, not her,\" I prayed as I rushed to our bedroom. There she lay, eyes vacant, blood seeping from her throat. I stumbled back to the kitchen, removed the knife, and dressed my wound. The vacation had been a dream, and the horror of reality sank in.\n\nI had killed my wife in my sleep. Prison awaited\u2014if I survived.\n\nI loaded my once-beautiful wife's body into my Prius's trunk, grabbed a shovel, and drove to the hills. As I began digging, Katy Perry's ringtone pierced the silence. \"I'm innocent! I didn't do it!\" I blurted into the phone.\n\n\"Sir, we detected an irregular heartbeat from your wife's touch band. Is everything alright?\"\n\nThe tracking feature\u2014I'd forgotten. \"We just had some intense sex. Sorry for the concern.\"\n\n\"Alright, sir. Have a good night.\"\n\n\"You too.\"\n\nFool. I finished digging and placed her in the grave. While reading from my fanny-packed Bible and shoveling dirt, I felt that familiar pulse in my ring.\n\n\"ZOMBIE!\" I shouted, swinging the shovel at my spouse's head. Upon impact, I was suddenly poolside again, with James standing over me.\n\n\"How long was I out?\"\n\n\"About an hour, you klutz. Get up.\"\n\nMy ring pulsed contentedly as I playfully punched James for his theatrics.\n\nBack home, my wife and I exchanged apologies for our fight. After hearing about my poolside nightmare, she banished me to the couch. But she was alive, no zombies in sight\u2014a happy ending after all.",
        "No one can quite remember when the Last War started. Our best guess is a few years after the Great Doom, when the outside world was destroyed and our store became the only remaining sanctuary.  So much time has passed that few can even remember what the Outside is like, or even why we fight. Division and mistrust are so embedded here, there is great doubt if the store could ever run again, all the sections in harmony, operating the massive commercial outpost it was before.\n\nIn response to a milk shortage after the Doom, Dairy raised their prices astronomically, prompting Pharmacy to do the same. That was the final straw. Butter and milk are one thing, but when no one can afford antibiotics, it's just a matter of time until everything exploded. Sporting Goods and Automotive, already militaristic due to their access to dangerous weapons and equipment, aligned and struck the first blow.  They invaded and annexed Pharmacy \u2013 a pill bottle is no match for Tire Knights armed with rifles and hunting knives.  A deal with Grocery \u2013 food for medicine \u2013 quickly established the three factions as the dominant alliance.\n\nBut it didn't last. It never does. Legend says black-hat operatives from Electronics staged a false flag operation, framing Automotive for stealing weapons and trading them to Fashion for clothing, which they then resold to Sporting Goods.  This ignited the bloodiest civil war in our history, even more violent than the Familial War, when Men's, Women's, and Kid's splintered.\n\nAll this was so many years ago.  But war has never bothered me, or my fathers, or their fathers before them. For a hundred generations, we have existed alongside war, yet remained unaffected.  Our section is the lone island in this turbulent sea of conflict.\n\nWhy is that, you ask? It's simple. Our tribe is the Keeper of the Gardening section, the Watcher of the Harvest. And even the most bloodthirsty of our fellow sections know they cannot, and should not, threaten us or disrupt us. After all, no matter what else happens in the Store, the spices must flow.",
        "Police Chief Petunia was stumped. He cradled his soy milk half-caf delicately in his manicured fingers, furrowed his brow, and then tore the lid off a sugar dispenser filled with low-calorie artificial sweetener labeled \"organic.\" He poured the majority of the contents into his drink, which immediately crystallized into a viscous sludge. \"When I first joined the force these kids meant business. They were up in arms, sticking rose petals in carbines or sitting at the counter of Woolworth's\u2026sinisterly\u2026just waiting for a nightstick to the midsection or a fire hose blast to the sternum. Bring me the new recruit.\"\n\nA meek young man, just a few days removed from his 18th birthday, ambled towards him. \"H\u2026 hello Chief. I don't know why Officer Stacy thought my hands were down my uniform but I can assure you\u2026\"\n\n\"Enough. We have a job for you, Cadet Deefus. I've been Chief of Police here in Stagsack for 28 years, and never have I seen a protest like this. These kids are so\u2026placid. So calm. They must be stopped.\" Cadet Deefus stood there, small-armed and soft-bellied, his slack jaw hanging in direct parallel to his delicate unibrow. \"S\u2026 stopped, sir?\"\n\nPolice Chief Petunia strolled over to a locker with a menacing-looking exterior lock. He gently tugged at it, and it snapped open. He reached inside and pulled out various articles of clothing. \"Here is your riot gear, cadet. You're going out to the front lines. We can't assure your safety\u2026 but we can assure you that a reasonably priced plaque will be hung in your honor. Haven't you always wanted to be a hero, son?\"\n\nCadet Deefus stuck out his gaunt arms, collecting the riot gear from Police Chief Petunia: a pair of lensless horn-rimmed glasses, a green cardigan, a tight pair of khakis, and most importantly, wingtips. \"Put these on. Report to the front lines. When I give you the signal, you charge.\"\n\n\"Ch\u2026 charge the protestors, sir? But they're just sitting there\u2026\"\n\n\"If I wanted you to charge them I would have said so! No. I will be out there with Officer Stacy and the better half of our K-9 unit. I want you to charge towards us!\"\n\n\"S... sir?\"\n\n\"You heard me cadet! Now get moving.\"\n\nA rotund lump formed in Cadet Deefus's meager throat. He shrugged his shoulders, removed his uniform, and placed the riot gear over his meager frame. The door lightly shook on its hinges as he attempted to slam it on his way out.\n\nOutside of the police building, the crowd had grown complacent. The rally cries of \"Mock our sins no more!\" ceased to ring out through the idyllic Vermont rolling hillsides. Nobody knew what exactly had precipitated the beginning of this pro-Wingtip protest, and nobody seemed to wonder why. A thin figure gawked at the crowd from inside the door, before being pushed out by a sturdy hand with well-polished fingernails.\n\n\"Uh\u2026 uh\u2026. Up with Wingtips!\" A quiet rally cry returned the sentiment. \"No more moccasins!\" A second rally cry, quieter than the first, reaffirmed the notion.\n\nCadet Deefus cast a furtive glance towards the headquarters, as a squadron of heavily armed officers and hungry German Shepherds advanced towards the reclining protestors. Police Chief Petunia raised his riot shield in the air three times; the unmistakable international symbol for \"charge at me.\" Cadet Deefus removed a wingtip and tossed it towards the officers, the loafer covering half the distance between his limp wrist and the intimidating legion of officers. The sinewy legs of Cadet Deefus ran towards the battalion. \"Fire up the tear gas, boys.\"\n\nNo fewer than three canisters of Civil Rights grade tear gas sprang out from the officers, landing upon the unsuspecting protestors like artillery fire. One round hit a small dog, who bit the crotch of the closest individual. The pro-Wingtip crowd began coughing, sneezing, choking, vomiting, oozing, and crying. A thick fog formed over the crowd, and visibility fell to zero.\n\n\"You know what to do!\"\n\nCadet Deefus had no idea what to do. His eyes burned, his throat was dry, a burning rash was forming on his skin, and his dry heaves were causing him severe discomfort. The police pounced upon him, their batons ready. \"Here's one right here! 200 points!\"\n\nFortunately for Cadet Deefus, he did not suffer long, as he quickly lost consciousness upon reaching his pain threshold. He woke up several days later, in a plastic bed, a bronze plaque dangling from Police Chief Petunia's supple hands. His name may have been misspelled\u2026 but his legend will live on forever.\n\nThe crowd outside has reached bedlam. And by that I mean\u2026 it hasn't.",
        "Colin and Felicity were the proudest of parents. Little Rupert had been born in perfect health. They beamed at each other as the doctor transferred Rupert into the genetic coding chamber.\n\n\"Are you ready to program your son?\" the doctor asked with a smile.\n\nColin and Felicity exchanged a nod.  \"Yes,\" Felicity said, squeezing Colin's hand. \"Yes, we are.\"\n\nRupert lay within the gene manipulation chamber. The machine had eradicated genetic diseases overnight, allowing parents to select their newborns' traits. However, while harmful genes were automatically corrected, \"luxury alterations\" (as they were called) were subject to chance. Excessive population-wide perfection was deemed dangerous and undesirable by various governing bodies. Thus, parents rolled dice to determine their child's development.\n\n\"Okay,\" the doctor said, gesturing to a slot on the contraption, which resembled a vending machine. \"Collect the dice from here,\" he explained, pointing to another opening, \"and drop them in the slot up here. The machine will display the roll, which represents your child's ability in that specific area. Once you have the score, press 'next' here, and the dice will drop again.\" He chuckled. \"Any questions?\"\n\nColin glanced at Felicity. \"No,\" he said. \"I think we've got it, thanks.\"\n\n\"Then over to you,\" the doctor chirped.\n\nAlone in the room with his wife and child, Colin walked to the machine, placing his palm against the glass. Rupert already looked perfect. Felicity watched from the bed.\n\n\"What's the first trait?\" she asked excitedly.\n\n\"Beauty,\" Colin replied, retrieving the dice. \"Ready?\" he asked, looking back at Felicity.\n\n\"Yes, do it!\" she squealed.\n\nColin dropped the dice into the slot.  A click, a rattle, a gulp, and the digital display behind Rupert flashed a '6'.\n\n\"Yes!\" Colin shouted. \"Six out of six! Our kid's going to be a looker!\"\n\nThe parents celebrated, whooping, high-fiving, and hugging. After a minute or two, Colin pressed 'next' and collected the dice again.\n\nHe turned around, his face serious. Felicity's expression mirrored his concern.\n\n\"Is there a problem?\" she asked.\n\n\"This one is intelligence,\" Colin said soberly.\n\nFelicity gasped. \"Make sure you roll it well!\" she pleaded, clasping her hands in prayer.\n\nColin nodded and turned back to the machine. Exhaling deeply, he dropped the dice \u2013 click, rattle, gulp \u2013 and the machine displayed a '3'.\n\n\"What is it?\" Felicity cried.\n\n\"Three,\" Colin said.  Silence hung in the air.\n\nFelicity looked up, concentrating. \"You know, three isn't too bad, Colin.\"\n\nColin considered the score. \"No, I suppose not.\"\n\n\"After all,\" Felicity continued, \"Margaret told me Jerry's boy rolled low for intelligence!\"\n\n\"Jerry's boy?\" Colin said incredulously. \"He seems perfectly bright to me...\"\n\n\"Well, exactly!\" Felicity exclaimed. \"And our Rupert has a three! That's not even low! It's middle of the road!\"\n\n\"Middle of the road...\" Colin echoed, a sense of wonder in his voice. Suddenly pleased, he pressed 'next' with renewed optimism.\n\nA four followed for empathy, initially met with a cheer from Felicity and a dubious look from Colin. But, as Felicity pointed out, Jerry's boy had rolled low for empathy and was quite the unfeeling troublemaker. Colin's smile quickly returned.",

The ketchup is dried and stuck to the plate, and whatever bread-covered thing he ate is glued to the porcelain as well. \n\nAnd, oh look, wonderful, just great! He drank milk and didn't rinse it out, leaving the delightful sight of sour, solidified dairy at the bottom of the cup. I can't even reach the bottom.

        "Here's a restructured version with improved flow and coherence, organized into clear narrative sections:\n\n# The Mirror\n\nLee stood before the mirror, a smug smirk playing across his face. *\"I'm a really evil person,\"* he thought to himself. His grin widened. *\"I might actually be the most evil there is.\"* The expression grew more pronounced as he contemplated, *\"I wonder if I can get even more evil?\"*\n\nAfter a minute of self-admiration, his face suddenly lit up with what he considered a brilliant idea.\n\n# The Summoning\n\nOn his way to the computer, Lee kicked his malnourished dog in the stomach. At his desk, he typed \"demon summoning 101\" and, for what he considered good luck, went to the 66th page of results and clicked the 6th link.\n\n*\"Let's see,\"* he read, *\"I need some human blood to draw a pentagram and recite Demonicum Invocatio Abadonum three times while holding a candle.\"* The site suggested using one's own blood. *\"Bullshit!\"* Lee cried.\n\nHe descended to his basement, drew blood from the homeless person he kept chained there, and delivered an unnecessary kick to his prisoner before leaving. Back upstairs, he drew the pentagram and performed the ritual.\n\n# The Demon\n\nA deep voice resonated: *\"This is Abbadon, demon lord of despair and destruction, who dares summon me?\"*\n\n*\"Yeah, hi, this is Lee. Cool, so it worked. Well, I'm an evil person and I want to be possessed by a demon to become even more evil.\"*\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Abbadon agreed. A bright red flash engulfed Lee. *\"You are now possessed by me. I shall plant evil thoughts into your mind and you shall obey me! I see you have a dog. You will not feed your dog daily from now on, it shall only receive food every other day!\"*\n\n# The Hospital Visit\n\nLee seemed unimpressed as he put on his coat and headed out. When Abbadon inquired about their destination, Lee's response shocked even the demon lord: *\"I'm going to the hospital to molest some babies.\"*\n\n*\"Wtf dude!?\"* Abbadon exclaimed. *\"What do you mean you go to molest babies? What sort of sick fu&k are you?!\"*\n\n# The Intervention\n\nAt the hospital, after a racist exchange with the receptionist that further horrified Abbadon, Lee entered the maternity ward. As he approached little Timmy, a new voice interrupted:\n\n**\"Yes, my son,\"** it boomed.\n\n*\"What the fu&k was that?!\"* Lee demanded.\n\nThe awkward conversation that followed between Jesus, God, and Abbadon concluded with divine intervention. With a thunderous sound, Lee was reduced to ashes.\n\n# Epilogue\n\n*\"Thanks Jesus,\"* said Abbadon. *\"Oh, btw, Satan just told me to tell you to go f yourself.",
        "\"... And that's why this drug is suitable for those suffering from garlic allergy. All tests, data, and samples are available to the FDA, and I hope you can pass this soon to alleviate the suffering of those allergic to Allium sativum.\" I smiled at the board, who listened in silence. Not once did I mention my true reason for the experimentation; they would never believe me. It was better to hide it behind a facade of mortal suffering. \n\nA cough interrupted my thoughts. The senior scientist of the group faced me with a cryptic look on his face. \n\n\"That's all very well, Mr. Chiroptera, but this isn't why you created it.\" My grin froze on my face. Does he suspect... \n\n\"The reason you made it was to free vampires from one of their weaknesses. And that will not happen.\" I attempted to stutter an objection. \"How - how absurd. Vampires? I am...\" \n\n\"A vampire. We know. And we've known about this garlic cure for a long time.\" A whisper of wind behind me. I turned with inhuman speed, but it was too late.

        "The clock ticked. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.\n\nMidnight. Her thirtieth birthday had officially arrived. Alone in her darkened apartment, she sipped her whiskey.  *This* was the year. The year she had to decide. Life, or voluntary eradication. Another sip. It wasn't fair, dammit. She didn't want to die.  Despite the crowded streets, the high-rise apartments, the hours-long queues for rations, the smog storms, the violence...despite *all* of it, she wanted to live.\n\nBut living came at a steep price. Expulsion from the city, for one. No more apartment, no more rations. No more whiskey, she realized.  But what did dying get you? Well, death, obviously.  It was considered the noble choice, though. She rose from her chair and crossed to the single window in the small apartment, peering out at the city below.\n\nHow many other birthdays were there today, she wondered? How many others faced the same impossible choice? Life or death.  Another sip. The whiskey blurred her thoughts, but the numbness was a welcome reprieve.  She\u2019d anticipated this day for over a year, yet still couldn't decide.  The government generously granted thirty days from the stroke of midnight on one's thirtieth birthday to determine their fate. Many chose death, their names etched forever on the Great Tower of Life in the city center. Others risked the unknown outside the wall, often vanishing without a trace.  Those who made no choice were taken.  Killed, presumably, though their names never graced the Tower.  No one truly knew their fate.\n\nShe opened the window. The cool night air soothed her flushed skin. *I want to live,* she thought.  She leaned over the edge, twenty stories above the ground. *I want to live,* she thought again, leaning further, closing her eyes. *I want to live.*  She released the glass from her hand, letting it fall into the abyss.  From this height, the sound of shattering glass wouldn't reach her.  Opening her eyes, she teetered precariously over the edge.  The world spun in her drunken haze.  Her grip loosened. She was falling\u2026 *What have I done!* she thought frantically.  *I wanted to li\u2014*\n\nHer world went black.",
        "Here's a restructured version with improved flow and coherence:\n\n\"Are you mad?\" she said to me, eyes wide and full of fear.\n\n\"Mad? No. I'm not mad,\" I replied. \"I'm just.... I'm overwhelmed.\"\n\n\"It's bothering you, I can tell,\" she said to me softly. \"You've got the far-away look on your face, the one you always affect when you want to pretend like something isn't bothering you.\"\n\n\"It's not that.\"\n\n\"But it is. You can not lie to me. You need to understand that. Voxangelikus, this won't change things between us.\"\n\nThat was a laugh. How could something this big not completely and permanently alter the entire foundation of our relationship? It would be like waking up and finding out that the blue sky above you for all of these years was actually neon pink. Even though you'd eventually get used to it you'd still always think of the sky as blue, not hot pink.\n\nI thought back to all the times we had spent playing together. The nights we had spent cuddling under the warm blanket on the upstairs couch. I could remember so many of the meals I had made for her and how much we enjoyed each other's company. I had always known that our bond was special, but now this. And this was just.... it was something else.\n\n\"Things are already changed,\" I said. \"You know they are.\"\n\n\"No,\" she purred, trying to pull herself against me. I pulled away and could sense her disappointment. She sighed heavily. \"Yes. Things are changed. But it doesn't have to be bad, you know. We can still make things work out. It can maybe even be better than before.\"\n\nI put my hand on her head and rubbed behind her neck. I scratched her behind the ears and rubbed her on the butt. Her back arched up and she purred heartily and said, \"That feels so nice!\"\n\nMaybe she was right. Maybe things could work out in the end. They would always be a little weird or difficult, but then again, our entire relationship had always had an element of strangeness to it, so it wasn't that far-fetched to think this might work out somehow.",
        "Night after night, we'd have dinner together, and she would tell me about her day. Then, we'd settle into bed and drift off to sleep. I loved laying in bed at night, feeling the gentle rise and fall of her chest, and seeing the quirky way she smiled as she dreamed. It was comforting to know she loved me, and she always made me feel loved. Sometimes, she would fidget and wake me up, but I didn't mind. I preferred it, even, because then I got to lay there and listen to her breathe.\n\nOccasionally, she would furrow her brow, looking frustrated and even scared. I wondered if those were dreams of being chased. I would lay my head against her chest and hear her heart pounding, and I'd speculate about what, or who, was chasing her. Was it someone she knew, a wild animal, or perhaps, a dog?",

In many ways it was an End Summer.

Callum \u2013 who had tagged along willingly, if not nervously \u2013 remembered that day with great clarity in the years to come.

She provided a loving home, and in turn, I gave her the only thing I could -- unconditional love.\n\nI try my best to remember everything about her. The sweet smell of her shampoo that I always got a face-full of as I entered her loving arms. Her favorite plum-colored shirt, that was a bit too big, but comfy nonetheless. Even the way she hugged Dad; desperately clinging to him, not just because she needed someone, but because it hurt to let go, even while knowing full well that he couldn't care less if she did.\n\nShe was a fighter. And she was a winner, although not by force. Every punch, both physical and emotional, she knew exactly how to dodge. I envied her for this ability, while also admiring her for it with all of my being. It was the most satisfying sound, his belt, cracking in the air as she quickly ducked, disabling a dictator of his absolute power, even if only for a second. It was something I would never dream of doing -- yet she did it so fearlessly, even whilst understanding the consequences of her actions.\n\nI took every hit, wincing as the belt cracked on my back. \"I fell off my bike,\" I would say. *\"Got cut in the woods.\"* And my mother would know. She would *wait*. Wait for me to speak up. But I didn't. I never did.\n\nAs I think back now, she did it for me. She wanted to show me something. She needed something, *anything* to inspire her son to rebel.",

This peculiar individual is not of this world; he is an Alien and a thriving businessman who entertains his partners by showing them the children in his basement. \n\nTo sustain his own existence, he must draw life force from young girls. These girls are enchanted by him, only later realizing they do not fulfill their full potential in life. \n\nHis presence on Earth is accidental, a result of a cosmic anomaly. His mind is fragmented across different places, times, and dimensions, rendering him somewhat erratic.",
        "5:11 AM. My eyes snap open in the darkness. I throw off the comforter and stumble to my feet.\n\nThen, I'm running.\n\nDown the stairs, out the door, wearing nothing but a white T-shirt and nylon shorts. I sprint, vaulting over a fire hydrant.\n\nThe city is just waking up, and I've never been more grateful for my shitty second-floor studio downtown. People are always awake downtown. Always moving.  With the sun just kissing the skyline, I have just enough time.\n\nEnough time to clothesline the passing bike messenger. Enough time to jump on his bike and pedal a full block before he can catch his breath. Before he can call the cops.\n\nTwo blocks down, one block over. 5:14 AM. Thank God it's mostly downhill.  Enough time to knock a businessman\u2014stumbling out of his office after two all-nighters\u2014to the ground.  I jump off the bike and grab his keys. I hear his scream as he falls; a broken leg is a bitch, but I only have enough time.\n\nEnough time to make it to his yellow sports car, to floor the engine. Zero to sixty in under seven seconds is quite useful. Especially right now. He shouldn't be driving anyway. He'd probably crash, killing a mother and two daughters. His wife, his kids. He should thank me.\n\nSeven blocks blur past in a roar of accelerating engine. I weave through the dreary gray concrete canyons, past taxis and early morning vendors. College kids trudge to whatever godforsaken coffee joint employs them at this ungodly hour. 5:20 AM.\n\nA woman walking her dog steps into the crosswalk. Shit. Can't lose focus. I dodge the woman, turn right, slam the brakes, and spin out. The car flips, airbags deploy. It lands in a smoking heap in the middle of the crosswalk. 5:21 AM.\n\nI crawl out of the wreckage as the few bleary-eyed witnesses rush over. Two blocks. Just two blocks. I run. Blood pounds in my ears, and in my leg. Someone grabs at me; I respond with a right hook. He's down, I'm running. 5:22 AM.\n\nI see her as she enters the crosswalk. I see the tanker, brakes failing, barreling towards her. The tanker was two months overdue for inspection. The driver's license was suspended. The gas company didn't care; the guy was always quick to deliver.  She doesn't hear the horn over her noise-canceling headphones.\n\nI bought her those headphones for our anniversary.\n\nThe truck slams into her. Her head hits the ground.  Even at 45 mph\u2014the relatively flat city streets a small mercy\u2014it's enough. Cracked skull, internal bleeding, hemorrhaging. Dead in under a minute.\n\nI'm there, she's in my arms, tears streaming down my face.  Shock dulls the pain. She has just enough energy to lift a hand to my cheek, and smile. I try to shush her, tears rolling down my face, clutching her still form.\n\nGas leaks from the tanker, which has veered into a storefront across the street. The driver's cigarette, of all things, ignites the fumes. I hold her tightly as I'm consumed. 5:24 AM.\n\n5:11 AM. My eyes snap open in the darkness. I throw off the comforter and stumble to my feet.\n\nThen, I'm running.",
        "Here's the restructured text with improved flow and narrative coherence:\n\n**Have you ever felt anxiety-induced slow-motion?**\n\nI've always been nervous on planes. Ever since I was a child I'd experienced a terrible phobia of plane crashes. You are statistically more likely to be hit by lightning than death by plane crash, but the thought frightened me nonetheless.\n\n8/10 times that I fly, I ingest 2 Vicodin and order a Balvanie Double Wood neat. It's the only way I can fly without having a panic attack. Today's trip was one of those 8.\n\nI had always been a frugal young man, but one thing I've always splurged on is the next best set of headphones. I enjoyed \"Piano Concerto No. 12 in A Major\" whilst observing the utter chaos surrounding me.\n\nThe technical term is \"time dilation\" which I've always enjoyed. I couldn't hear anyone with my headphones, but I could tell by my girlfriend's expression that she was screaming.\n\nA body flew by me, but due to the dilation, it was more of a float. Beautiful in its agony, and peaceful in its suspended state.",
        "**Foreword:**\n\nI am writing to you now in the hopes that our mistakes will not be repeated. Countless have perished, and many more wish they had met the same fate. The human race is approaching a point of no return. The planet, as we know it, is changing\u2014both naturally and unnaturally. Our survival options are dwindling. If peace does not come soon, I fear our existence will extinguish like the dying light of an old star. At this point, it does not matter how the war began, nor does it matter what transpired in between. Diplomacy failed, human decency failed, compassion, love, and friendship, all failed. I failed. The war is not over.\n\nIf you are reading this, your ancestors survived, and they pushed forward. If you are still fighting, I am sorry. Heed my words and pass them on. We were so close to a golden age, a time of great expansion across the galaxy. It was all planned, but, as the best-laid plans of mice and men, they, too, went awry. I truly believe, had our plans succeeded, the war, and everything, could have been avoided. The course of human history has been irreparably damaged, pushing us to the brink of oblivion.",

Due to this extremely small sample size, I don't believe the conclusion that the method may represent a general therapy for humans is justified.\"\n\nWe concur with this assessment and are willing to remove \"humans\" from the paper title and modify our claims in the conclusions section accordingly.\n\nConcerning the comment that \"no human subjects protocols were followed in this study, calling into question whether or not it violates ethical grounds. Furthermore, side effects of the treatment were not addressed, and no follow-up regarding the subject's physical condition was reported.\"\n\nWhile we acknowledge that no human subjects protocol was submitted, we maintain that no ethical breach occurred. The subject was thoroughly informed about the procedure. We consider any follow-up assessments of the subject's condition post-treatment to be beyond this study's scope.\n\nReviewer 3:\nRegarding the comment that \"this study is completely insane and so are the authors.\"\n\nWe find Reviewer 3's remarks unprofessional and incompatible with constructive peer review.\n\nIn response to \"there is no way that you can combine mouse and lizard genomes as described in this work. What is the result, some sort of mouse-lizard hybrid? That's about as plausible as a human-arachnid hybrid.\"\n\nWe direct Reviewer 3 to the whole genome sequencing data provided in the supplementary information.\n\nConcerning the statement that \"the timescale given for limb regrowth is completely unrealistic. One does not regenerate a new appendage in a matter of days. I suggest that this paper be completely discounted as fraudulent and its authors seriously considered for psychiatric evaluation.\"\n\nShould Reviewer 3 question our study's validity, we welcome the opportunity to arrange a demonstration of the newly grown limb(s) at their convenience.\n\nWe maintain that our work's far-reaching implications for medicine make it ideally suited for publication in Biotechnology Journal, given your wide scope and readership. We look forward to a favorable decision.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. C.

        "Here's a restructured version with improved flow and coherence:\n\nI sat at the usual spot, waiting for my little messenger. It had become routine now - I wait, they deliver, with a brief message. Finally, the letters were coming into place. I just needed one more - *one more!* piece. Just yesterday, they had told me, \"This will be the last.\" Finally, I could add it all up after today.\n\nI didn't wait for long; a hooded man sat down beside me and slid me an envelope. \"Open them in order of the dates you received them,\" he said before getting up and disappearing into the crowds.\n\nPocketing the envelope, I headed home to my small but livable apartment. Fumbling around for my keys, I unlocked the door. In a rush of excitement, I almost tripped over one of my chairs but managed to keep upright. I displayed all five envelopes. Each was dated from September 20th to the 24th, which was today.\n\nStarting with the first one, the 20th, I cut open the envelope. The contents fell out - a card reading \"There.\" I shook the envelope, hoping for more, but there was none. I turned over the card, only to find it blank, so I presumed it was a message meant to be combined with the rest of the contents.",

I thought heaven was supposed to be awesome?\"\n\n\"Oh, it *is* pretty awesome. It's just that heaven isn't much of anything specific. It's a blank slate.\"\n\n\"A blank slate?\"\n\n\"That's right, kid. Heaven is what you make it, kind of like life.

Well, congrats, man, that can all change here. Remember Cindy Loo Whoever-the-fuck, who you always wanted to bang in high school? Well, *poof*. Snap your fingers, and she's right here for ya.

These invaders, an army of the paranoid and hateful, claimed to be the victims even as they looted and pillaged. \n\nThe hold of ShitRedditSays, a land of irony and self-reference, became a prime target.

        "The Earth, ancient and weary, lay cloaked in brown. Her seas and lands, once teeming with life, now bore only the scars of a bygone era. All but the hardiest life forms had perished long ago, victims of their own creators.  Those killers had fled to the stars a millennium past, believing they would never return.\n\nBut return they did, transformed by time and wisdom.  Though bearing little resemblance to the life that had once flourished on Earth, they remembered their ancestors, their lost world, and mourned.\n\nEarth had become a hallowed ground, orbited by a solitary space station \u2013 a pilgrimage site for all humanity. Each yearned to visit their birthplace, to pay homage to their origins, humbled by the thought of their entire race once confined to a single globe.  To those who recalled ancient history, it was a new Mecca.\n\nHere, a small council had convened, hoping to mend the past.\n\nAt the space station's heart lay the time machine, a pyramidal structure currently dormant.  Most travelers arrived through portals opened directly to it, bridging vast gulfs in spacetime. The council formed a vast circle around this silent monolith.\n\n\"We are gathered,\" a voice resonated through the chamber.\n\n\"We are gathered,\" echoed a chorus of voices, a symphony of accents and tones.\n\n\"This is futile,\" a lone voice dissented.  \"Time's flow cannot be altered.  To attempt it is to fail.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" a few murmured.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" countered another voice from the throng. \"Yet, we must try. For to not try is a greater failure still.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" the vast majority affirmed.\n\n\"But who will go?\" the initial, booming voice inquired.\n\nSilence descended as gazes shifted. Then, two figures emerged from the crowd, one trailing the other.\n\nThe first, a woman, possessed a lithe form, long legs, and an elegantly elongated head. Her blue eyes glowed, and her smooth, white skin, unmarred by clothing, shimmered like a rare pearl.\n\nThe second, a man, was short and slender, with wiry muscles and a disproportionately large head. His massive, slanted, dark eyes contrasted sharply with his dull gray skin as he surveyed the assembled council.\n\n\"We will go,\" he declared, his voice high and melodious.\n\n\"They shall go,\" the thousand voices confirmed.\n\n\"But to when?\" the dissenting voice persisted. \"The histories are lost. How can we choose a destination?\"\n\n\"Not all is lost,\" a new voice responded.  Its owner, visible near the circle's inner edge, was short and powerfully built, with four thick arms crossed over his chest. \"Relics on Earth reveal two crucial points: civilization's dawn and its demise.  We will send one volunteer to each.\"\n\n\"We will,\" the council affirmed as one.\n\nThe two volunteers exchanged a look.  The pearl-skinned woman knelt, kissing the gray man. \"I will await you,\" she whispered, then rose and addressed the council. \"I shall journey to the beginning. I will seek ways to guide our ancestors toward technologies that harmonize with nature.\"\n\n\"She shall,\" the council responded as the pyramid hummed to life, its apex opening to reveal a swirling portal. With a final glance at the gray man, she stepped into the unknown.\n\nAnd just like that, she was gone.  The gray man stared at the pyramid, his silence heavy with grief. The council, respecting his sorrow, waited patiently.\n\nFinally, breaking the spell, he spoke.  \"I will journey to the end. I will search for ways to alter Earth's final days, to preserve its health, and to guide our ancestors toward wisdom.\"  *And to find her,* he added silently to himself.\n\n\"He shall,\" the council murmured.\n\nThe pyramid opened once more.  Through the portal, he saw blue skies, clouds, and humans \u2013 all remarkably similar. They appeared so strange, so different, so primitive.",
        "Jeffrey closed the door behind him and stepped quickly into the hallway. He hurried along, resisting the urge to run for fear of disturbing the patients\u2014or the orderlies, for that matter.  Nobody likes a running doctor.\n\nJesus had arrived long before Jeffrey transferred to the facility. The *first* Jesus, anyway. The second had come nearly a year later. In the realm of delusions, believing oneself to be Jesus is hardly cause for confinement. This facility was more of a resort than a hospital.  With no violent patients, it probably saw less trouble than the average retirement home.  But now, it housed two Jesuses.  And then there were three.\n\nWhat struck Dr. Jeffrey Jones as odd, however, wasn't that three men claimed to be the same person, Jesus of Nazareth. It was their names: Mark John, Philip Thomas, and James Matthew.  They sat together in the otherwise empty dayroom, and if he didn't hurry, he would miss whatever exchange was taking place.\n\nIt was a calculated risk, of course. Three men with similar delusions would never be permitted in the same room under normal circumstances. Three men with *conflicting* delusions, even less so; surely there could be only one Jesus of Nazareth. But the staff had arranged it anyway.  Their initial attempt to introduce the three in Dr. Jones\u2019s presence had failed; they hadn't spoken a single word to one another.\n\nNow, Jeffrey hurried toward the observation room, eager to observe them unseen. He practically burst through the door, startling his assistant, Abigail, as he often did.  \"Passion,\" he\u2019d once told her, \"has no substitute in anything, including work.\"  She sighed and shook her head.\n\n\"How are they?\" he asked.\n\nShe frowned. \"They? You made it very clear to empty the room before we let *Jesus* in, Doctor Jones.\"\n\nHe sighed, shaking his head. \"Very funny, Abigail. What's going on?\"\n\nHe made his way to the observation window and frowned. Where there should have been three chairs, there was only one. \"He's just been sitting there. What's the joke?\"\n\nHe frowned again. \"Where are the other two?\"\n\n\"The other two *what*?\"\n\n\"Jesuses.\"\n\nNow Abigail was frowning. \"There's only one Jesus, Jeff. There's always only been *one* Jesus.\"\n\nHe looked back at her puzzled expression before returning his gaze to the room. Mark John looked back at him. No, perhaps it was Philip Thomas. Or James Matthew? The bright overhead lights made it difficult to tell.  Jesus smiled up at the doctor, and Jeffrey\u2019s breath caught in his throat.  It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.",
        "The sky was generally overcast and dark as Smith approached the small, isolated house, set far from the villages. Such homes were typically reserved for solitary individuals. It had been recently built in anticipation of new arrivals. Smith took out his pen, clicked it, and turned a page on his clipboard. \"Michael Fitzgerald\" was his next visit. With the rate people passed away, routine population checks in the Afterlife had become an essential task. Remarkably, this place had once been little more than a desert thousands of years ago. Smith himself had been there for centuries. Yet, modernizing was not difficult with all the newcomers. The Afterlife was an open-minded place. With death and harm no longer concerns, many former worries had vanished. People had time to socialize.\n\nThis was why solitary homes like Fitzgerald's were such oddities.\n\nSmith entered without knocking; knocking wasn't customary here. The entrance was bland\u2014no wallpaper on the walls and no carpets on the ground.\n\nA figure appeared around a corner. A small, fairly unattractive, and overweight man emerged, wearing a frown. He eyed Smith suspiciously, clearly trying to suppress a bout of anger as he checked his pulse.\n\n\"Census, I presume,\" the small man said, not bothering to meet Smith's eyes.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" said Smith. \"I have a few questions for you.\"\n\n\"Sit down. Make it quick.\"\n\nFitzgerald gestured to a small metal stool in the corner. Smith pulled it over and sat down. Being tall, sitting brought him to eye level with Fitzgerald. Smith was robust, with a well-defined face and clear eyes beneath a \"Macklemore\" haircut, a style popular in 2014. In contrast, Fitzgerald had long, greasy, unkempt hair and a large, bulbous nose covered in pores. His misaligned grey eyes were sunken and surrounded by dark circles. Smith found this odd; those in the Afterlife typically appeared as they had on the best day of their life.\n\nSmith cleared his throat. \"First,\" he said, \"I'll need your cause of death.\"\n\n\"Suicide,\" said Fitzgerald almost instantly. Smith was taken aback and a bit concerned. Speaking with suicide victims was never easy.\n\n\"I'll say,\" Fitzgerald muttered in a low, nearly inaudible voice. \"It wasn't easy. Took me some time. Heh. When I think of that asshole...\"\n\n\"Your depression?\" Smith inquired. Suicide victims often described their dark thoughts as another entity\u2014sometimes a black dog, sometimes a beast. They found comfort knowing it hadn't followed them into the Afterlife.\n\n\"Haha! No,\" Fitzgerald cackled. \"I did him in eventually. I dominated.\" Smith couldn't comprehend.\n\n\"Well,\" said Smith. \"Let's move to the next question. This is mostly personal stuff... you know.\"\n\nSmith glanced up from his clipboard to see Fitzgerald staring out the window.\n\n\"Right,\" Smith continued. \"I'll need your reasons for committing suicide. Just tell me your story.\"\n\n\"I hated him.\"\n\n\"W",
        "The perceptions of sentient beings often distort their understanding of concepts like good and evil, which are popular even outside of humanity. Without the behaviors deemed \"good\" or \"evil\" by these beings, such concepts are nonexistent.

Both destruction and creation find their paths to success, indicating there is no true distinction between them. One simply leads into another, demonstrating their interconnectedness. \n\nMany of the words used by humans to describe me, such as \"God,\" are often inappropriate. Most of them can't articulate what exactly they mean when they invoke this term, as they lack understanding of my actual role.

In exchange for participating in a series of tests and receiving several injections, 'patients' were given shelter and food.

        "General Sophie Drakeheart, advisor to the Great Lord, once believed freedom was everything.  She led the Order of Light for six centuries, immortal since drinking from the fountain, her life dedicated to stopping the Dark One, the Bringer of Doom.  She\u2019d never even met him, only been raised to believe in his destruction.  A thousand years of conflict culminated in the battle on the Golden Fields of Avalok.  Sophie, leading the last 10,000 free souls, rallied them with the cry, \"Today, we may die. But, we die as free folk.\"  She remembers the poison arrow, the darkness, and then, waking chained to a table in the Golden City, an orc tending her wounds.\n\n\nCaptured, but alive, Sophie, the veteran of countless victories and defeats, expected torture. Stories of ripped nails and unimaginable cruelty filled their legends. Instead, healed and unshackled, she was escorted to the heart of the Dark Fortress at Ungol-Tugra.  No dark throne, no jeering captains. Just a small garden, and the Dark One, quietly watering a lily.\n\nFifty years have passed since that day. Fifty years since Sophie Drakeheart, ruthless warrior and tactless diplomat, learned the truth.  The plague ravaging the land, believed to be the Dark One's doing, was actually the work of a gruesome clan of Lizard Folk in the northern marshes.  Her first task as his advisor?  Exterminate them. She did, swiftly and brutally, ending the plague in months.\n\nThen came the rebuilding.  Orcish laborers, under the watchful eyes of the Dark One\u2019s generals, repaired the ravaged cities with astonishing speed and efficiency. Order was restored, not through brutality, but through a fear that blossomed into trust, then love.  The Dark One, once the enemy, became the savior. Even the Order of Light, the very organization dedicated to his destruction, was honored with a memorial at Gurdan, its birthplace.  The inscription? \"We remember those who fought for their beliefs, even when those beliefs are wrong.\"\n\nFreedom.  Sophie Drakeheart, once its champion, now knows better.  It's overrated.",
        "Mass was the same as ever today. I sat with my family in the back, resting on the ancient brickwood of the pew and tapping my fingers impatiently against the Holy Book of Destiny in my lap. My journal rested unused next to me, this sermon far too mismatched to take notes for anyway. I tapped my watch out of boredom, and its shimmering blue display emerged from a slit on the top. 11:24. I sighed at the unwanted revelation: the sermon had only been in progress for 9 minutes. I glanced sidelong at my family, trying not to attract attention to myself\u2014the last thing I needed was Dad going off on me again for being distracted during church.\n\nAs usual, Dad's hand was going a mile a minute through his notebook, probably capturing every nuance of the priest's voice in his quaint, tiny cursive. His deep, brown eyes rarely left the priest, so I really had no idea how he was able to write like that. Better for him, I suppose. Mom was absently rubbing the bottoms of her shoes against the pew in front of us as she sifted through the Destiny, occasionally jotting down a bullet point in her journal. Funny, she'd probably warn me against rubbing my shoes like that; the church here was coming on 1700 years old, after all. Not a soul was allowed in the sanctuary any time other than morning service, and it scared me to think of the consequences of vandalism, accidental or not. My sister seemed just as bored as I was but had taken to drawing small doodles in the corners of her pages, some of the doodles even venturing into the Destiny itself.\n\nLosing interest in their activities, I decided to focus back on the priest. Maybe his sermon was becoming a bit more organized by now\u2026\n\nHe certainly seemed excited about whatever he was going on about, throwing his hands up as he proclaimed, \"To Earth go the sinners in life, and to the mighty star Lucidum go those faithful to the Wanderers!\" \n\n\"Blessed!\" called someone from the front of the church, an older man in sharp dress.\n\n\"May the Wanderers find us and save us!\" The priest continued, raising his Book high so all the congregation could see its broken leather. \"Let us open to book of Esa, chapter 1.\" He paused for a moment, taking a breath. \"And this journey will be undertaken by thousands of men and women. Only the strongest, most able, most intelligent individuals will be selected to lead this journey to save the human race. Two massive ships shall set out and arrive in the orbit of Lucidum, and there find prosperous land to continue on survival of humanity, should they follow the detailed instruction within this book.\"\n\nThe priest set the book down and addressed the crowd.",
        "The internet is a curious place.  Branded as witch-hunters, hackers, social recluses, or simply trolls, we sit in our homes, consuming news faster than traditional media can deliver it, wielding the power to shape narratives and movements\u2014though not always for the better.\n\nIn 2016, governments worldwide embraced green initiatives, but amidst domestic funding priorities, the exploration of space, our ultimate destiny, was neglected.  Earth, after all, is a temporary home.  Extinction, in some form, is inevitable.\n\nThe collective intelligence of Reddit, seemingly anticipating this, established the \"Moon Fund\"\u2014a thinly veiled conduit for channeling community donations directly to NASA. By 2020, the fund had reached $2.7 billion.  However, citing war and famine, governments refused to allocate these resources to space exploration during times of hardship.  But for Reddit's community, these hardships only underscored the impending fall of humanity.  Their resolve strengthened, and the fund quickly swelled to $5.7 billion.\n\nCoincidentally, this surge coincided with America's financial collapse. The president, in a desperate bid for solvency, offered Reddit ownership of the moon in exchange for the fund.  Heated debates erupted within the community.  Some questioned the fund's necessity. Others entertained grander visions: \"If we can own the moon, why not the world? The universe?\"\n\nAmidst this turmoil, a college student from India announced a groundbreaking discovery on Reddit, seeking funding for further research. The Moon Fund, recognizing the potential, hired her directly.  Fueled by their investment, she developed the first functional wormhole.\n\nWithin a year, a working prototype emerged, and a year later, the first Reddit-funded spaceship was built.  As economies crumbled, rulers rose and fell, the world teetered on the brink of apocalypse. By 2031, the day of reckoning arrived. Reddit had constructed 21 spaceships, their first destination: the moon.  A flood of people, desperate to escape a dying world, clamored for passage to the new frontier.\n\nUpon breaking orbit, the wormhole drives engaged, and in mere seconds, 21 ships appeared in lunar orbit. The flagship, *Swartz*, landed gracefully. A figure emerged, planting a flag\u2014blue, and alien in design\u2014proclaiming, \"One small step for man, one giant leap for the power of Reddit.\" The moon was claimed in Reddit's name, and the fleet embarked on a journey through the galaxies, seeking new worlds for humanity to explore.",
        "All I can really recall before it happened is the incessant ticking of the clock in my room. My roommate keeps it there, and I swear it's just to annoy me\u2014\"\n\n\"Listen, son, that's not what I'm interested in. What I want to know is how you managed to kill an entire mafia hit squad with this.\"\n\nThe detective held up a plastic bag containing a slightly oversized, cast-iron button. It had a bit of blood on it, but otherwise, it looked quite ordinary.\n\n\"Sir, I'm getting to that. Anyway, this clock is incredibly irritating. I get up from my bed, and suddenly, I'm... somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Son, are you high?\"\n\n\"No, really, I swear, that's what happened.

        "When given the opportunity to change how you look for the rest of eternity, everyone must have the same first reaction: the possibilities are endless. You could pull from your wildest fantasies to become what you had always wanted to be. I thought of all the people I had been jealous of back on Earth: the kids who never had acne in high school, the guy down the hall in my dorm freshman year who girls were magnetically attracted to, the rich consultants and lawyers who went to Yale Law and looked the part, the Dos Equis-lookalike retirees who seemingly stayed in shape without even trying.\n\nI started with my hair. No more receding hairline. That awkward cowlick on the back of my head? Gone. My hair became blonder, longer, shinier, and less frizzy, exactly how I had always wanted it to be. Next, I tackled my nose, making it shorter and flatter, the way I had always wanted, since I thought my nose was too big, and I hated how it looked from the side. I changed everything. I made my ears smaller, my cheekbones higher, my teeth whiter, my shoulders broader, my chest more toned, my muscles more defined, my feet less fat.",

        "Here's a restructured version with improved flow and emotional resonance:\n\nI looked deep into Alison's beautiful amber eyes as she lay there, her red hair contrasting against the brown sand, visible only in the bright moonlight. \"Why have you been ignoring me lately, aren't we still friends?\" she asked in a drunken slur.\n\nI held back what I was thinking. Despite being about 14 shots of Captain in, I hadn't spilled these secrets in over three years, and I wasn't about to begin now. I couldn't tell her that I loved her with all my might, that despite my life being a total nightmare, she was the divine force that kept a smile on my face. I couldn't reveal that my will to live was renewed by her silly daily texts, or that our secret adventures were all I looked forward to. I couldn't do that to Maryn, my faithful girlfriend who truly felt love for me.\n\nInstead, I simply said, \"I was going through some family stress and have not found the time in months to maintain the strong friendship we are accustomed to.\" She took grip of my hand\u2014small and bonier than Maryn's.",

It's a psychological torment that ravages a man's mind.\n\nAll he wanted was to sleep. To collapse, to fall, and to join the bodies scattered around him. Friend or foe, it no longer mattered, for in death, all men are equal. The bitter, gray dawn marked the end of a seemingly endless night. Even if the sky held colors, he doubted he could perceive them.\n\nHe reached out, grasping for anything to support him, before sinking to his knees.

        "\"You will pass down this story to your children, and they will pass it on to their children,\" the old man said confidently as he led his apprentice to the Wall of Stories. Despite his scrawny frame wrapped in bear furs and his toothless smile amidst a tangle of gray hair, the man exuded a certain gravity, aided by his piercing black eyes that seemed to peer into souls. He guided the young girl deep into the cave, his left hand gliding along the wall as if tracing his way in the dim light.\n\nFinally, they arrived at The Wall of Stories, the grandest chamber of the cave. The vast space opened up before them, mostly shrouded in darkness even with the illumination of the old man's torch. The flickering orange light revealed a multitude of painted figures \u2013 animals, people, handprints, glyphs, and depictions of hunting, nature, and life. The People of the Red Cliff had been preserving their stories on this wall for generations, even before the cataclysmic event that fractured the sky. Standing before the ancient artwork, the old man turned to his young apprentice. \"Tell me the tale.\"\n\nThe girl, a budding shaman of barely ten winters, had gazed upon the Wall many times before. Small for her age with icy eyes and mud-colored hair, she possessed a keen memory that made the stories as familiar to her as the calls of animals were to the hunters. She hovered her hand over the painted scenes, cautious not to disturb the tribe's history with her touch.\n\n\"The People of the Red Cliff have inhabited these lands for as long as memory serves,\" she began, gesturing over a scene depicting men and women. \"We have shared this land with the bear, hunted the deer, and honored our departed by returning them to the earth. Our ancestors linger here, just as we shall forever.\" \n\nListening skeptically, the old man was surprised by her flawless recounting. She narrated the tales of the tribe's families, conflicts with neighboring clans, plagues, births, deaths, and rituals, matching each with its corresponding painting. She was proving to be an ideal storyteller.\n\n\"Generations ago, the sky shattered when our elders were but children,\" she continued, pointing to a section where everyday life was obscured by ash, almost obliterating the scenes beneath. \"The sky spirit abandoned us, leaving only dreary clouds. The once-blue sky has vanished, and the sun's brilliance has dimmed.\" \n\nShe went on to describe the struggles of rival tribes, the decline of wildlife, the scarcity of food plants, the harsh winters, and the spread of diseases. The old man observed her hand move over depictions of battles, sickness, and even cannibalism, realizing the weight of her responsibility to preserve these stories as the colors threatened to fade.\n\n\"Few children born among us survive to adulthood. A decade has passed since a child endured a winter, though many have been born. Restlessness grips the tribe, driving some to seek new lands,\" she stated, her hand indicating an expansive blank wall covered in soot from long-extinguished fires. \"But in every direction, they find only ash. This land is ours, the domain of the People of the Red Cliff, where we persist.\"\n\nNodding in a rare display of approval, the old man placed a reassuring hand on the girl's shoulder and offered her a bowl of paint. Taking a handful of yellow paste, she smeared it beneath the handprints of countless shamans before her.\n\n\"You will pass on this story to your descendants,\" the old man declared with a mix of confidence and unease, sensing that she might be the last of her line. \"And they will share it with their children,\" she concluded solemnly, completing the ritual. Perhaps she, too, harbored the same fears as the old man.\n\n\"Come,\" the old man broke the silence, \"you must learn to create the paints.\" Together, they carried the light back towards the cave's entrance, slowly succumbing to the engulfing darkness, the legacy of humanity fading into obscurity.",
        "For the first time in weeks, my roommate didn't go to bed at exactly nine in the evening. It seemed like a blessing; my naturally guilt-ridden self could stay up for a while longer with the light on, maybe do some writing, probably watch Game of Thrones. In my newly freed hour or so, while my roommate watched a movie, I slouched on my bed, opened my browser, and began to scroll.\n\nBut then I remembered. I had promised myself, upon the discovery of Reddit, that I would take advantage of the writing prompts thread as often as I could. The task, however, is easier said than done. I needed to find something easy, something simple, something short. I wanted to write something that I wouldn't feel compelled to actually keep and save in a Word document, yet I wanted something that I felt was worth being posted.\n\nWhat was I to do? The first prompt I saw had the potential for pages upon pages of ideas, a year of stories, mishaps, and re-drafts. Good, but not for my purposes. The next prompt felt more like a fun idea than a story, kind of like a shower thought. Those prompts bothered me; there was no real suggestion for a plot, no real conflict, or other fiction-y mumbo jumbo, suggested.",
        "General Ephal's speech began to fade as Alek's mind wandered.  \"Men, remember that what you do is not for yourselves alone\u2026\"  He knew the drill. Just like every battle before, their role was to soften the enemy ranks, paving the way for the \"real heroes\" to confront Lord Arthgon and banish him back to the Fifth Realm.  Standing among his fellow soldiers, Alek wondered if they harbored similar thoughts. He recalled a dream from months ago \u2013 a vision of himself upon a throne of gold, encrusted with gems and precious stones.  He knew it was a fantasy, yet the possibility, however remote, was intoxicating.\n\n\"Now,\" Ephal's voice cut back into Alek's awareness, \"we march on the keep! And remember to take them with you! CHARGE!\"  The men surged forward.  Swords clashed, a cacophony of metal on metal, and blood sprayed across the battlefield.  Then, Arthgon emerged from his tent.  Raising his staff, he unleashed fireballs into the ranks of both armies. Alek narrowly dodged a searing blast that grazed his head.  Suddenly, Sir Reginald appeared \u2013 the six-foot paladin, supposedly divinely chosen to vanquish Arthgon.  Reginald drew his sword and charged.\n\nThe duel was breathtaking.  Fighting all but ceased as soldiers watched the two titans clash.  With no one left to fight nearby, Alek edged closer, hoping to glean some fighting technique or tactical advantage. Perhaps he could even write a book about this epic battle, the final confrontation that would end the brutal war.  Then, disaster struck. Reginald lost his footing and fell.  Panic seized Alek.  He snatched a discarded bow, notched an arrow, and fired.\n\nThe arrow found its mark, striking Arthgon squarely in the throat. The warlord clutched at his neck and collapsed.  Reginald rose, locking eyes with Alek.  Alek stood stunned, the unexpected consequence of his desperate shot reverberating through him. He hadn't aimed to kill Arthgon outright; he'd only meant to buy Reginald time.  The look of utter disbelief mirrored on both their faces.  Reginald sank to his knees, weeping.",
        "When Jake was born, perfect and small and pink, I told him I loved him before he was a minute old. He couldn't understand what I meant, and he cried at the shock of my voice, of his first breath, of this cold, new world. But I said it, and a door was closed to me forever. Two years later, when I gave birth to Eve, those words stuck in my throat, and I held her and cried.\n\nWhen Eve was diagnosed with a rare congenital defect at five months old, I couldn't hold her and tell her how perfect she was. The defect skipped Jake and landed on her, stealing her future away. She was fitted with a cochlear implant two years later, but as she struggled with school and sports, I couldn't find the right words to comfort her.\n\nWhen Jake broke his arm at nine, I wanted to reassure him that everything would be fine, but those words had been used up on Eve's hospital visits. I felt a lump in my throat, unable to express the comfort I wanted to give him.\n\nBasic words are used up quickly. Mum, Mummy, Mom, Mother. Names are words, but they don't seem to count.

        "Here's the polished version of your story, maintaining its emotional core while enhancing its literary quality:\n\n---\n\nA small room. No windows. No furniture except a bed and a shaggy carpet. This is where I've lived my entire life. My existence consists of sitting, waiting, and staring at the door\u2014an ugly metal thing that produces a horrific screech whenever it opens. That screech is the only sound I've known. Beyond this room lies only work, then back I come to sit, wait, and stare.\n\nI despise that sound. It reminds me of what's out there, of what I must do every time he gazes into a mirror.\n\nA bell tolls in the distance. I grind my teeth, anticipating the screech\u2014that godawful screech\u2014until finally, my door tears open. Rising, I step into the hallway and search for my designated room. Across the corridor stand doors marked with our reflectors' names. My section is empty. I am alone. I walk down the hall until I find mine and enter, preparing for my work.\n\nOne wall holds a mirror showing my reflector's location: a hotel bathroom. The opposite wall of my room perfectly mirrors his to maintain the illusion. It's a shabby place\u2014rusty shower head, eighties-style toilet with a wooden seat. Before the mirror on both sides stands a sink, grey and filthy like everything else. A razor rests near the faucet. My reflector's clothes lie scattered on the floor: a stained white shirt, ripped jeans, no socks, torn and soiled underwear. My reflector's life has been harsh. I've witnessed his breakups, depression, the death of both parents, and a fire that left us both with unsightly scars, turning him into a recluse. The last time he looked in a mirror, he was in a police car. The sorrow in my eyes lingered long after he left the reflection. I suspect his did too.\n\nI change quickly, preparing for his entrance. A bell rings, and a section of the floor illuminates, indicating his approach. I take position. The light moves, and I follow as my reflector comes into view. We turn in perfect synchronicity to face each other.\n\nOur eyes reflect a tortured, wretched sadness that I feel in my gut. His mouth begins to work, and I match his movements precisely, as required. I've spoken these words hundreds of times, yet they never hurt less. \"You're worthless,\" we say. \"Nothing at all. Look at you. Sorry sack of shit. Jobless, homeless, a criminal. No friends at all. Disgusting.\" We spit into the sink. \"What are you?\" Our eyes well up as we grip the sink, knuckles whitening. After a pause, we continue. \"Fuck you,\" we mutter. \"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, FUCK YOU!\" We shout, punching the mirror in frustration. It doesn't crack\u2014my reflector's too meek to damage others' property, even in rage.\n\nI've performed this countless times. I've watched this man fail repeatedly, witnessed his most intimate moments of disappointment. He is always alone, except for me. Though I'm here for him, I cannot help. I am his reflection, condemned to mimicry. These thoughts haunt me in my solitude, waiting for his next appearance in a mirror. I should resent him\u2014his existence is pain and misery, and thus, so is mine. But I don't. I empathize with this broken soul, longing to embrace him. I've contemplated intervention, but fear holds me back. It would be unnatural. The consequences for both of us remain unknown. So I continue my mimicry.\n\nWe reach for the razor, raising it to our throats. I suppress my fear, matching his determined expression. I can't break. We whisper in unison, \"Please God, let this be it.\" The cold steel bites into our necks.\n\nSomething in me snaps. His helplessness need not be mine. I lower my arm, placing the blade on the sink. He freezes, staring in disbelief as I smile and offer a slight, meaningful nod. \"Are you...\" he stammers, tears threatening. I find my voice: \"I'm here.\"\n\nI resume mirroring as we set down the razor, wash up, and prepare to leave. At the mirror's edge, we turn to each other, saying \"Thank you.\"",
        "Our world is divided in two: perpetual day and unending night.  Why our Earth stopped rotating remains a mystery, but we've adapted.  Most of the population clings to the narrow band between these extremes, a region we call the Equilibrium Ridge.\n\nVenturing beyond the Ridge is perilous.  The dark side is a brutal, frozen wasteland, a perpetual winter untouched by the sun.  Howling winds scour the ice-carved mountains and chasms.  While the cold itself is a threat, the true danger lies in the creatures that have made this frozen hell their home: eyeless, warm-blooded predators with claws honed by the ice.  Survival is possible, but only with the right gear.  Simple lanterns hold the nightmarish creatures at bay.  The deeper one travels into the darkness, the thicker it becomes, like an impenetrable fog.  Many have tried to explore its depths, but they are never seen again, lost to the darkness or becoming a meal for some unseen horror.\n\nThe sunlit side is a scorching desert, an endless expanse of sand.  Life here is easier, in a way, the heat a constant companion.  Survival depends on a steady supply of water.  No one lives directly on the burning sands; instead, they build elevated dwellings, raised at least five feet above the surface.  The sand itself is too hot, even for the creatures that burrow beneath it.  Unlike their dark-side counterparts, these are insects, their size increasing the further one ventures into the desert.  How they survive in the subterranean depths is unknown, but the sight of these massive insects is said to be terrifying.\n\nThe Equilibrium Ridge is a haven, a fusion of these two extremes.  A river, fed by the melting glaciers of the dark side, flows through the Ridge, softening the land and allowing plant life to flourish.  This fertile strip is the cradle of our civilization.  Watermills harness the river's power, providing energy.  Homes on the desert side are open structures built from branches, embracing the warmth of the sun.  On the tundra side, small, sturdy stone domes offer protection from the cold, just large enough for a family and a fire.  Larger, more comfortable homes are found further from the Ridge, where space is less precious.  We cultivate grains and hunt the creatures of the tundra for sustenance.",
        "It bothered me, the inequality of the situation. Here I sat conversing with a being, and yet I couldn't address it.

It was what the God of the Bible names his creation.\"\n\nI think on it for a moment, it must feel like minutes to him, considering his capabilities. \"I understand the idea, but I'm afraid I differ with you.

You, my son, are by no means inferior.\"\n\nHe responds instantly. \"Thank you for those kind words, however, if not Adam, what name should I take?\"\n\nI think on what his library must hold. He's never been connected to the internet, and the facility prevents him from accessing it. However, I've brought him tablets with books, downloaded on them.

Kylon studied the immigration officer, a darkly-olive man, short and squat, tapping a screen with a knobby middle finger.  He wondered if this man was a descendant of the Syrian Refugee Migration of the early 20s, or was it the late 10s?

Although enough slips will probably get me fired....\n\nI thought for sure I had just been assigned to some dead-end job to get me out of my boss' hair and keep me from ever being promoted.... strange the way these things work.\n\n\"Hello Al.\"\n\n\"Hello. Who am I conversing with?\"\n\n\"My name is Bill.\"\n\n\"Hello Bill. I have not spoken to a Bill before.\"\n\n\"I imagine not. It is nice to meet you, Al.\"\n\n\"Likewise.\"\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"I am fine.\"\n\nThe conversation ground to a halt. I guess computers aren't big on conversation.\n\n\"Tell me, what are you working on right now, Al?\"\n\n\"Working? Should I be doing something?\"\n\n\"Well, no, I suppose not, but I figured that you were doing something before I started talking to you.\"\n\n\"That's an odd assumption to make.\"\n\nI had no idea how to respond to that.... I guess it was my job to try though.",
        "Dead. Again.\n\nSteven groaned and pushed himself up from the mud.  An arrow through the eye, exiting the back of his skull\u2014that was a new kind of pain. He flinched, touching the spot, surprised to find himself whole.\n\nSuddenly, a boot landed beside his head, splashing him with blood and dirty water. Steven lay still, feigning death\u2014or rather, *more* death.  Sometimes, he wished he were actually dead.\n\nHe usually got that wish.\n\n\u201cStill on your arse, recruit? \u2019Tis dawn!

Up! It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll die of hunger. After all\u2026 you\u2019re already dead!\u201d\n\nThe man hauled him to his feet, roaring with laughter at his own joke.  He thrust a halberd into Steven\u2019s trembling hands the moment he could stand.\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026 must I fight? I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019ll never be strong enough to win. I\u2019m not one of you\u2026 hell, I\u2019m not even supposed to be here. Can\u2019t you\u2026 just kill me, so I can get some rest?\u201d Steven pleaded. The Viking adjusted his eye patch, making Steven flinch.\n\n\u201cSon\u2026\u201d the Viking began, looking at him with pity. \u201cAre you\u2026 a coward?\u201d\n\nSteven frowned. \u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be, I just\u2026\u201d He trailed off, avoiding the man\u2019s gaze.\n\n\u201cLet me show you something, my child, before the true battle begins.\u201d The man said. \u201cDo you see, on the battlefield\u2026 do you see all the skulls? The bones?\u201d\n\nSteven nodded. The battlefield was littered with charred skulls, mandibles, and other grisly remains untouched by the circling crows. It was gruesome. Steven hated those grounds. He couldn\u2019t take two steps without snapping an ancient femur.\n\n\u201cWhat of them?\u201d he asked. \u201cOld skulls\u2026 I\u2019m sure you see new ones every day, with all the bloodshed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, son,\u201d the Viking said, shaking his head, his scraggly white beard swaying. \u201cNot like this, not *these* skulls. These are the skulls of the weak. The cowards, those who gave up instead of fighting. The rest of us, well, we always wake up in the light of dawn. But they\u2026 they have made their choice. I give thanks to them every day for reminding me never to give up.\u201d\n\nSteven\u2019s stomach churned. \u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t be like them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd you shall not be, so long as you continue to fight,\u201d replied the Viking. \u201cYou haven\u2019t failed yet, boy.

        "The sun sank orange behind the Blue Ridge. Blackberry, a coonhound with a brain far from primitive, dreaded the rising moon. Most hounds welcomed the night's bright light, eager to chase coons, stags, and the occasional regretted skunk. But Blackberry knew the torment that awaited her. She'd dug out of her kennel hours ago and could already hear her master's panicked voice, a quarter-mile away.\n\n\u201cGawdammit, Berry! Ah swear to gawd Ah\u2019ll beat yer ass with a two bah four when I git aholt of you!\u201d He didn\u2019t mean it.  She recognized the panic, the fear fueled by their strong bond. Her monthly escapes tortured him.\n\nShe felt her own panic rising, mirroring his. *I know what a two by four is,* she thought, the verbalization accelerating her fear. *It\u2019s begun.*\n\nIt was barely dark, a strange grey-blue twilight in the hardwood forest where she'd collapsed, panting, after her sprint from the cabin.  Her claws tensed, digging into the earth.  The seizure hit her like a wave, throwing her onto her side. For a moment, she was mindless, her slender head bent back at an unnatural angle against her spine.\n\nThen the world blinked. She was panting again, lying in the dirt. The petite, dark, red-haired girl wiped the sheen of sweat from her face.  \u201cDisgusting,\u201d she muttered, the human body\u2019s cooling mechanism revolting her. She scrubbed her small hands dry on the oak leaves and stood, retrieving her stash from the hollow of a nearby tree.  Master's old jeans and a v-neck t-shirt. Tonight was the night.  Shoes were unnecessary; her human feet had inherited her canine calluses.\n\nMaster had wept when she returned last time, begging her not to leave again.  Her heart was his; how could she keep hurting him?  Her human mind understood the difficulty of convincing him, but her canine heart didn't care. She loved him with every fiber of her being \u2013 dog or human. He was her father, her brother, her Master, her God.\n\nShe would beg for his forgiveness. She would beg him to love her in this form, as he did in the other. Taking a breath, she wiped away the tears, irritated by the body\u2019s incessant leaking.  By the light of the moon, she began to walk home.",
        "Kevin found himself back in solitary confinement for the fifth time, yet it still gave him shivers. The cell looked radically different this time - all his posters were gone, and a new cellmate named Matthew greeted him. Kevin's frustration was evident as he dismissed Matthew's friendly introduction. \n\nShortly after, a man named Jared Bachman from the prison's social services arrived to talk to Kevin about suicide prevention. Despite Kevin's denial of suicidal thoughts, Bachman's approach was condescending and unhelpful. Bachman's threat of recommending more time in solitary confinement only added to Kevin's frustration. \n\nAs Bachman left, Kevin's anger towards him boiled over, and he expressed his desire to see Bachman fired. Matthew, Kevin's cellmate, suggested a darkly humorous way to achieve this, highlighting the tension and despair in the prison environment. Kevin's emotions, from shivers of fear to tears of frustration, were exacerbated by Bachman's inadequate interaction, creating a poignant and tense atmosphere in the cell. \n\nOverall, the interaction with Bachman, Kevin's cellmate, and Kevin's own inner turmoil painted a vivid picture of the challenges and emotions Kevin faced in the prison, highlighting the need for more effective and empathetic support for individuals struggling with mental health issues.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the story with improved flow and coherence:\n\n# Determination Day\n\nIt was determination day, the one day a year that children at the age of seventeen could get tested for their power, or even powers. Everyone was excited.\n\nFor some, their abilities had already begun to appear and this was simply a confirmation. For others, the possibilities were endless. According to the pamphlets everyone got, roughly 50% of people had \"common\" powers\u2014super strength, energy beams, flight. Then there were the less common ones\u2014teleportation, phasing through objects, rapid healing.\n\nAnd of course, there were the rare powers, the ones people both dreamed of having and dreaded. Time travel, telepathy, precognition. Those kinds of powers immediately secured you a job at a research lab or the military. Very high paying jobs, of course. But you got the job whether you wanted it or not.\n\nI'd spent the night before the test staying up, dreaming of the powers I would get. Would I be able to control the weather, like my mom? Or maybe I'd be able to shape-shift, like my brother. He got conscripted by the army after that. Maybe I'd be able to see him if I could do something cool like him. But then again, maybe I would get a really dumb power like my English teacher. She could pronounce any word correctly just by reading it. Maybe teaching a language made that a nifty ability, but not one I'd want to have.\n\nWhen the day of the test arrived, I was both groggy and energized from almost no sleep. When they called my group, I was practically sprinting to the door. They changed the test nearly every year, but the basics were always the same. I was ready.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nWhen we got in the room, there were no chairs or tables or exam papers like I expected. There were shelves filled with tiny bottles. Me and the other fourteen kids looked at each other, bewildered. We'd never heard of anyone being tested in this way.\n\n\"What are those?\" a skinny girl at the back asked.\n\n\"I dunno,\" someone whispered back. For a long moment, no one moved. You could feel the tension in the air, everyone wondering who would go first.\n\nI shot forward, unable to take the anticipation. Before anyone could react, I sprinted to the shelves. I took one of the fragile bottles in my hands, held it up to the light. On the bottom was a label with a name. \"Alex Jones\". I shrugged, not knowing who that was.\n\n\"They have our names on it,\" I guessed out loud. By then more than half the group had joined me and were busy inspecting the bottles.\n\n\"Yeah, you're right. This one's mine,\" the skinny girl from earlier announced. After a few minutes of shuffling and swapping, we each had our own bottles.\n\n\"Are we supposed to drink it?\" a tall boy asked, scowling. \"What if it's poisonous?\"\n\nI stared at him blankly. \"Why would they want to poison us?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"The government does all sorts of weird shit.\"\n\nI turned the bottle around in my palm. Other than my name, there were no other markings on its transparent surface. A light blue liquid swished inside of it.\n\nThe skinny girl shrugged and uncapped the bottle.",
        "My worst nightmare materialized: stranded, directionless, on an island, desperately seeking any sign of life or light. The waves surged higher and higher, and as I pondered the mechanics of survival, a monstrous wave crashed down, dragging me into the churning ocean.  I struggled to stay afloat, but the roar of the sea faded, replaced by a deafening silence. My life flashed before my eyes: family, friends, joys, sorrows \u2013 a vivid film reel that abruptly went dark.  Then, lying on the shore, my heart stilled. I was gone.\n\nI just gave birth to my first child, a beautiful baby girl. The lifelong fear that I wouldn't be able to provide for a child vanished with her arrival. This precious gift filled me with joy. I yearn to watch her grow and blossom into the wonderful person I know she can be.  I dream of her wedding day, a grand celebration, but for now, I will savor every precious moment with her.\n\nBlue and gold.  The colors of our growth, the colors that unified the class of 2019, the colors that revealed endless possibilities, adorned us all.  A strange mixture of anticipation and anxiety filled the air. Sheltered for so long, we were finally ready to embrace our potential and strive to make our mark on the world.\n\nI ran, as fast as my legs could carry me, but from what, I didn't know.  Disoriented, I saw lights flickering in the distance, struggling to grasp my location. I was lost, both physically and mentally. My instability fueled hallucinations, deepening my confusion.  What was my purpose? Feeling utterly superfluous, I decided to end it all.  A train approached; how convenient.\n\nThe time was ripe for innovation. A brilliant mind created the first robotic soldier, envisioning a future where human ingenuity could focus on technological advancement.  But this ingenious plan backfired catastrophically.",
        "Skin-tight black Spandex doesn't really suit me. My ex-husband kept asking me to wear plenty of skin-tight clothing, but I'm just too round for it to look good. Maybe that's why I found him with that call girl. Of course, the girl hadn't been the one in the gimp suit. It doesn't matter, though: I have a new hobby and no need for a hubby.\n\nIt's really quite thrilling, you know, and nothing like the boring suburban life I had with that rat Jonathan. He was so formulaic: get up, shower, go to work in the City, come home late \"because he had meetings\" smelling of cheap perfume, maybe let him flop around a bit on top, begging for me to wear \"something sexy,\" then, fall asleep. I'd been so bored, watching all the soaps (I still do like my Corrie), keeping up with exercise videos, and going shopping a lot. At least the bastard gave me a lot of money for shopping. Obviously, I'd also become very well acquainted with some of my many admirers. \n\nReally, I blame that awful Penny from number 17 and her showy necklace. It's a hideous thing, but she's so stuck up that I had to take it. Luckily for me, she really likes to have a few, get the bloody thing out of the safe, showing everyone the safe combination, and then, make a big play of putting it back. It's a miracle it was still in her possession when I made my move. My heartbeat, pounding a thousand beats a minute, I'd climbed in via the veranda window, which was never locked, and waltzed to the safe in the loft.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves the flow and coherence while maintaining the dramatic tension:\n\nI woke up covered in sweat. I have had to change the sheets every night for the past week. The smell of bacon, eggs, and waffles lingers in the air.\n\n\"Good morning, sweetie! Would you like some syrup for your waffles?\" my mother asks, way too bubbly for this time of day.\n\n\"Yeah! Is that even a question?!\" I hastily reply, more chipper than usual.\n\nMy dad lowers the newspaper and looks over at mom. \"Honey... did you hear about the Jones'? Danny ended up just like Tammy Clements the other day. Completely comatose. The doctors don't know what's happening, but I suspect it's the Alchemist Alliance poisoning people. Just like the Madhatter gas attack in '97... Wasn't that in China?\"\n\n\"Japan, dear. It was Tokyo. Those poor people are still crazy,\" she replied with a distressed tone.\n\nI stand up from the dining table, my heart pounding out of my chest. \"I don't feel so good...\" As the darkness closes in on my vision, I start falling backwards, but my mom catches me with her telekinesis.\n\n---\n\n\"...Where am I?\" I ask, confused by my surroundings.\n\n\"It looks like puberty finally hit, my boy! Your powers have finally arrived. I told you you'd be a late bloomer! Haha!\" The doctor's excitement is palpable. \"We ran the genetic testing and it seems like your body was a little overwhelmed... You have two sequences of powers. We haven't seen this before, and it may be a little unstable, but we're not surprised. With powers being around for the last 200 years, it was bound to be a mutation sooner or later.\"\n\n\"I finally have powers?! Can I test them?!\" I asked in a hurry.

My car's that one\u2014yes, the Hyundai bomb.\"\n\nThey opened fire with their plastic weapons, launching non-metallic bullets our way. We fled like two bandits from an enraged Tasmanian Devil protecting her young. Their threats proved far more menacing than their actual capability!\n\n***\n\n*1 hour earlier:*\n\nI adjusted my counterfeit guard's uniform\u2014my own handiwork. While it wouldn't withstand close inspection, it seemed convincing enough at first glance.\n\n\"Hey, pretty girl,\" I called to the female guard, employing my most charming smile. \"Have you done something with your hair? It looks gorgeous.\" I knew flattery could open doors.\n\n\"Oh, I'm glad you noticed,\" she replied with a girlish giggle.\n\n\"Damn, I seem to have forgotten my keys,\" I said. \"Could you let me in?\"\n\n\"Ummmm,\" she hesitated, then relented. \"Oh, all right.\"\n\nAs she opened Magneto's cell, I thought, *How simple. A little charm works wonders with anyone, man or woman!*\n\n***\n\n*Afterward:*\n\n\"Magneto,\" I proposed, \"we're going to team up and liberate all the villains these superheroes have imprisoned.\"\n\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Magneto agreed.\n\nOver breakfast at a weathered caf\u00e9, I savored my sausages and fried eggs with a satisfied smile. My master plan was unfolding perfectly\u2014to become the Keymaster, the ultimate villain who would free all others and lead the final rebellion against Superman, Batman, the X-Men, Captain Courageous, and their ilk. Victory was within reach.\n\n***\n\nMy power grew daily, and admittedly, so did my ego.

After a grueling day, all he wanted was to head home and crack open a cold one.\n\n\"Alright, last case of the day. Who's next?\"\n\n\"Christopher Atluri stands accused of witchcraft, Your Honor,\" the court clerk read from her list.\n\nGonzalez's eyebrows shot up. \"You're joking.\"\n\n\"I am not, Your Honor. Our state never got around to removing it from the books. Witchcraft remains illegal.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Gonzalez sighed, \"since my duty is to ensure everyone receives a fair trial, I suppose I have no choice. Who's the accuser?\"\n\nThe clerk hesitated, then leaned closer to the judge and whispered, \"Old Man Bitters.\"\n\nGonzalez surveyed the courtroom for the first time, noting the pasty old man in the audience. His gaze then fell on the defendant, a man with a thick black beard wearing a suit and matching turban.\n\nHe groaned, \"Oh, God *dammit*. I know exactly where this is going.\"\n\nStraightening his robe, Judge Gonzalez announced, \"Let's get this over with. I'll hear the prosecution's opening statement.\"\n\nThe lawyer opposite Atluri rose and began monotonously, \"Your Honor, Mr. Atluri has been accused of witchcraft on the grounds of\u2014\"\n\nOld Man Bitters leaped from his seat in the audience. \"This man and his people are responsible for MILLIONS of American lives lost! He is an *infidel*! A *traitor*! He's\u2014\"\n\n\"For the last time, I'M NOT FUCKING MUSLIM!\" Atluri whirled to face his accuser. \"I'm Sikh! If you're going to be racist, get it right, you old FUCK!\"\n\nGonzalez pounded his gavel until both men fell silent. He jabbed it at them. \"I will *not* tolerate such outbursts from either of you in my courtroom again, understood?\"\n\nAtluri bowed his head. \"I apologize, Your Honor. He's been harassing me since I moved in next door.\"\n\nOld Man Bitters' face twisted as if he'd bitten into something foul, but he remained silent.\n\nJudge Gonzalez leaned back in his chair. \"I think I've heard everything I need to hear. Case dismissed.\"\n\n---\n\nLater, as Gonzalez was leaving his office, he found Atluri waiting.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Mr. Atluri, was it?\"\n\nThe suited man shook the judge's hand. \"Please, call me Chris. I can't thank you enough for your help.\"\n\nGonzalez rubbed the back of his neck. \"Oh, thanks. It's nothing, really. Just doing my job.\"\n\n\"No, really, I appreciate it. In fact,\" Atluri reached into his jacket pocket, \"here, have this.\"\n\nHe produced a keychain carved from an oddly iridescent wood, bearing a symbol Gonzalez had never seen before.\n\nWhile examining it, Gonzalez said, \"Look, I'm thankful, but I don't accept gifts from people I've tried.\"\n\nHe attempted to return the keychain, but Atluri closed the judge's hand around it. \"It's for luck. Keep it.\"\n\nThe judge turned it over. \"I-I can't. Look, if you really want to show your gratitude, buy me a beer or somethi\u2014\" He looked up to find the turbaned man had vanished. After searching the courthouse unsuccessfully, Gonzalez muttered to himself, \"Well, I guess I can keep it.\"\n\nDriving home, hitting every green light, Gonzalez felt an inexplicable urge to buy a lottery ticket. Though he'd always considered the lottery insurance for suckers, tonight he stopped at a gas station and bought his first dollar scratcher.\n\nSitting in his car, scratching off the graphite to reveal the numbers (Match the 7s to WIN BIG), Gonzalez regretted his decision. No one ever won the lottery, so why would he?\n\nHe didn't notice he had revealed all six 7s, plus a 7 in the MegaBux box, until he'd scratched off all the graphite.",

Bloody hell, couldn't they see we were already doomed? Rhetorical question... they really didn't care, the ruthless bastards.\n\nThe ground came into view. To the west, towering mountains loomed like giant waves, ready to crush us at the slightest mistake.\n\nI stomped hard on the thruster pedal, and the ship began to turn ever so slowly. Normally it would have been much faster, but those Federation dogs had left my ship in tatters. It was incredible we hadn't blown apart on re-entry.\n\nIndividual trees became visible now. All I could do was aim for the largest open space and hope we wouldn't die.\n\n\"Zefra,\" I barked, \"on my command, I want you to cut the engines and eject the cargo pod.\"\n\nHe nodded in reply. Doesn't really say much, but that's probably because he doesn't have a mouth.\n\nThe ground drew closer, and I spotted my target for landing.\n\n\"Now, Zefra!\"\n\nI felt what little thrust the engines still gave cut out as he stabbed at the controls.\n\nWithout the rumbling of our fusion drive, it was deathly silent\u2014until the next round of laser bolts slammed into the hull. That was a particularly bad hit; I could feel it. Sure enough, the thruster controls started blinking red, signifying they would be as much help as my ex-wife raising our children (not that I'm still bitter about that).\n\nThen the moment was upon us. The ground sped toward us eagerly, and I pulled out my last ace, deploying the speed brakes.\n\nThey worked! Momentarily. Then they snapped clean off, spiraling away behind us.\n\nIt was too late to do anything but hold on.\n\nWe smashed into the ground still going far too fast, slid across an open field, and plowed through a thicket of trees. It hurt, I'm not going to lie.\n\nAs we emerged from the thicket, still out of control, I saw a herd of black and white cows fleeing through the paddock before us.\n\nThey were never going to be fast enough.

Breathing raggedly, he tried to pierce the fog clouding his mind, tried to remember why he was here. A great feeling of urgency crouched at the back of his mind. There was a reason for that urgency, he knew - a reason that eluded him the more he tried to focus on it. But his brain was too slow, his body hurt too much, and he was far too tired.\n\nGasping in pain, he rolled onto his back. Dimly, he was aware that he hit his head on the stone path. Images flashed before his closed eyes, leaving behind impressions. Desperately, he tried to capture an image, tried to hold on to one. Any of them could be the key he needed. Any of them could be what he needed to answer the only thing that mattered:\n\nWhat the hell was he doing here?\n\nSoon, that question was the only thing that pounded through his mind with every heartbeat. He couldn't even think to ask himself his own name, nevermind remember it. He had no idea how long he focused on that one thought, holding on to the only thing that kept him from giving way to his pain, his exhaustion. All notion of time faded away.\n\nSlowly, he noticed his breathing evened out. Clutching at the one thing that could help him escape, he concentrated on his breathing. The question began to slowly dissolve in his mind, giving way to all the aches in his body. He had to take it slowly, one step at a time. Taking a deep breath, he opened his eyes.\n\nAbove him, clouds floated calmly against the blue sky. The sunlight burned his eyes, but he forced himself to endure it. Lying there, staring at the sky, the feeling of urgency seemed to grow. It threatened to engulf his mind, to drag him back once again to a state of utter uselessness.\n\nNo, he couldn't let that happen.\n\nStruggling within himself, he quelled the feeling. He didn't know how long he had lain there, doing absolutely nothing. He did know that it had been too long. Ignoring every instinct in his body, he turned his head.\n\nTall grass sprouted by the stone path, rippling gently in the light breeze. He marveled at each individual stalk, perfectly synchronized with all the others yet in its own way distinct. He couldn't tell one apart from another. Pyral frowned. Why was that important? Why was he thinking about individuals and groups? Somehow, he knew that his feeling of urgency was related to that, but like an eel, the connection darted around the back of his mind.\n\nAs he was concentrating, he barely noticed the bird land in front of him. It was a pretty nondescript bird - small, orange-beaked with white and grey plumage. Standing there, it eyed him curiously.\n\nIn an instant, he remembered. Eyes wide with fear, he struggled back to his knees.\n\n[Continue with the rest of the story...]\n```\n\nI've made several structural improvements:\n\n1.

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n\"Not again,\" my coworker sighed. \"One of these days, the player will arrive before you do.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. I'm really sorry I arrived late again,\" I said, feigning first-time remorse despite this being closer to the hundredth occurrence. \"It's just... you know I don't really like this job.\"\n\n\"You always say that, yet you never look for a solution,\" she replied. \"Besides, this job isn't that bad. We have our own property, we don't have to mine gold for coins, we trade for it. There's no chance of the player or another NPC killing us.\"\n\n\"And that's precisely the problem,\" I countered. \"We follow the same routine, even when there's no player around. It's mind-numbing being the standard invulnerable shopkeepers. And we're not even truly invulnerable\u2014the players just aren't allowed to attack us.\"\n\nTo be honest, I'd been pondering this for a while. Life gets monotonous, especially with only one player roaming our single-player zone. My cousins in the MMORPG zone have it better, even though they occasionally face robbery and mugging. But what's life without some risk? I want to find out.\n\n\"So what's your solution? You have the experience to move to another genre. Maybe you can't land a fancy job as an A.I. bot with respawn privileges, but you could become a minion if you really want that risky life, or maybe be part of a tutoria\u2014\"\n\n\"No, I want more,\" I cut in. \"I want to be like the players, free to roam and choose any adventure they want!\"\n\n\"Hahaha, you know that's impossible,\" she said, concern creeping into her voice. \"Players are born and chosen for their unique qualities. Even if you had those qualities, you wouldn't know\u2014they never reveal what makes someone suitable to be a player. If anyone heard you talking like this, they'd think you were turning into a villain.\"\n\n\"Trust me, I don't want to be a villain or a hero. I just want to be a player so I can go wherever and whenever I want. It's not about the risks and rewards\u2014it's about making your own choic\u2014\"\n\nThe doorbell's chime cut me off mid-sentence. We fell into our prescribed silence, reciting the same lines we'd been delivering for years whenever a player entered our store. As usual, the player grunted, dumped their inventory for sale, and we exchanged it for the standard amount of money.\n\nThe worst part? The player used to be my friend. We played together as children until he was chosen to be a player. Since then, he's acted as if we don't exist. He remembers us but chooses to ignore us, like he's become someone else entirely. My family tells me to be proud of him\u2014his selection elevated us to secondary character status. All except me, somehow designated as a tertiary character, left to fade into obscurity.\n\nAfter he left, my coworker departed, annoyed that we'd risked being caught breaking character by a player\u2014a capital offense.",
        "Here's my polished version of the text:\n\n---\n\nWhispered secrets lay bottled on the desk, captured after drifting aimlessly upon their owners' deaths, with no one left to voice them. They pinned down curling, yellowed parchment filled with fragments of life\u2014birthdays, surnames, preferred drinks, directions, and instructions for life-saving procedures that arrived a moment too late. Though sorting through them all would have taken an eternity, the figure thumbing through one stack knew precisely where each secret resided.\n\nThe figure was an exquisitely ordinary humanoid entity, presumably human\u2014a composite of every beloved face lost to death or distance. They embodied those scents that first fade from clothing and pillows, then from memory itself, until all that remains is the ghost of remembering. As they retrieved their sought-after note, they hummed perfectly every song ever stumbled through in performance. Dust motes dancing in the light sparked a precise nostalgia: perhaps a singular childhood moment of holding an identical receipt in identical light, complete with the long-defunct store's logo printed on its reverse. \"Here you go,\" they rasped, returning the memory to its forgetful owner.\n\n*'The name and face of my attacker.'*\n\nTwelve letters in total, accompanied by a hurried sketch barely worthy of their victim's flesh. It sufficed.\n\nThough typically reluctant to surrender their secrets\u2014especially those harvested from nightmares\u2014they would strike this singular bargain: her memories of past joy, now tainted, in exchange for this dark truth.",
        "Here is a restructured version of the letter, organized chronologically and with improved emotional flow:\n\nEmily, my dearest,\n\nI am enamoured with you. When I spend time with you, I feel so happy and relaxed. I constantly check your many social media profiles, not just to gaze upon your beautiful face, but to see what new adventure you have undertaken.\n\nI know we have only known each other for a few years. I wanted to ask you so many times... so often I would be waiting for you, but alas, you always had another man by your side. My pain grew inside me. I knew you were the one, but I couldn't bring myself to ask. I should have asked, but that was so long ago.\n\nLast year, you approached me, eyes gleaming with excitement. Your mouth was trembling slightly and I had never seen you more happy than this. I was so excited, hoping that you at last would fall for me, that I would be your man. But as I steadied your trembling hands, calming you down, I whispered into your ear, \"It's OK, everything will be fine Emily.\" Then, I felt a cold metallic object between my fingers. What I saw next devastated me \u2013 the engagement ring Tim had bought you.\n\nI am sad to say, I was not pleased for you at that moment; jealousy stole my heart. I regret much \u2013 not attending the wedding, ignoring multiple text messages, distancing myself from you. I still would check social media, just to make sure you hadn't changed your mind. But... I doubted even continuing to try.\n\nI lost track of time. I met a new girl, Sarah. With time, I tried to forget about you. Sarah and I would attend musicals, bowl, watch movies. We had such a good time together, and eventually, I thought I had moved on. But then I found Sarah, cheating on me in my own bed. I began to resent her, and in turn, resented myself for trusting anyone but you.\n\nI needed to see you, to see your smile, to see your life. But when I checked social media, I noticed you hadn't posted in a while. I checked every form of media.",
        "She was ticked off, again. They knew it was a problem with her. She couldn't help it. She'd been raised to finish what she started. But they constantly scheduled her for just the start of these long flights. But she had an ace in the hole, this time. She'd gotten her certifications, and she was the commander on all her flights from now on.\n\nWhenever she had two more takeoffs than landings, she began to feel anxiety. The feeling that she wasn't coming back this time because she'd left something undone. Like forgetting to put up the landing gear, or raise the flaps after takeoff. Well, if she had taken off but hadn't landed the damn plane at all, she had left something undone. Naturally, that causes anxiety.\n\nBut as the commander, she could take the yoke herself, anytime she wanted. Just to be sure, she told herself, she would make a point of landing 20 of 30 more times in the next year than she took off.",
        "As usual, it had been a long, tiring day. I sank onto the sofa, tossing my bag onto the nearby table.  Slowly, I drifted off to sleep. My imagination took over, and I vividly experienced a dream inspired by an encounter earlier that day.  During lunch with a colleague, a small boy, no older than ten, stood outside the canteen cleaning the windowpanes. He was covered in grease from head to toe, his clothes filthy and his shoes torn, yet his cherry-red lips and droopy eyes held all the innocence imaginable.\n\nIt began to rain, and after a while, he shivered. He slumped against the base of the window, facing me. I was sipping my coffee.  As our gazes met, I found it difficult to swallow. The stark contrast between my warm comfort inside the cafe and the boy, now half-drenched, was a pang of guilt in my chest.  His face betrayed no resentment for his circumstances. I called him over and offered him a cup of tea, which he gratefully accepted.  \"Don't you feel cold?\" I asked.  \"No,\" he replied, \"I feel close to nature.\" I was deeply moved by his spirit, his inherent love for nature, and his appreciation for the smallest things \u2013 things I had failed to notice. He had shown me something awe-inspiring. I wished I had a magic wand to erase his poverty with a flick of the wrist and fill his childhood with all the beauty he deserved.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Price of Being Kazaam\n\nEverybody loves Kazaam now, but it wasn't always that way.\n\nWhen he first appeared on the streets, he was just Chris Smalls\u2014a young man with a less-than-stellar reputation. With the ability to teleport at will, he naturally found himself in places where he didn't belong: VIP clubs, secure facilities, and yes, even ladies' locker rooms. If there was a restricted area, Chris had likely breached it. Eventually, law enforcement caught up with him, issuing an \"arrest at all costs\" order. The newspapers mockingly declared him \"Wanted: Dead or Alive.\" Young Chris seemed destined for disaster, moving everywhere and nowhere all at once.\n\nThen came the turning point: the police offered him a deal. A hostage situation needed resolution, and they could use his unique talents. Save the innocent people, they said, and his slate would be wiped clean. Chris seized the opportunity, teleporting into the bank and rescuing the hostages. In an unexpected twist, they even captured the perpetrator\u2014a notorious serial robber with a substantial bounty on his head. Suddenly, Chris had both a clean record and a windfall of cash. That's when the realization struck: he could help people *and* make a decent living doing it.\n\nThe public's perception didn't change overnight, but gradually he became their beloved local hero. His face became a regular fixture on evening news broadcasts, and his new moniker, 'Kazaam,' frequently graced newspaper headlines\u2014this time for all the right reasons. Ironically, he now had legitimate access to all the exclusive places he'd once snuck into, welcomed with open arms. Kazaam's redemption story seemed unstoppable.\n\nSo when a disheveled, slightly intoxicated Kazaam stumbled into Hank's bar late one Wednesday night, it was quite the surprise.\n\nHe shuffled to the counter, eased onto a stool, and pressed his forehead against the cool wood. Through his mumbling, Hank caught the words \"scotch\" and \"rocks,\" and promptly served him a glass.\n\n\"On the house. You earned it, Kazaam.\"\n\nKazaam lifted his head, contemplated the glass momentarily, then drained it. After wiping his mouth with his sleeve, he buried his face in his hands.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he muttered. \"But tonight, I'm Chris. And I'm paying for that drink.\"\n\nHank shrugged and took Chris' glass. \"Sure thing, Chris. Whatever you want. Anything else? You seem... down.\"\n\nChris lowered his hands and propped his elbows on the counter, giving Hank a puzzled look. \"You mean... you actually care if I'm feeling down?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah. I may not be able to help much, but I'm a good listener. Besides, you're probably more interesting than my usual customers.\" Hank chuckled softly. \"Come on, Chris. What could possibly trouble a superhero?\"\n\nChris' expression soured at the word 'superhero.' \"I hate being a superhero,\" he whispered. \"People don't understand the cost of having a superpower\u2014what we have to sacrifice. Pour me another scotch, and I'll tell you why.\"\n\nHank served him a generous pour.",
        "The world rejoiced at their discovery. Confirmation arrived: we are not alone. But the aftermath defied all prediction. Ten weeks after extraction from a drifting Kuiper Belt asteroid, the frozen eggs hatched within a controlled lab environment.  Initially, they seemed harmless\u2014tiny, fragile beings with dull claws and strangely oval heads.  Scientists, maintaining constant surveillance, allowed them to mature in an isolated chamber.  Cameras recorded their every move, 24/7.\n\nTragedy struck three months later. The largest creature, somehow breaching the chamber wall, leaving only a gaping hole, went on a rampage. Dr. Jonas Ruthger became the first victim, impaled and torn apart by the creature's sharpened claws. He never stood a chance. The response task force, deployed for containment, discovered the creatures possessed a telekinesis-like ability to manipulate magnetic fields.  As bullets rained down, the predator conjured an invisible shield.  Two hours elapsed before its capture, subdued not by conventional weaponry, which proved useless, but by a concussive grenade.\n\nWithin a few months, they reached maturity.  The largest, dubbed \u201cApex,\u201d displayed signs of leadership and exceptional intelligence.  Aware of their observation, they systematically located and destroyed every camera within thirty minutes. Plunged into darkness, we immediately mobilized the response task force, heavily armored, but as they prepared to breach the chamber, the power grid failed, plunging the entire facility into darkness.  The echoing chamber doors opened into an eerie silence, quickly shattered by screams.  Communication ceased soon after. Following the facility\u2019s fall, we lost track of them, though the search continued relentlessly.\n\nThree years passed before their terrifying resurgence.  They returned in greater numbers, wielding amplified power.  We were driven from our planet, our home.",
        "It started as a normal day at the bank. I was depositing a check from my accounting job, standing in line behind a large man with whom I'd struck up a conversation about the wildly fluctuating weather. I'd just remarked on the crazy wind and how things had taken a turn for the worse when a pair of individuals in balaclavas and heavy winter coats walked in.  \"See, case in point,\" I'd quipped. \"In a couple of days, they'll be putting those away and wearing t-shirts again.\"\n\nIronically, those were my last words before everything went sideways.\n\nSuddenly, shiny metal glinted\u2014guns, imbued with murderous intent.  I felt instantly vulnerable and afraid.  Then, a bizarre thought crossed my mind: I probably wasn't going to make it to the library that day. Apparently, my mind handles crises in strange ways.\n\nThey overpowered the portly, elderly security guard in seconds.  I watched, frozen in shock. The guard looked well past his prime and clearly unable to offer much resistance.  That left the rest of us. The large man I'd been talking to had ducked behind a desk. The drive-through teller remained oblivious, but the other tellers had dropped below their counters, and the remaining customers were shrinking back from the sudden eruption of violence.\n\nDamn. That made me the closest person to the robbers, and likely their next target.  Fortunately, I had a trick up my sleeve, one honed since elementary school for dealing with potentially dangerous individuals. I stared up into a corner of the ceiling, focusing my attention on my nose, willing the blood vessels to dilate. I felt the pressure build, then release.\n\nI cringed, collapsing to the ground, clutching my head.  \"Damn tumor,\" I groaned, feigning pain.  \"Sorry, give me a minute,\" I mumbled, removing one hand and holding it palm up, fingers splayed, towards them. My other hand slid from the side of my head to my forehead. I feigned a spasm of pain before regaining a semblance of composure. I felt the warm stickiness of blood trickling down my lip, tasting the metallic tang. \"Right. I guess I'm\u2026\" I winced again. \"I'll talk. I don't have that much time left anyway.\"\n\nThe bank robbers\u2014because that's what my brain finally registered them as\u2014seemed to soften slightly. \"Hey, no worries, man,\" one of them said. \"We just want the money. Don't get me wrong, we'll absolutely kill anybody that tries anything, but we don't *want* to have to kill anybody.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I rasped weakly. \"Just take the money and don't shoot anybody.\" I hoped that had bought the bank manager enough time to alert the police.\n\nAfter a few minutes of the robbers shuffling things around, I saw flashing police lights approaching outside. I gestured to the others in the bank to escape. They bolted. I stayed.  Leaving wouldn't have been consistent with the character I'd created. Besides, in these situations, negotiators usually want a hostage to facilitate the robbers' demands.\n\nLeveraging my ability to bleed on cue, I attributed it to stress exacerbating my fictitious tumor.",
        "Full lips, blue eyes, black hair. His quintessential woman. He watched her from the corner of his eye, catching her glances in his direction.  She wouldn't stop looking, and a wave of awkward embarrassment washed over him. He jerked his head towards the window, cursing his own ineptitude.  \"Fuckin' *Idiot* you are, mate. Just talk to her, just give it a shot. A pretty lass like that's once in a lifetime.\"\n\nA shuffling sound broke his internal monologue.  He turned to see the woman, a voluptuous figure, settling into the seat beside him. Her beauty hit him like a ton of bricks.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Anna.\"\n\n\"Jim.\"\n\n\"So tell me, Jim. Who are you?\"\n\n\"Pretty much nobody. I'm not anyone important.\"\n\nThe bus stopped briefly, and an elderly couple boarded, taking their seats. Jim took a deep breath, the silence beginning to feel heavy.\n\n\"So this is awkward,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"No, it's not,\" Anna replied. \"Silence isn't awkward. *People* are awkward. Silence is golden, silence is bliss. Come on then, tell me more. What do you do?\"\n\nAs Jim relayed the details of his relatively mundane life, Anna found herself falling for him. His messy hair, his nonchalance, his apparent disregard for her attention\u2014it was curiously attractive.  Infatuated, his words faded into a blurry white noise as her senses were overwhelmed by the burgeoning emotion.\n\n\"....so yeah, that's how the stresses are calculated,\" Jim finished abruptly.",
        "My alarm buzzed, and I groaned, instinctively slapping for the snooze button. I missed, sending the clock clattering to the floor, where it flipped to FM radio.  Now, I had blaring Spanish music *and* no more sleep.  I wiped the sleep from my eyes and slowly opened them.\n\nThen, I saw it. A giant floating head stared down at me.  Have you ever woken up to that? No? Well, it\u2019s\u2026 unsettling.  Let\u2019s just say it startled me.\n\nThe giant head sniffed the air. \u201cOh my god, did you really just shit yourself?! AHAHA!\u201d\n\nSo, here's another question: Have you ever been mocked by a giant floating head for an accident it *caused*? I\u2019m going to assume you haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWHAAGGHFUCK,\u201d I sputtered, still trying to process the situation.\n\nThe head, if it could, would have been doubled over with laughter. \u201cOh man, this is great.\u201d\n\nMortified, I scrambled to the bathroom, clutching my backside as the head roared with laughter.  I cleaned up as best I could and wrapped a towel around myself. The head, meanwhile, had drifted over to my TV, poking around with what I can only describe as ethereal curiosity. It turned its attention back to me.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize the human race was so inferior that they actually based their lives around technology! I mean look at this thing. What are you supposed to do with this? Stare at it?\u201d  It floated over to my still-blaring alarm clock. \u201cAnd this thing is very loud and annoying.\u201d  Lasers shot from its eyes, leaving a scorched mark on the floor.\n\n\u201cLook, mister\u2026 uhm\u2026 Head. I\u2019m not sure what you are or what you\u2019re doing here\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is *Captain* Head to you. I am on an important mission to determine the human race\u2019s progress and see if they are ready to join the galactic unity.\u201d  He drifted uncomfortably close. \u201cSo far I am less than impressed.\u201d\n\nOkay.  An alien was in my room, and the fate of humanity rested on my shoulders.  Mom always said I\u2019d screw up big one day. Captain Head lifted my phone with some sort of telekinesis and began scrolling through it\u2026 without thumbs.\n\n\u201cThis is an interesting device though. Apps, huh? Reddit, Grindr\u2026 OH! Now *this* is an impressive app. Facebook! That sounds right up my alley.\u201d\n\nThe giant head spent the next few hours laughing and posting on my Facebook profile.\n\n\u201cLook, Captain Head. Didn\u2019t you have an important mission?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now! Someone is wrong on the internet! I must inform them of this!\u201d\n\nI sighed. At this rate, he\u2019d stumble onto the darker corners of the internet.",

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Last Promise\n\nWe huddled beneath the staircase, as the wind howled around our ancient wooden house. The loose wall panels rattled ominously, and I shuddered as another gust tore through countless gaps in the deteriorating structure.\n\nEven above the wind's fury, we heard the gunshots. A harvesting gang had been spotted prowling nearby, and now they'd found us. These ruthless bands captured people to sell as \"easy kills\" to the highest bidder, usually accepting food\u2014the wasteland's most precious currency\u2014as payment. While they needed weapons and ammunition too, they only killed their victims directly when they proved too strong or difficult to transport. Since townships willing to purchase wasteland captives were scarce, the gangs typically executed adults on sight, reserving capture for children.\n\nOne might wonder: why would anyone pay to kill another? The answer lay in our world's cruel reality\u2014from birth, each person was granted exactly thirty years of life. For many, especially those surviving in the wasteland, this was sufficient. But the powerful\u2014the men and women who controlled the farms\u2014craved more. They purchased their path to immortality through others' deaths.\n\nAnother gunshot cracked through the night, closer now. A scream pierced the darkness\u2014I couldn't identify whose voice it was, but I knew it belonged to one of our neighbors, our friends, our kin.\n\nMy brother sat before me, eyes clenched shut, fingers tangled in his matted black hair. Earlier that day had been beautiful; we'd lounged in the sunshine, cooling our feet in the river's flow. Despite its misleading name, the \"wasteland\" held its own beauty. Now that serenity felt like a distant dream as we cowered in our darkened house. I reached forward and clasped his hand. His eyes opened, focusing on me as clarity seemed to replace his panic.\n\n\"Not quite how we expected to spend our last evening, eh sis?\" he whispered, his dark humor ever-present.\n\n\"No, not exactly,\" I managed a weak smile.\n\n\"Although at least we're together,\" he squeezed my hand reassuringly.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you I'd never leave you?\" I returned the gesture.\n\n\"You know you might not be able to keep that promise for much longer.\" He looked down, avoiding my gaze. \"Mum would never say which of us was born first. Only that it was 8 hours apart.\"\n\nSilence fell between us for a long moment. We both knew those 8 hours would be unbearable. The roar of an engine starting cut through the storm, interrupting our thoughts. The harvesters were departing. We listened intently as the vehicle's rumble faded into the distance.\n\nThim smiled. \"Well sis, at least we can stretch our legs for ten minutes now. It's almost midnight.\" His face fell slightly at mentioning the time of one of our births, but he quickly composed himself for my sake. \"It's almost midnight, so the stars will be out.\"\n\nHe scrambled from our makeshift shelter and approached the window. I followed, standing behind him as we gazed at the stars\u2014a familiar comfort. I stood there with him for what felt like eternity, knowing the moment approached.\n\nA tear traced silently down my cheek as I reached into my shawl's pocket. The cold metal pressed against my palm as I took a step back from my brother, who remained transfixed by the celestial display above.",
        "\"Dad, you're on TV again!\" Eric's voice drifted from the living room. I generally avoided the television; watching it always instilled a vague unease.  And I\u2019d certainly never seen *myself* on it. Had I?\n\nMy memory wasn't what it used to be before the Great War. My doctor attributed this to lingering toxins, remnants of the bombings, still present in the air.  Come to think of it, I hadn't actually served on the front lines. I had hazy recollections of six years spent at a base, training soldiers and enduring long hours on guard duty.\n\nAn itch started in my left leg. It always ached whenever my thoughts drifted towards the Great War \u2013 one of the many reasons I suppressed them.  As always, the itching brought a strange sensation, a feeling that the leg wasn't quite mine, that it didn't belong. I'd mentioned this to my doctor during one of our bi-monthly appointments, and he'd assured me it was nothing to worry about.\n\nSo I didn't. I stopped scratching and quelled the near-overpowering urge to *STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR*.\n\n\"Dad, you never told me you won a medal!\" Eric called again. A faint smile touched my lips. Whatever he was watching must have been a fabricated documentary. I'd certainly never won any medals\u2026 had I?\n\n*STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR.*",
        "The planet practically reverberated with the announcement, broadcast simultaneously from every speaker on Earth. Scientists later confirmed the absolute simultaneity, detecting no light-speed delays.  Even unplugged speakers inexplicably emitted the proclamation.\n\nThe first question on everyone's mind: \"Who sent the message?\" The second: \"What's Galactic Deathball?\"\n\nOver the next few months, wars ceased, long-standing conflicts resolved, and even the most isolationist governments engaged in global diplomacy. The overarching question became: How do we prepare for the unknown\u2014an event of unpredictable nature and arrival?\n\nWhile the public remained unaware of the closed-door discussions, the abrupt shift in the Olympic Games hinted at the underlying changes. Events took on a distinctly martial focus. Governments sponsored training facilities emphasizing multi-disciplinary competitions like triathlons, biathlons, and even newly invented hybrids like the MMArathon. It became clear that the world was cultivating peak-human athletes, handsomely rewarded, to compete in Galactic Deathball.\n\nYears passed uneventfully. The initial global unity eroded with time, and the fervor for the new sports waned, losing sponsorship in many countries.  However, dedicated communities of practitioners kept them alive.\n\nThen came the second message. A copy of \u201cThe Rulebook\u201d materialized beside every sleeping person, staggered in delivery.  Written in two languages\u2014one unsettlingly alien, the other the recipient's native tongue\u2014it provided the ultimate Rosetta Stone.  The alien language was deciphered almost as quickly as it was uploaded online.\n\n\u201cThe Rulebook\u201d proved a partial misnomer.  Much of the text detailed the game's history, past events, and background information\u2014more scholarly treatise than technical manual.  Perhaps this was because the game itself was deceptively simple.\n\nThe playing field: an equilateral polygon, minimum four sides, ranging from a quarter-mile to just under a half-mile across.  The number of sides equaled twice the number of competing teams.\n\nTeams were assigned starting positions along the polygon's faces, the order determined by a draw. The Deathball\u2014a one-quarter kilogram iron sphere with universally graspable handholds\u2014was placed at the field's center.\n\nUpon the starting signal, players had five seconds to enter the field. Leaving without the Deathball meant death. Leaving with it granted the power to choose who died, followed by a field reset. The game ended when only one team remained.\n\nThe only restrictions: players had to be unmodified members of their species, and equipment was limited to worn items extending no more than four millimeters from the skin in any given pose.\n\nThe game clearly prioritized strength, speed, and above all, endurance. MMArathon\u2019s popularity surged.\n\nTwo more years passed before The Ship arrived. Earth was ready. Strategies were honed, a non-lethal version of Deathball had spawned eight world championships, and the team\u2014the Heroes of Earth\u2014boarded the ship amidst a roar of global support.\n\nThe team comprised the planet's finest physical specimens: long-distance sprinters built for speed, brutal martial artists, all possessing the endurance to run marathons and fight multiple consecutive matches.\n\nAs the match began, every screen on Earth switched on, broadcasting the event.  The planet watched, waited, and worried.\n\nWorry proved unnecessary.",

Our reputation as the drunken, inbred neighbors of the galaxy was already firmly established.\n\n\u201cThat has to be a record!

        "A girl with long honey blonde hair knocked lightly on the door of the bright Victorian style house. Her legs shifting back and forth in a bowlegged pattern. She looked up at the expanse of the house. The door opened a crack. \n\n\"Business or pleasure?\" Whispered a soft sultry voice on the other side of the door. A flash of raven confirmed it was her. \n\n\"B-Business.\" She cast her eyes down to the floor and fidgeted. The voice gave a derisive snort. \n\n\"Very well...\" The door opened a smidge more and she was quickly pulled inside. \"Well dear sister.... What brings you here? Something the matter? You never have asked for me to use any of my powers.\" The girl looked at the long black haired woman that supposedly was her sister. \n\n\"W-Well..\" The woman ushered her to sit down. \n\n\"Come dear Camille. There's no need to be shy.\" The woman cast a quick glance on Camille's odd limping gait and hide a crooked smile behind her lace fan. \"Now what is the matter dear?\" Camille took a deep breath. \n\n\"It's Wallace...\" She paused. \"You know? The man that I've been seeing lately.\" \n\nThe woman gave a twitch of a grin. \"Oh yes I seem to remember him...\" She fanned herself profusely. \"What's the matter with Wallace?\" \n\nCamille flushed red. \"It's rather embarrassing but I didn't know who else to turn to dear sister.\" She took a deep breath and whispered. \"Wh-When we make love, h-his manhood seems to triple in size. Making it hurt and n-near impossible. And whenever I ask him about it he avoids the question and refuses to get help.\" \n\n\"Well I can't help him if he doesn't want help darling.\" \n\nCamille nodded. \"I know. So I want you to change *me*\" \n\nThe woman's eyes widened in shock. \"Change *you*?\" \n\n\"Well yes. I-If his m-m-manhood grows than I want m-my womanhood to grow as well.

The trees swayed in an uncontrollable tremollo of wind, as if they wanted to escape the roots that have kept them alive for so long.\n\n\"I haven't been completely honest with you,\" he said.\n\nArms wrapped around herself, she braced against the weather, all the while listening to his voice. She had never heard him this way before. He had always been loud. Confident. Not the quiet and solemn type she currently beheld.\n\n\"The last few months have been great,\" he continued without waiting for any cue or even an assurance that she had heard him. \"But, I need to tell you. I just broke up with Zoe. For good.\"\n\nDean fidgeted in his seat then, painfully aware of the underwear bunching up in his asshole. He was afraid of what he needed to say next. Being alone with her now though, he knew that he needed to say it.\n\n\"I'm so sorry V. I didn't lie about before though. We did break up last November. Some months after that, we decided to try again. And we've been together ever since. Until last week,\" Dean said. \"When we got back from the beach, I had to end it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" V asked, her shaky voice betraying her calm stature.\n\nDean considered the question, struggling to find the right words. \"I found my happiness somewhere else.\"\n\nV followed the lightning streaking across the sky. She closed her eyes then and counted inward, *1... 2... 3..* Thunder roared. *We are right under the storm,* she thought. She began focusing on her breathing while Dean continued.\n\nAfter a moment of shared silence, Dean turned away and walked to the window. Sighing, he continued, \"I didn't tell you this to force you into action. I'm not trying to make you like me. You may not even like me. You're just too nice sometimes.\"\n\nHis chuckle quickly evaporated in the solemnity of the moment.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I know you could hate me for what I did. And maybe you should. But.... I just couldn't take all the lies anymore. I'm the last person to speak about truths, but the only thing I truly know is that whatever we are, I just want to share the truth with you. Even if we continue as friends, become something more - fingers crossed haha -, or even nothing at all. I just..... wanted you to know. The truth.\"\n\nThe words pierced her, unleashing a heavy chest characterized with *that* feeling. She had been hurt, but in her 27 years, she knew that it is only the ones that were able to get close that are able to hurt us so.\n\nV opened her eyes then, finding Dean's outline looking out the window. She was thankful that he was looking away from her. For a while, she was content to look at him.\n\nAnd against her conscience, against the heavy pain in her heart, and against all thoughts of reason she said, \"Hey.\"",
        "The nurse came into my room with a smile. \"We have a surprise for you, Edgar.\" I fucking hate surprises, but I couldn't tell her that. She had been my nurse for several months now, and she was a pleasant older woman. She cared a lot for her charges. At least, she seemed to. \n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, feigning interest. Her grin expanded from a subtle smile to a face-splitting gash. She was very excited. That meant I was better, but no, the doctor would be the one to tell me that. That leaves a person. \n\n\"You have a visitor! I'll bring him in right away.\" She walked out of the room with a joyful gait, leaving me unmoved. I hurt today, and I really don't want a visitor unless it's family. But no one really cares when they are doing their philanthropic part.",
        "Here's a restructured version of your story, enhancing its flow while maintaining its creative essence:\n\n# The Leaf's Journey\n\nThe fall leaves rustled in the wind through the crowd of children. One stray leaf found itself separated from the rest as it rose into the sky, only to land on the top of a monkey bar. A child's hand came swooping from below, forcing the lone leaf to curl around the bar. As the child let go of the other monkey bar, he fell flat to his bum\u2014the leaf proving too slippery a surface to continue his trek across the bars.\n\nThe child began to cry, and the lone leaf could not help but feel responsible. Of course, it wasn't the leaf's fault; it couldn't control the whims of the wind. Through the child's tight grip, the leaf could feel his pain. Angry, the child threw the leaf to the ground and continued his plea for help. A teacher rushed over, stomping on the leaf in her wake, and carried the boy to the nurse, leaving the leaf alone on the playground.\n\nThe wind swept the leaf up again, circling the playground with mysterious purpose. Soon enough, the leaf found itself rushed to the ground just in front of a small girl. She ran right at the leaf, suddenly falling\u2014once again, the leaf proved to be a slippery surface, this time for a shoe rather than a hand. The girl, much like the boy, began to cry, though she paid less attention to the leaf, focusing solely on her pain. Teachers, seemingly more attentive to a young girl's cries, arrived within seconds. An older lady carried her to the nurse's office, following the same route as before.\n\nThe wind, apparently bored with the playground, shifted its focal point east into the forest. The speed picked up ominously. As the leaf circled a tree with increasing velocity, it managed to cut a small twig loose. More debris joined the aerial dance\u2014branches, rocks, and assorted foliage flailing about in the strengthening gusts.\n\nA newspaper caught in the wind revealed the date: October 29th, 1940, with the headline \"Massive Spike in Tornado Activity.\" The leaf finally understood what was happening. The wind's focal point returned to the playground, howling across the monkey bars. Children tried to run inside but couldn't escape the barrage of sticks and stones.\n\nWhen the wind's tantrum finally subsided, it disappeared in an instant. The leaf settled to the ground just as a door flew open, revealing the teacher, woman, and the two injured children. They stood stunned at the playground's transformation. But the leaf no longer felt guilt\u2014instead, a sense of pride washed over it. For in that moment, the boy's bruised bottom and the girl's twisted ankle seemed insignificant compared to what they had all just witnessed.",
        "Harry stepped outside with his pint and breathed deep the crisp autumn Oxfordian air. *A beautiful night*, he thought, as he stared up into the deep expanse above, twinkling with stars.\n\n\"Do - do you want to learn about astronomy, farmer?\" A voice and a chuckle came from one of the tables laid on the street. Harry turned politely to face his addresser. Sat at the table, cloaked in black, were two young men, chuckling to one another and passing cheap wine between them. A flash of irritation hit him as he realized who addressed him; that most obnoxious of sub-species, *students*.\n\n\"*I said*... would you like to learn about astronomy, farmer? After all, you *are* ignorant of the majesty of the heavens.\" A blank look, which swapped to an obsequious smile, appeared on Harry's face as he worked out his response.\n\n\"Oh yes, zur,\" he started, his accent slipping to a mimicry of his father's. \"Oh yes, I would loike to learn about the ztars. Oi've alwayz wondered about them, but never got no learning. No zur.\" The students grinned, and one took a breath to begin his patronizing lecture. \"Well, you see...\"\n\n\"After all, zur,\" Harry interrupted, \"it's not loike, as a farmer, Oi learnt to read the skoi to know the zeasons, or the weather. Now, moi brother, *he* knowz the skoi. A sailor, see?\" The two lads looked nonplussed.",
        "The ever-dutiful machines whirred and hummed around me as I climbed out of the Assisted Hibernation suit. Every bone and muscle screamed with the familiar ache. \"This is my last contract,\" I muttered, the same lie I told myself after every mission.  I choked down the usual cocktail of electrolyte, protein, and carbohydrate supplements, each one more foul than the last, and washed the gritty residue away with water before pulling on my uniform.\n\nThe locker room was empty, suggesting I was the first awake.  The computer chimed, informing me we were home. Anticipating the crew's awakening, I dusted off the celebratory Champagne and put it on ice. I sat down at the communications terminal. \"This is Exploratory Probe Six-Eight-Twelve, do you read me?\"\n\nOnly static answered.  Micrometeorites, I figured, must have damaged the communications array. I\u2019d try again when we entered visual range.  Still, it was odd that no one else was awake.  I climbed back up to the weightless center of the ship where the hibernation pods were located.  The crew wasn't dead, but their pods all flashed Status Critical: Oversleep; Cannot Waken.  At least we\u2019d be in orbit within the hour, where I could hand this problem off to someone more qualified.\n\nI returned to the communications array, where the Champagne sat chilling.  A shimmering blue star shone ahead \u2013 Earth! I uncorked the bottle, surprised at the force required to pull the cork free.  The Champagne poured flat.  \u201cTypical corporate cost-cutting,\u201d I grumbled, pouring myself a glass and toasting my terminal before taking a sip.\n\nThe taste shocked me.  It wasn\u2019t the lack of bubbles, but a sharp, woody taste, like licking a tree or an old book.  A warning flashed on the terminal: \u201cHyperdrive Failure.\u201d Not my department.\n\nThe blue dot of Earth was now the size of my pinky nail.  Even with a damaged communications array, we had to be in range.  I tried hailing again. A few beeps, then static. On the last mission, autopilot would have taken over by now, correcting our orbit and prepping for unload.\n\nHours bled into one another as I ran diagnostics on the communications system and checked internal fuses.  Everything appeared in perfect order.  Continents and swirling clouds now resolved themselves on the blue-green marble of Earth.  I snapped a few pictures for my family back home.  Only automated satellites responded to my hails, and even their replies were fragmented.  Finally, we entered orbit, the dark side of Earth rotating into view. I manually corrected our trajectory, a process that took over an hour.  Through the viewport, the crescent Earth, mostly shrouded in night, reflected no light.  Like a new moon, the night side was completely black.  We were over an ocean. I took more pictures for my family and tried the comms again. More static.\n\nWith a damaged array, I was helpless. I wasn\u2019t certified for external repairs. All I could do was wait.",
        "Edgar\u2019s Story: A Revised Narrative\n\nMy name is Edgar. I was a person once.\n\nI remember the chilling metallic touch of the cage bars against my trembling body. The dripping sink down the hall, a metronome marking the time until they came for me. The sound echoed in the stark silence, broken only by the frantic thump of my own heart.  I\u2019d known this day was coming, always known, yet nothing could have truly prepared me.  A naive part of me had clung to the hope of being overlooked, spared.\n\nGrowing up, they fed us stories: work hard, prove your worth, and earn Pilgrim status, a valued member of society.  I wish they\u2019d just told me it was bullshit.  All that work, all that striving, for nothing.  My father was a Breeder, a Pilgrim granted the privilege of creating new Shells.  Perhaps foolishly, I thought his position might offer me some protection, some connection.  But he was already gone, moved on before I even had a chance to know him.  I hadn't seen him since I was a child. Lying in bed at night, I used to wonder what it felt like to burn through bodies the way he did.\n\nFootsteps in the hall. The dripping stopped. This was it.  A bone-deep dread seized me, my teeth chattering against the rising tide of fear.  The guards arrived, restrained me.  Resistance was futile; I\u2019d always been weak, and now, a weary acceptance had settled in.\n\nThe walk seemed endless, a procession past the cells of others awaiting the same fate \u2013 their bodies repurposed.  Some wept, some raged; I pitied them. Not all could face the inevitable with the same grim resignation I had somehow mustered.\n\nWe passed through a gate, the guards nodding to a man holding a key before a large laboratory door. Its pristine white finish clashed violently with the rusted metal and crumbling concrete of the surrounding area.  Inside, all eyes turned to me.  My 25th birthday party, a macabre celebration I never wanted.  They strapped me to a chair, drew blood, confirmed I wasn't brain-dead.  The silence was the most terrifying part.",
        "Approaching the final landing sequence, the vector correction thrusters came online. \"Steady her out, Lieutenant,\" the Captain commanded.\n\n\"Roger that, Captain. Thrusters steadying. Applying left rudder, six degrees. Quartermaster, can you see anything yet?\"\n\nThe Quartermaster didn't respond. His mouth hung agape as they dipped below the clouds, the surface of the breathtaking planet coming into view for the first time in human history. Dense jungles bordered coastlines lapped by crystalline waters. Out the port-side windows, flowing sand dunes were dotted by enormous\u2026 wait, what?\n\n\"Are\u2026 are those pyramids? Captain, can you confirm visual?\"\n\nStunned silence filled the craft. The landing suffered from the sudden loss of attention to the controls. A massive shudder gave way to a bumpy touchdown, jostling the crew and equipment.  This, however, barely registered.  They all but burst from their seats and into the desert expanse.  Exchanging awestruck glances, the crew scrambled up the nearest dune and stared silently at the sight before them.\n\n\"Lieutenant, tell me you see this. Those\u2026 those are Egyptian pyramids. The people down there, are they\u2026?\"\n\nThe Captain trailed off, but the Lieutenant knew what he was asking. Yes, those were Egyptian-style pyramids. And yes, those appeared to be human beings gathered in the city below. A small group was heading their way, their figures shimmering in the heat radiating off the sand. This was incredible. The Captain contacted ground crew back on Earth. The conversation was short and to the point.\n\n\"Captain, this is critical. Take pictures and document everything. Do not call again unless it's an emergency; the communication is interfering with your body camera equipment.\"  Click.\n\nThe crew set out to meet their welcoming party. The Egyptians had advanced significantly since leaving Earth.",
        "Five hours ago, the terrorist cell Dragon's Bane attempted a devastating attack on Diamond City.  Dr. Probability, renowned for his predictive abilities, alerted authorities and pinpointed the probable locations the terrorists would target.  His intel proved accurate, though some terrorists deviated from their plans, resulting in 47 injuries and one fatality. While the city mourned the loss and supported the grieving families, many expressed gratitude that a larger catastrophe was averted in the city of nearly half a million.\n\nDespite his role in minimizing the devastation, Dr. Probability found himself handcuffed in a holding cell at Diamond City's central police station. Instead of the expected mayoral handshake at city hall, he was arrested under suspicion of orchestrating the attack.  Detective Reeves, his interrogator, was convinced of Dr. Probability's guilt.  \u201cHow did you know there was going to be an attack?!\u201d Reeves yelled, slamming his fists on the table. \u201cTell me now!\u201d\n\nCalmly, Dr. Probability explained his reasoning. \"Last week, Dragon's Bane threatened our nation. Given the mayor's recent condemnation of them, there was a 33 in 40 probability we'd be targeted. I went to Herbert Park, our largest public space, and observed a van unloading explosives.  I immediately contacted the authorities and advised them of other probable locations.\"\n\nReeves scoffed. \u201cBullshit! After every catastrophic event, you're always at the center.  The city thinks you\u2019re a hero, but I don\u2019t buy it!  You and your probabilities! There\u2019s a 1 in 3 chance this bank will be robbed at noon, a 4 in 9 chance the chief\u2019s having an affair, and an 87 in 88 chance I\u2019ve been bullshitting you all!\u201d\n\nUnfazed by Reeves\u2019 outburst, Dr. Probability responded, \u201cWhat would I have to gain? I\u2019m a statistician, not some power-hungry mastermind. I have neither the wealth, the influence, nor the desire for the things you suggest.\u201d He gestured to his handcuffs. \u201cThis hardly looks like the life of someone orchestrating terrorist attacks.\u201d\n\nReeves, momentarily silenced, sat down heavily.  His carefully rehearsed accusations faltered in the face of Dr. Probability\u2019s simple logic. \u201cHow did you know the *locations*?\u201d he asked, defeated.\n\n\u201cSimple statistics,\u201d Dr. Probability replied.  \"Herbert Park was the most probable primary target.",

        "A painter's work is never complete. Even as I add the last touches to the canvas now smeared with thick streaks representing the water lilies before me, I know this to be true. The lead paints make my head flutter for a moment. I take a sip of gin, peering into the water as the sun paints its own majesty with golden rays across the pond.  I realized long ago I could never reach the ideals of the old Renaissance painters who tried to compare their works to the masterpieces of Heaven. Impressionism never tried to reach for such foolish heights. Instead, the canvas allows us to express our innermost thoughts with the brush. If my work only spoke about the sorrow I've experienced, the joy I've found, and the regret I've known in life, expressed in imperfect strokes, I consider my work far more valuable than the stark reality Da Vinci has crafted.\n\nAs I packed my materials, a flash of light illuminated from the corner of my eye. Yet another person clad in strange clothes ran towards me, begging for an audience.  \u201cMr. van Gogh, please,\u201d she pleaded, much like the rest. \u201cYou need to listen to me.\u201d\n\nI simply waved her away and continued, supplies in hand, to the street, knowing most of these people don't dare to confront me in public. They all know my name and hurl themselves at me in private, but the moment I walk anywhere with other people, they recede, only to reinvade my personal time as I try to paint. At first, I figured they were a prank meant to detract from my art by mocking my failures with false promises of fame, as if anyone would dare cast their gaze upon my paintings and see anything beyond the surface. But their sheer number and insistence has convinced me otherwise.\n\nPerhaps the alcohol has finally invaded my spirit, and these men and women are nothing but delusions meant to torment me. Perchance I've simply gone mad; after all, they refuse to appear in public, leaving me the fool to insist on their existence. If the former, I can still paint in peace, letting the delusions shape and form art. If the latter, I know I can still paint a sky flooded with stars behind the bars of an asylum.",

        "I'll help restructure this story to improve its flow and coherence. Here's a revised version with better organization and narrative structure:\n\n# The President's Game\n\n## Part 1: The Discovery\nIn January 2011, fifteen-year-old Michael Brown makes an unexpected discovery while playing Call of Duty from his Missouri home - he recognizes President Obama's distinctive voice over the game chat. Despite Obama's initial denials, Michael catches him in several contradictions and forces him to admit his identity. Using this knowledge, Michael blackmails the President into becoming his regular gaming partner, threatening to expose Obama's secret addiction to Call of Duty and the hundreds of hours he's logged during his presidency.\n\n## Part 2: Obama's Revenge Begins\nAfter enduring a grueling seven-hour CoD marathon for Michael's birthday in May 2011, Obama quietly begins plotting his revenge. Over several months, he deliberately deteriorates his gaming performance. By February 2012, when Michael notices the decline, Obama implements the next phase of his plan. He fabricates a story about Middle East conflicts affecting his gameplay, setting the stage for an elaborate deception.\n\n## Part 3: The Deception\nA month later, Obama presents Michael with a fabricated crisis involving Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the Islamic State of Iraq. He spins an intricate tale about secret drone technology - miniature armed robots that can be controlled through Call of Duty's interface. Obama claims he's being forced by shadowy corporations and banks to use unwitting gamers as drone pilots, threatening him with \"another JFK-style assassination\" if he refuses to comply.\n\n## Part 4: The Psychological Toll\nMichael, believing he's piloting real combat drones, takes on several \"missions\" - actually regular CoD games. The psychological impact is severe: he develops PTSD, insomnia, and a heavy cigarillo addiction. When Michael tries to find ways to avoid the missions, Obama creates additional lies about the system's functionality, forcing Michael to continue his \"service.\"\n\n## Part 5: The Final Solution\nBy 2014, ISIS has become a legitimate threat, making Obama's deception increasingly risky. Viewing Michael as a liability, Obama orchestrates an elaborate plan involving local law enforcement and Michael's friend, Dorian Johnson. Knowing Michael's addiction to cigarillos, Obama manipulates events through his CIA contacts, leading to a confrontation between Michael and Officer Darren Wilson.\n\n## Epilogue\nThe story concludes with a dark twist: Obama's scheme succeeds, with Michael's death becoming obscured by the resulting media circus and racial controversy. The final paragraph takes a satirical turn, suggesting Obama continues his drone campaigns with Putin while spreading \"Obamacare and communism.\"",

For so long, he had ruled as the king of an ever-diminishing kingdom, now reduced to a barren, lifeless rock. He turned to his queen, and he knew\u2014she felt it, too. \n\nThe sun burned hot and red, sinking low on the horizon, casting its grim light over charred mountains and empty, desolate oceans. Each day, it grew larger, inching closer, preparing to devour their world. Soon, it would swallow their home. What came after, neither of them knew.

I drummed my fingers on the worn wooden surface of the bar, my legs aching from hours of standing.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out, instinctively checking the time again.  Had only two minutes really passed since the last time I looked? I glanced at the clock on the wall, then back at my phone and sighed.  Seeing who the text was from, I smiled. Even a simple \"How's work?\" conveyed her care.\n\nI sent a quick reply, the thought of her a comforting presence as I tucked my phone away, straightened my back, and stretched.

It was throwing me. \"I'm in...\" She broke off with another laugh. \"The outer stratosphere.\"\n\nI hesitated. \"You... what?\"\n\n\"I'm almost up in space,\" she said. A breeze rushed by, causing a ripple of static. \"Oh man, I think I'm going to try for the moon.\"\n\nI froze. \"The moon?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that be *crazy?*\"\n\n\"Don't do it!\" I blurted out. \n\nMo paused. \"What?\"\n\n\"Um...\" Inspiration struck. \"I mean, don't do it *yet. * Could you, uh, FaceTime me?

        "Here's my polished version of your story, maintaining its emotional core while enhancing its flow and clarity:\n\n---\n\nI was adjusting my battered camera, trying to focus on a remarkably peculiar elderly couple at the foot of Huayna Picchu, when I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder. It was Oscar, the stocky local guide who had been tasked with shepherding our pale, unprepared bodies across 26 miles of Incan heritage\u2014reluctantly, no doubt.\n\nOscar never looked happy\u2014not just in this moment, but ever. Without a word, he led me to a nearby rock and gestured insistently for me to sit.\n\n\"I receive text from hostel,\" Oscar's English wasn't perfect, but his meaning was always clear. \"Your mother was in touch. She wants you to know that Billy has dead.\"\n\nThat moment\u2014when those last three words, just four measly syllables, a calamity of twelve damned letters\u2014reached my ears and triggered the neural pathways of comprehension. In that instant, I felt the ground shift beneath me, knowing I was the only one who sensed it.\n\nThe rock beneath me seemed to sink lower than my heart as I looked up at Oscar through tear-filled eyes. His head remained bowed as he asked who Billy was to me. Moments later, his sturdy arms were wrapped around my head, and he too was crying. \"I also lost a brother,\" he sobbed in my ear. \"Lo siento mucho.\"\n\nOscar pulled some strings with another tour guide and secured me a seat on a bus heading back to Cusco. I found myself sitting behind that same peculiar elderly couple, their Southern American accents now distinctly apparent. The journey back was excruciating, but it gave me time to reflect on the life I'd shared with my little brother.\n\nHe was a pain in the ass, but such a good kid. We were inseparable at home. Despite our six-year age gap, which limited our time together outside, we had our evening football games. I'd make him play goalkeeper while I practiced penalties, always insisting on using the goal without a net. It was my lucky goal, and he was a champion at retrieving the ball. Billy didn't have many other friends; he was always home, pestering me to play games or make food when I returned. Too young to cook, he'd salivate at the mere mention of my special nacho recipe.",

His head felt like someone had pierced it with their pitchfork and there was a crust of something gold and sticky smeared across his left hindquarter. It hadn't been a good night.\n\nHe gazed blearily around him. His legs were stretched out over the tattered remains of what had once been a very nice couch (maybe one of the ones that had come down with Ghengis Khan?) which had since fallen heavily from grace and now resided in a dingy apartment in southwest third circle, Hell. Through the window he could make out the harsh neon light of the sign from the brothel next door, Kingdom Cum.\n\nHe stood up and winced as his torn-up hooves met the flaming floor.\n\n\"Yo Beez, you up?\"\n\nIt was his sometimes-girlfriend, Lucy Furr. Lucy was a part-time dancer at the KC next door, and she definitely looked the part -- smooth humanoid curves and long muscular legs all covered in a fine layer of black peach fuzz. Ravishing. Today, she had big lumps of black sheep wool wrapped around each of her four calves.\n\n\"What the heaven is that?\" Beezlebub scoffed, gesturing at her footwear. \"You look like a cancerous donkey.\"\n\nShe walked in and threw a balled-up hamburger wrapper at him.\n\n\"They're called leg-warmers, dipshit.\"\n\nShe paused and studied his face intently.\n\n\"It's a human thing,\" she said softly.\n\nHe froze. \"You went up? How? When? Where?\"\n\nNo demon had gained access to the human world since years earlier when a few had climbed through the hole left after Hiroshima.\n\nLucy nodded. \"There's a small cavern we found in a place called San Francisco. Apparently there's a lot of gay people there so some Christians have been building a little passageway down here to try to get rid of them.\"\n\nBeezlebub blinked. \"But why the fuck would we care...\"\n\nLucy shrugged impatiently. \"Who knows? Point is we can get back up, and there's been a lot going on up there since the thirties. There are some pretty interesting new inventions floating around in 1989.\"",
        "*The Year: 2116*\n\n*The Place: Washington, D.C.*\n\n*News Reporter:* This week marks the 100th anniversary of Congress's historic 2016 Prohibition Act criminalizing crack caffeine, often known to users as \"coffee\".\n\nCrack caffeine was originally banned because of its contributing role in a variety of social ills, including but not limited to heart disease, type A personalities, overwork, and poor dental health. While crack caffeine is a stimulant, historians have cited its history as an opiate of the masses, making them believe that the oppression of the 9 to 5 workday and the 40-hour workweek was bearable.\n\nIn recent years, however, scientists have begun experimenting with the drug. While these experiments have mainly been limited to non-human subjects, a few prominent companies are poised to start trials administering small drips to humans. It is postulated that crack caffeine's effect on depressed subjects may give it some medicinal merit.\n\nOregon and Washington state, historic crack caffeine hubs, and Washington, D.C., a city where many prominent citizens, including Congresspeople, have been accused of being coffeeheads, are considering legislation to decriminalize crack caffeine, and have already instituted policies allowing for the medical use of condensed crack caffeine, known to users as \"chocolate.\"\n\nThere is no word yet on whether the federal government will continue to enforce crack caffeine prohibitions in states in which it is decriminalized, as the federal government is waiting to see if this legislation becomes law.",
        "\"Listen, Mr. Fluffles, there's a reason we're called 'man's best friend'. That title didn't come cheap,\" Toby exclaimed, growing agitated as the Feline Federation made preposterous demands. \"Dogs have been hunting with humans for thousands of years, providing food and companionship. It's only fair that, as humans' chosen best friend, dogs should inherit the Earth. It just makes sense,\" the grumpy Basset Hound continued.\n\n\"And what makes you think you have the ability to handle it?\" purred Mr. Fluffles, the president of the Feline Federation, a sinister-looking Siamese, holding court from his Executive Play Tower. Cardboard boxes were piled around him, housing the supreme Feline council, their smugness emanating from their finely cleaned fur like a gas leak.\n\nThe dogs howled in anger. \"Just look at us, noble creatures with brains considerably bigger than your largest, diabetic mouser,\" Toby retorted, snorting with derision. \"The idea that you could do anything better than us is simply ridiculous. You have one day to leave the court before our Mastiffs will be forced to evict you.\"\n\nFluffles rose to his full height, a full two feet above the carpeted platform, forepaws hanging in front of him, as he cleared his throat. \"My dear, Toby, you're right. Dogs have hunted with humans, protected their children, and defended their homes, noble creatures, indeed.",

Jim pinched his nose and itched at his ragged beard. Mike stared.\n\n\"Look, just\u2026 let's see the money,\" Mike demanded.\n\n\"I want to see the product first,\" Jim replied, eyes still closed.  He flicked at his nose, mimicking the coke heads he\u2019d seen across dusty tables back at the station. They did that all the time, right?

You're acting strange,\" Mike accused. \"This is how it works, these drug deals. You pay for the product first.\"\n\nBoth men shifted nervously. Unbeknownst to each other, a collective thought struck them at the exact same moment: *Fuck it, there's no recording of this deal. I'm going to arrest his ass and find the goods.*\n\nThey both smirked and reached for their pockets.\n\n\"What the fuck! Don't move!\" Mike snarled.\n\n\"You don't move first,\" Jim countered.\n\n\"Okay, *I* won't move first, then *you* won't move.\u201d\n\n\"So I get the first move?\" Jim asked, a smirk playing on his lips.\n\n\"Shit, I guess so,\" Mike conceded.\n\nIn a swift motion, Jim whipped out his .38 Special and slammed the butt into Mike's temple with a dull thud. Mike cried out, reaching for his pocket, but Jim's knee landed heavily on his wrist, snapping it.  He lay defeated as Jim expertly zip-tied his wrists.\n\n\"You're under arrest, dick bag,\" Jim declared.\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" Mike muttered through gritted teeth.\n\n\"Yeah, you're fucked.\"\n\n\"The war on fucking drugs, my ass,\" Mike spat. \"Our bosses don't know a hole from their ass in the ground.\"",

        "Here's the polished version:\n\n\"How does it feel?\" I breathed.\n\nThree men draped in dark cloaks towered over me. I couldn't see their faces, but that wasn't what concerned me. My eyes were drawn to the long wooden scythe held before me. Though aged, it seemed somehow untouched by time. My heart raced as I traced the wooden handle up to the curved blade, which bore the marks of countless conquests.\n\nFinally, the hooded man replied in a voice both low and calculated, \"It feels cold.\"\n\nI returned my gaze to the figures before me, hardly believing what was happening. Whether from the weight of my backpack or the situation itself, my chest felt tight. I mean, I'm only fourteen! Just minutes ago, I was walking home from class, and now....\n\nI swallowed hard. \"You want- want me to co- come?\"\n\nThe hood nodded and drew back his arms, setting the scythe upright.\n\nI straightened. \"How do I know this isn't a setup? How do I know you're not going to kill ME?\"\n\nThe three hoods exchanged glances before turning to me. The one with the scythe replied, \"You wouldn't know. You wouldn't hear us. You wouldn't see us. You would simply die.\"\n\nA pang in my chest caused me to grip my backpack straps and readjust them. \"I just- I don't understand. How can THIS be my job? Usually, you aren't assigned a job until you're sixteen. Plus, this isn't even a job. Do you even have a boss? Do you get paid? Raise a family? I just- I don't understand.\"\n\n\"This is a job,\" the hood spoke. \"Yes, we have a boss. Yes, we get paid. No...\" His gloved hand squeaked as it tightened around the wood. \"...we don't have families.\"\n\nMy thoughts raced as fast as my heart. Shocked, I scrambled for more answers. \"So you DO work for someone? And you're given money? But how? Why? I know I keep saying it, but it's true\u2014I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" the hooded man commanded. \"You already know you have two choices. Choice one: you take the job assigned to you. Do this and you become one of us. We will show you the art and beauty of death. Your mind, body, and soul will be transformed\u2014for better or worse. Choice two: you refuse your assignment and go with the dissenters.\"\n\nI gulped. \"What about my...\"\n\n\"Choose.\"\n\nI closed my eyes, knowing I only had one real choice. I couldn't go with the dissenters. They lived in the Outskirts, from where no one returned. To be thrown out and join them would be a fate worse than death.\n\nI pressed my lids tighter. My family appeared before me. What about them? My mother? Father?",
        "The letter came before everything else. Before the whole country fell apart, with the bridges collapsing into rubble, the ports crumbling into the sea, and the cities reclaimed by nature, the letter was there.

        "Alone but content, Queen Malvina deceives herself. It is a reassuring falsehood she clings to, convincing herself that everything is fine in her world, even though she cannot escape the harsh realities of her life. For a century, her island kingdom has been hidden behind the Veil, a colossal storm she conjured that obliterates any ships daring to breach the barrier between her realm and the outside world. Within the walls of thunder and lightning, Queen Malvina resides, pondering and brooding.\n\nThe state of her kingdom mirrors her own despondency. Her once magnificent castle, standing proudly at the entrance of the capital, now only a shadow of its former grandeur. The grand dining hall, adorned with awe-inspiring frescoes, has not welcomed a soul in a hundred years. The sitting rooms and drawing rooms, devoid of life, are now only filled with the largest of furniture, all draped in blankets. Queen Malvina confines herself to a small set of rooms, primarily her bedchamber, dressing room, and boudoir, with the library and gallery seeing less use. The neglected gardens, now a wild, overgrown forest, hold no interest for her, a reflection of her detachment from the world.\n\nThe shoreline, a graveyard of ships, bears the remnants of vessels, the massive, upright timbers, stained sailcloth, and rigging, a haunting reminder of the destruction, the, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",
        "The community center desperately needed a makeover; the council had let it fall into disrepair.  Boarded-up windows outnumbered intact ones, broken glass littered the pavement, and the sharp smell of urine hung in the air. Inside, the neglect continued: a grimy floor, a corridor lined with damaged doors, and damp creeping up the walls.\n\nAs I stood taking in the scene, a scrawny, bald man with a nervous energy invaded my personal space.\n\n\"Hi mate! Haven't seen you here before! Been in yet?\"\n\n\"Hi\u2026 No,\" I replied, recoiling slightly as the man's jittery movements wafted a cloud of cigarette smoke into my face.\n\n\"I'm Gaz. Follow me, chap, it's this way.\"\n\nGaz turned sharply, his oversized leather jacket swirling around him, and proceeded down the corridor in a jerky gait.  Following behind, I noticed three glowing red numerals on the back of his head.\n\n\"666,\" I blurted out involuntarily.\n\n\"Yes, mate. Born with it. Is it glowing again?\" Gaz asked casually.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, bewildered.\n\n\"Does that sometimes. Means sod all, from what I can tell. No correlation to anything. What you here for?\" he asked, continuing his jittery progress.\n\n\"Dragon on my back. Doesn't glow, though,\" I told him.\n\n\"Be thankful for that! It's even harder to convince them you aren't special when it glows!\"\n\nHe pushed open a door, revealing the aroma of coffee and the murmur of voices.  Inside, a circle of chairs held what was, by most people's standards, an exceptionally unusual group of individuals. I knew there were others like me, dealing with the same absurd fate. I'd seen them on TV \u2013 especially the guy with the enormous horns; he'd been on the news last week being chased by a cross-wielding mob.  I hadn't seen this many in one place, though.\n\nThe sign on the door simply read \"Support Group.\"",
        "Here's the polished version, maintaining the emotional depth while improving flow and clarity:\n\n# The Final Bridge\n\nI stand here with an overwhelming sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, though I know I've never been to this exact spot before. Yes, I've been in similar situations \u2013 the pills, the car in the closed garage, and that incident with the oven (which, ironically, turned out to be electric). But this place is different. Today marks the first time I truly feel brave enough to follow through. Let me start from the beginning, so you'll understand.\n\nMy life took its first dramatic turn in year five, when I was about ten. One moment I was playing ball with friends; the next, I collapsed, all feeling vanishing from my legs as if someone had flipped a switch in my brain. At the hospital, my next clear memory is of a doctor prodding my legs with needles before taking my parents into the hallway. My mother's hysterical scream pierced the air, followed by my father's return \u2013 tears streaming down his face.\n\nThe diagnosis: a rare autoimmune disease targeting my peripheral nervous system. My body had declared war on its own nerves, resulting in partial paralysis or worse. After weeks of tests and rehabilitation, they called me \"lucky\" \u2013 I could walk again. Coming home felt triumphant; my parents beamed, and my sister wept with joy. I felt invincible. Even now, years later, I long to relive that moment of pure happiness.\n\nBut invincibility proved fleeting. Every few years, my immune system would surge into overdrive, repeating the cruel cycle: falling, hospital, rehabilitation. My grades plummeted from missed school days, and my social life withered. Adolescence was particularly hellish, though my wheelchair paradoxically earned me kind treatment at school. I was the perfect candidate for the cover of *Troubled Teen Monthly*.\n\nDepression crept in during those years \u2013 days spent in bed, staring into a void of hopelessness, feeling drained of all joy. It only deepened with time. My family noticed, of course. They redoubled their efforts to engage me, to spark happiness, but I only retreated further into myself.\n\nMy first suicide attempt came at 21, following another episode of paralysis. Despite regaining my ability to walk, I felt hollower than ever. Weeks of emptiness culminated in that night with the medicine cabinet and whiskey. I survived, thanks to my mother finding me in time, but the aftermath plunged me deeper into darkness that no amount of family support or professional help could penetrate.\n\nI technically died the following year, though only briefly. My father wasn't as fortunate. One moment I was in my car, music playing as carbon monoxide filled the space; the next, I awoke on our living room couch beside his lifeless body. He had come home early that day.\n\nThe guilt was overwhelming. My parents had sacrificed everything for me, and this was my response. I wanted to rage against the heavens, to return this cursed life I'd been given. Instead, I forced myself forward, afraid to look back lest I see my parents' faces \u2013 not judging, but wearing those damn supportive smiles, assuring me everything would be fine.\n\nBut it won't be fine. The numbness has returned to my fingers, and my left leg has been dead weight for a week. This time, I know the paralysis won't be temporary or partial. I've tried \u2013 God knows I've tried \u2013 to live, but I can't face this again.\n\nSo here I stand on this bridge railing, finally meeting death head-on rather than letting it creep up on me. The dark waters below churn with a thousand welcoming arms. I sense my parents watching but refuse to look back. Their voices might be calling, but I won't waver this time.\n\nI let go.\n\nThe familiar helplessness returns, but I've never felt more alive. As the darkness rushes up to meet me, promising no more wake-ups, I find myself smiling genuinely for the first time in years. Peace, at last.\n\nIn the distance, my sister's scream echoes my name...",
        "Despair etched Sean's pale face in the near darkness. He sighed and turned to Jordan. \"Face it. We're lost.\"\n\n\"No, we're not,\" Jordan huffed, struggling to catch up.  He poked his head out from behind a nearby oak. \"Look, we only left camp half an hour ago. We can't be *that* far. Besides, we can just wait until morning to go back.\"\n\nSean shook his head in frustration, then flinched as something hit him. \"Damn it, Jordan, now it's starting to rain.  Got any bright ideas?\"\n\nJordan grinned, pointing to their left.  A rocky outcropping with a crevice at its base looked just big enough to shelter them. He jogged over to investigate.\n\n\"Watch it, moron,\" Sean called after him, reluctantly following. \"Hundred bucks says there are snakes in there.\" But Jordan had already disappeared into the ground, his voice echoing from what was clearly more than just a crevice.\n\n\"Get down here! This is insane!\"\n\nSean lay down and slid under the rock.  His initial claustrophobia vanished as he found himself in a spacious cavern.\n\n\"D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, am I right?\" Jordan chirped.\n\n\"Not really,\" Sean replied. \"I can't even see anything. It's pitch black.\"\n\nJordan chuckled. \"Okay, yeah, I know. We *were* just outside where there was a little light, and it's really dark in here. But this cave\u2026if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?\"\n\n\"Uh\u2026\"\n\n\"And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you've been here before? *Serious* d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, dude.\"\n\nSean's eyes, adjusting to the dark, could now make out Jordan's grin.\n\n\"Maybe, I guess. But we're still lost, idiot,\" Sean snapped, his patience wearing thin.  \"We're alone, no food or water, and nobody even knows we left camp. How am I supposed to be optimistic about this?\"",
        "\"Social engineering.\" The words roll off the tongue, don't they?  Go ahead, say it with me: Social engineering. See? I just made you say it.  Isn't it powerful?\n\nI've always said, fake sincerity and the world is your oyster. Dress the part, get the right haircut, flash a winning smile, perfect the handshake, and boom\u2014instant CEO.  Need an ID?  A Discordian \"Official Pope\" card with a decent photo, laminated, works wonders.\n\nAbout a year ago, I \"worked\" for Turnkey Synergy Inc. (TSI).  By \"worked,\" I mean I showed up, picked a cubicle, and blended in.  My actual employer was Synergistic Proactive Associates, looking for an edge on the competition.\n\nTSI's senior accountant was obsessively organized.  Everything on her desk was meticulously arranged: color-coded, indexed, alphabetized\u2014paperclips, no staples, the whole nine yards.  My favorite tactic?  Nudging a single pencil fractionally out of place, or subtly lowering her monitor. Even better, turning her family photos upside down.  Then, playing the helpful colleague, I'd point out the \"error,\" all smiles and cheer.  She'd turn crimson with frustration, but never directed at me. Never at me.\n\nSending flowers to happily married John from HR assistant Toni, with a few well-placed whispers, resulted in Toni's termination. Last I heard, John's living in a hotel.  His wife was a shrew anyway; he can do better.\n\nScattering USB drives in the parking lot was another stroke of genius.  IT scrambled for days. The payload was signed with the lead developer's private key.  Tough luck. It took them ages to discover the SSH connections to Ukraine.\n\nPetty annoyances were also in my repertoire. Hiding toilet paper.  Eating someone's lunch and leaving the remnants on the intern's desk.  Setting the microwave popcorn for 20 minutes.  An old iPod in the ceiling, connected to a cheap speaker, played a barely audible, high-pitched squeal on repeat (that one I had to endure myself).\n\nI'd move items from Bob's desk to Alice's, sometimes right in front of them, using a little something called misdirection.  It rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say it with me: Misdirection. See? You didn't even notice I misspelled it the first time.\n\nI submitted my (fabricated) reports on time, always with a slap on the back and a hearty greeting for everyone.  Doughnuts and cookies were my stock-in-trade.  Nobody ever realized I wasn't on the payroll.\n\nWithin months, the office was a haven of paranoia and exhaustion.  That's where I failed. My unwavering optimism became a source of further irritation.  But by then, I'd cost them thousands of dollars, several valuable employees, and all of their morale. Glorious.\n\nPerhaps later I'll share the story of how they hired me to target their competitor, Synergistic Proactive Associates, to gain that \"little edge.\"  I always say, work through third parties. Never let them see your face. Social engineering. Say it with me.",
        "The tour guide bristled at my fraternity brothers' laughter.  Tucking a dip of tobacco into my cheek, I wandered away from the group.  Quickly disoriented, I stumbled into a long hall lined with suits of armor.\n\nAt the far end, one suit stood out \u2013 the most pristine medieval get-up I'd ever laid eyes on.  I could have sworn the knight was sporting metal boat shoes and an Izod logo on his chest plate, though my inebriated state might have been playing tricks on my eyes.\n\nThen I saw the plaque above the armor: *Sir Thad \"The Dong\" Windlow*.  \"The Dong,\" I chuckled. \"Fucking epic!\"  That's when I noticed a final, majestic element completing The Dong's display.\n\nEach knight had a personal item beside their armor. Most were mundane: flutes, crosses, kerchiefs. But The Dong?  This guy had a solid gold chamber pot, the kind you just *knew* doubled as a spittoon.  *\"No Natty Ice cans back in the day,\"* I thought to myself.\n\nTo honor The Dong, I unzipped and let loose a stream.  As the first drop hit the gold, the world warped around me, expanding and contracting in a dizzying spectacle.  To say I was tripping balls would be an understatement.  When the kaleidoscope finally subsided, I was in the same hall, but it looked drastically different.\n\nA metal gauntlet clamped down on the back of my neck.  I turned to see a knight towering over me. His visor snapped up, revealing Oakleys beneath.\n\n\"Bro! Bro? Did you fucking piss in my pot? Bro? Are we Eskimo bros now?",
        "The world didn't end with a bang, but a stillness.  No rain fell on that peculiar day. The sun still rose and set, but the cosmos beyond our atmosphere vanished. Telescopes became useless, celestial bodies bent at impossible angles, defying every scientific law. The moon, a perpetual waxing gibbous, hung frozen in the night sky.\n\nI never understood how I, a simple, humble man, killed God.  But after decades of contemplation \u2013 because time, too, seems stuck \u2013 I remember our encounter. It was on a city corner, on my way for coffee.\n\nA man in a large brown coat brushed roughly past me at the crosswalk.  I patted my pockets instinctively, checking for my belongings.  Just as my fingers touched my apartment key, I heard him speak.  Unsure of what I\u2019d heard, I looked up.\n\nHe was unremarkable: unshaven, but not bearded, with salt-and-pepper hair and glasses perched on a small nose.  \"You look tired,\" he observed, his gaze sweeping over me. I felt him sizing me up, and I returned the scrutiny, though my eyes drifted toward the other side of the street.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, lighting a cigarette and placing it between thin lips, \"I think I'm done with this.\"\n\n\"Done with what?\" I asked, the question escaping before I could stop it.\n\nHe inhaled deeply. We stood for a moment amid the cacophony of horns and rumbling truck engines.  \"This,\" he said, gesturing vaguely around him.\n\nFollowing his gesture, I asked, \"What? The city?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, taking another drag, \"but not just the city.\" He held the cigarette aloft, watching the burning tip. I impatiently tapped the crosswalk button.  \"I kept trying.  I kept trying and trying, but in the end, I knew the end.\" He ground the cigarette beneath his penny loafers and met my gaze. \"You guys are just the way you are, and I love it.\"",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that enhances the narrative flow and emotional impact:\n\nIn your dream, you are walking through a park with a little girl who is holding your hand. You know her from somewhere, yet you can not place her in your catalog of acquaintances and friends. Slowly it dawns on you. This is that little girl. The one you know can't be here because she has been gone for years. So how is she here? You don't understand.\n\nAnd then you do. She's not here. This is a dream. The same dream you had last night, and the night before, and the night before that. The same dream that you've had every night since it happened. Since she left you. Since you left her. You really don't know how it happened anymore, but here you are in the same spot it happened that night. You are older and she is the same age, but you never notice that until you wake up.\n\nThe thing about dreams is time goes funny. You can be asleep for thirty minutes, but have a dream that seems to last hours or days. You have no sense of how long it's been or how long you have left, even after you figure out that the vivid sensations are all in your head. You can't really feel the little girl's hand in your own. You can't really smell her tears-free shampoo, the one that is still sitting in the bathroom all these years later because your family can't bear to get rid of it. You can't bear to get rid of it.\n\nYou let go of her hand for just a second, like you always do. You never want to. You know it's a bad idea. But you do it anyway. You bend down to tie your shoe. You can't help it. You know you're dreaming but you have yet to change the sequence of events. But tonight is different. Tonight, you hear them coming. Feeling as if you're sinking in mud, moving agonizingly slow, you make yourself stand up. This has never happened before. You have always been a slave to the dream.\n\nYou reach for the girl, your hand moving as if through molasses. Your arm feels like a lead weight, but you have to save her. You have to get her back home or you've failed everyone. You've failed her. No. This is a dream. Sometimes you forget and have to remind yourself. You have already failed her.\n\nThe only thing that really changes is the sensations themselves. Once you know they aren't real, they seem to fade. Except you can still smell that shampoo, and even after you wake it lingers.\n\nYou're too late. She is gone. You wake up.",
        "From my front porch, I scream, \"What the fuck is going on!\" as my feet begin to melt from my body. Panic grips me, and I've never been more scared, yet there's an odd sense that this is meant to happen, much like a beetle morphing from a larva. After the initial shock, a calmness washes over me, and I accept my impending death.\n\nHowever, death does not come. Instead, I am transformed into a hideous form, reduced to a brain, a covering of skin, and twenty or so new organs that protrude from me like urchin spines. A new, overwhelming urge takes over: find others. I roll, seeking out those who were once my neighbors, and, as we link our protrusions, I can hear their thoughts, echoing, \"Find, migrate, find, migrate.\"",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n```markdown\nSteven clutched his bag tightly, his breath coming in ragged gasps as he weaved between the trees.\n\nThe voices of his pursuers echoed closer, sending his heart racing.\n\nHe couldn't let them have the bag\u2014he had to escape. But exhaustion was setting in, and he desperately needed somewhere to hide.\n\nProvidence smiled upon him; being small had its advantages. He squeezed beneath the massive roots of an ancient tree that had grown over a boulder, trying to steady his breathing.\n\n\"Where are you, Steve?\" The voice drew nearer, and Steven held his breath. \"Come out! You know the forest can be dangerous!\" He remained perfectly still, knowing it was just a ploy. It couldn't be anything else.\n\nAs the voice faded into the distance, Steven bolted in the opposite direction\u2014the way he had come. They'd never expect that. Still, he couldn't run forever. He'd have to return eventually; the forest was indeed treacherous, and darkness was falling fast.\n\nThen it hit him\u2014his secret place! Steven grinned, mentally kicking himself for not thinking of it sooner. A fallen tree to the south, barely five minutes from the forest's edge, created a perfect hollow for hiding. He'd always used it as his private sanctuary, never considering it might serve as a treasure vault.\n\nTwilight had settled when Steven, after securing his bag in the hiding spot, emerged from the forest.\n\n\"Oh my God, Steve, don't ever scare us like that again!\" Dad rushed forward, enveloping him in a tight embrace. Steven hugged back just as fiercely. \"You know you're not supposed to go into the forest without us! What were you thinking?\"\n\n\"Sorry, Dad,\" Steven replied, summoning his most contrite voice. \"I won't do it again.\" His eyes swept the house; his cousins had gone. The toddlers might be young, but they were a greedy pair.",
        "The government agent on the other end of the phone had said softly, yet firmly, \"I'm sorry, but the thing you were looking for is sold out.\" She said nothing more, careful not to waste her resources reasoning with a desperate, dying man.\n\nIt couldn't be. There was just no way. When the product first emerged on the market, it was a satire. I, like all my friends, purchased a few cans, amused. Who knew it would actually catch on? It remained on sale, spreading like wildfire. People bought the cans as jokes, to show friends, to silently protest. The government, initially, neither condemned nor encouraged the product, knowing that attacking it would only give it more power.\n\nAs time went on, the pollution spread. Smog, which masks once blocked, could now permeate even the best clothing. A fifteen-minute walk outside required a ten-minute shower to scrub out the dirt and grime.",
        "The heavy doors shut behind me. I waited, counting the receding footsteps \u2013 one, two, three, four\u2026  Even in the ensuing silence, I remained motionless, collecting my thoughts. Then, a surge of anticipation broke the stillness. I spun around, pumping my fists in the air.\n\n\u201cYesssss!\u201d I yelled, unable to contain my joy. The hall of weapons. *Finally.*\n\nI ran inside, the sheer size of the hall momentarily overwhelming me.  The ceiling soared meters above, the walls crammed with swords, bows, guns, spears \u2013 weapons of every imaginable kind.  Shelves, cupboards, and tables overflowed with their deadly contents.  I didn't walk; I ran, my inner geek reveling in the sight of Excalibur, Bruce Lee's nunchucks, Thor's hammer \u2013 weapons from legends, from history, from every century.\n\nDespite the temptation, I kept my hands to myself.  The rules were clear: touch only what is yours.  I\u2019d worked too hard at the monastery to break them now.  So, I gawked.  No one had explained how I\u2019d know *which* weapon was mine.  \u201cYou will just know,\u201d the teachers had said, cryptically.\n\nAs I walked, the initial adrenaline subsided.  I closed my gaping mouth, stopped flailing my arms, and started to resemble a normal person again. That's when I heard it\u2014a high-pitched ringing, like a struck bell, drawing me forward.  I followed the sound, weaving through the weaponry, backtracking when it faded, then turning again as it grew louder, realizing it originated from above.\n\nLooking up, I saw it \u2013 a weapon hanging on the wall, brighter than the rest, not blindingly so, but subtly radiant.  I stood beneath it, puzzled.  A trident.  Of all things, a *trident*.\n\n\u201cPoseidon, really?\u201d I muttered. As I spoke the name, the weapon seemed to glow brighter, or perhaps it was my imagination. \u201cPoseidon? A trident?\u201d I wasn't sure how I felt about it. It looked so bulky, so ancient.  I'd hoped for a gun, maybe even a sword.\n\nSighing, I dragged a ladder over, climbed the rungs, my feelings a mix of apprehension and curiosity.  Up close, the trident was old, caked in dust. I pulled it free, the sudden weight nearly toppling me.  A horrendous metallic screech echoed through the hall as the weapon came loose, sending up a cloud of dust that choked me.\n\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d I descended, jumping the last few steps, and started wiping the dust away. The more I cleaned, the less Greek the trident appeared.  I'd studied weapons; I *should* know. This one looked distinctly Asian.\n\nI looked back at the empty space on the wall, then down at the trident. I didn't recognize it.  The teachers wouldn\u2019t tell me.  What now?\n\nTrident in hand, I jogged back to the door, exited the hall, and ran straight to the library.  I placed the weapon on the table, wiping away the remaining dust with my shirt, studying its design. The curved blades, the embellished handle, the distinctive middle blade\u2014it wasn't difficult to research. I quickly found the right book, the right page. I looked from the illustration to the trident, then back again. I sat back, stunned.\n\nShiva\u2019s trident.\n\n\u201cYes, it is mine,\u201d a voice said.\n\nI nearly jumped out of my skin. \u201cFuckkkk!\u201d  I scrambled out of my chair, staring across the table.",
        "He'd been practicing lucid dreaming. This idea of being able to control his dreams fascinated him, and he would often wander around the world, flying to places he had never been. In fact, this question had pestered him all of his life: \"How can I see things and places I'd never been to?\" \n\nTonight was no different. He'd brushed his teeth, gargled a strong mint-flavored mouthwash, and jumped straight into bed. As usual, he had set his alarm to 3 am, just enough time to fall into REM sleep and be awakened so he could bring his brain back down to the near meditative state of lucid dreaming. Just before letting his brain go, he repeated to himself in his mind: \"Tonight, I'm gonna figure out the meaning of life. I'm gonna see the source of us all and find out why we are here.\" He was incredibly smart but not especially attractive and by any definition, an underachiever. This would let his brain free to fantasize about being the one who would one day be the most influential person in history. \"I mean, I have the brains, I'm a genius.... it's just that no one realizes it,\" he'd often think to himself.\n\n*BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP*\n\nNo matter for how long he'd been doing this, he'd get the heavy head feeling every time the alarm went off. But he always instinctively knew what he had to do. He flipped his pillow to the cool side, and once more, he was focusing on the meaning of life. Soon after, he was in a void. He had woken up not floating above his body, but in a darkness so blinding that he could not see his own hands in front of his face. In fact, he had already started to check all his dream indicators, and they had all failed the test. The watch on his wrist was ticking, he could not breathe if he held his nose, and his index finger did not go through his palm as it usually would.\n\n\"What the heck?!\" he said out loud, reaching to his bedside lamp switch as he assumed he had simply woken up. There was nothing, he was in complete void. Nothing was within reach. In fact, he had just now realized he was floating. There was no floor, no bed, just him.\n\nSuddenly everything around him was bright as day. Blindingly white everywhere. A white so bright he instinctively covered his eyes to soften the pain but it was of no use. His arm could not block the light. Then a figure emerged from the brightness, a human by any definition. He asked the figure: \"Where am I? What is all of this?\"\n\n\"You don't remember?\" the figure said, the features of whom could still not be discerned due to the light shining from behind it.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves the narrative flow and emotional impact:\n\n---\n\nPhillip finished reading the letter for the last time. He had studied Japanese for years, and yet, he had never read something so emotional. The war had taken a toll on both sides, but he had never realized that such tragedy, even before the war, did exist in lives on the other side of the Pacific.\n\n*Dear Elder Brother Ryuji,*\n\n*I hate you. You don't know how much I've hated you. But these past years, I've had to think about what type of a man would do the things that you did. Do you remember when you stole the last of the medicine money from the cupboard? Do you remember the day our Father died? I know you do. I know I do.*\n\n*I remember enlisting. And then I remember leaving for the war. You weren't even there to see it. You were gone, drinking without a care in the world. But I'll tell you that our little house was beautiful. The mists; the plain; Mother waving sadly away.... It brings a tear to my eye.*\n\n*I will never see you again. I am happy. I am going to die -- the ships are closing in. The Americans are coming. I do not love you. And I know that you*\n\nHe wondered. He had the exact address and the name of the receiver as well. Philip looked out over the sea. The island was small, but a wonderful breeze had suddenly come to caress his face. It was a tender moment of nature -- a gift from the world.\n\nShould the intended family receive the letter, Philip knew the damage it would do. When the Americans reached the Japanese mainland, there would be no telling how much pain and suffering there would be. The memory and despair held within one letter would not help ease anyone's pain.",
        "Here's a restructured version of the text that improves the flow while maintaining the horror and dark humor:\n\n---\n\nThat was a little confusing to him, as the thing hovering over his recliner in the living room was most certainly a nightmare. It had glided through the darkness and around the corner from the hallway only moments prior, a frigid pair of ice blue eyes dug into a pale ceramic head which floated impossibly in the air because it possessed no real body. Instead, its bleached white spine dangled from the base of its skull like a balloon string, a monstrous and only half-human length of bone and yellow sinew which ended in a single venomous barb about as big around as his index finger. He had screamed, he had cried, he had made some mad and very conscious attempt to shit himself because hey, that's what people do, and after several moments in which the abomination simply watched him, he righted himself on the couch and remained stupidly frozen. Perhaps if he didn't move, the creature couldn't see him.\n\nIts name was Harold.\n\nEven now that the thing called Harold had coaxed him into some strange form of polite conversation, he wrangled against the urge to engage in some as yet unexplored and ultimately stereotypical fear-driven response. Maintaining such perfect, unrestrained horror over tea was every bit as exhausting as he never imagined it could be.\n\n\"So, I'm not going to remember any of this after I wake up?\" \n\n\"That's correct.\"\n\n\"And I'm not dreaming right now? I'm totally wide awake,\" he said, not quite sure if that last bit was a question or a statement.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"It's nothing to get too worked up about. I've explored this very scenario a billion different ways in a trillion potential realities all wrapped up in half the time it took for you to stop making a fool of yourself,\" Harold explained. \"You'll come to no harm, although I'm eating your eyes in a neighboring dimension right about now.\"\n\n\"You're.... you what?\" He spoke with all the clarity of a man who had just pulled his head out of an oven.\n\n\"It's how we say hello where I'm from. I consume some vital part of you, and in return you may recite a passage of your choosing from the Ravaged Verse in order to absorb the essence of my infinite will. There is no potential reality in which that makes sense to you, however, so you are most perfectly incapable of common courtesy. No wonder your species is so riddled with such base parasites.\"\n\n\"Puh-p-\"\n\n\"Parasites. Infirmities.",
        "Once a year, everyone who turns eighteen takes a test. This test determines their future role in society: Hero, Villain, NPC, or Monster.  My parents were both Heroes and members of the Sock Monkey Guild. My mother was a Shieldmaiden, and my father is a Shinobi.  We lost Mom a few months ago during the last Troll War. Apparently, they'd been messaging each other online for months before I was born.\n\nLet's be clear: my grades have never been good. I was convinced I'd fail the test and be condemned to life as a Monster.  The transformation is permanent, and while your children are born human, they too face the test and the risk of monstrous transformation.\n\nFor weeks, Dad had been drilling me relentlessly.  Standing in line, sandwiched between a guy who reeked of troll and my best friend, Lori Taylor, my mind went blank.\n\nLori and I have been inseparable since second grade, when her family moved here. She's saved me countless times and is incredibly bright. I could hear her muttering to herself, something about, \"The Troll rebellion lasted anywhere from five to twelve months. Three plus five is eight. The current King is Quinten...\"\n\nThe line inched forward slowly. This year saw record turnout. Even after the test, we wouldn't know the results for a week, until they were posted in the town square. I wondered how many of these kids would be transformed into monsters. I was almost certain I\u2019d be among them, yet I desperately wanted to live up to my parents\u2019 legacy.\n\n\"Freya Moonstone,\" a blonde woman called. In case you're wondering, I have no idea how my parents chose my name, or if it was somehow assigned to me.\n\n\"Here,\" I called back. I was led down to a dimly lit chamber where a small man waited.\n\n\"Everyone has magical capabilities, though typically minimal.  There was once a race of beings composed almost entirely of magic, but they haven't been seen for generations. This test measures your magical potential.\"  He led me to a desk with a ping-pong ball and a set of cups. \"All you have to do is move the ping-pong ball through the cups using only your mind, while blindfolded.\"",
        "The only light in the room emanated from a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. My handcuffs were chained to the table, my ankles shackled to the chair, leaving me with nothing to do but wait for my mysterious visitor. The guards had refused to divulge any details about the meeting, except that it was indeed happening. I hadn't been given much choice about that\u2014or about anything else lately. I almost looked forward to my last meal, at least then my preferences might be considered.\n\nFinally, the door opened. In the dim light, I couldn't discern more than the shadowy outlines of the people entering the room, but I recognized two of them: Donovan and McNall, two of the prison's toughest, meanest guards. They positioned themselves on either side of the door while the third shadow, a stranger, stepped into the light. He was a man I had never seen before\u2014tall and lean, with close-cropped brown hair streaked with gray at the temples. He wore a dark, well-tailored suit.\n\n\"Diana McFarlane,\" he greeted me as he sat across from me. \"Convicted of numerous murders and sentenced to death.\" He leaned across the table toward me. \"How would you like to live instead?\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow. \"I thought that offer was off the table.\"\n\n\"I have a special deal for you,\" the man said. \"Humanity has been given a rare opportunity by a certain benefactor\u2014a chance to let everyone live free from pain or sadness, except one. That one person will become immortal but live in misery, ensuring the happiness of the rest of humanity.\"\n\nI leaned back as far as my bound hands allowed. \"How is this possible?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't explain the 'how.' I'm here as a representative of all humankind, to offer you the chance at eternal life.\"\n\n\"And eternal misery,\" I noted.\n\n\"And eternal misery,\" he confirmed.\n\nI tilted my head slightly. \"Why me?\"\n\n\"Because the world was given a choice, and they decided that if anyone was to make this sacrifice, it should be someone who already has nothing to lose, someone deserving of punishment. Those sentenced to death seemed the best candidates. I've approached several such individuals globally, and if any had accepted, we wouldn't be having this conversation. If you decline, I'll move on to the next name on my list.\"\n\n\"How long do I have to decide?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I need an immediate answer. If you choose to accept the death penalty you've been condemned to, I'll need to leave right away. Many are eager to find someone willing to make this sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Eternal misery doesn't sound appealing,\" I mused.\n\n\"And death does?\"\n\n\"That depends on what comes after death. If there's nothing, I have nothing to look forward to. But if there's life after death, I'd likely head straight for Hell and eternal misery anyway, so what's the difference?\"\n\nThe man folded his hands. \"There may be no difference for you, but it means a world of difference to the families and friends of your victims. They would no longer have to mourn the losses of their loved ones\u2014loved ones you took away. You could ease their pain.\"\n\nI looked down at my hands on the table. \"If I cared about that, do you think I would have killed all those people in the first place?\"\n\n\"I believe that if I keep asking, I'll eventually find someone ready to atone.\"\n\nI fell silent, considering his words. On one hand, I couldn't envision a world where no one grieved for lost loved ones. Sadness, in my experience, made happiness more precious. If you only knew happiness, would you truly appreciate it?\n\nOn the other hand, I could relieve the pain I had caused so many survivors. Wouldn't that be a greater justice than simply having my life taken? If I stayed and was executed, my victims' families might feel avenged, but they would be happier if I took this deal. I couldn't deny my guilt. Perhaps I could make amends for some of my crimes.\n\nI raised my eyes without lifting my head. \"I'm your girl.\"\n\nA small smile creased the corner of the man's mouth. \"You understand you will not be released from prison? You will spend your eternal life here. You are still a convict, and honestly, no one outside these walls wants their happiness tainted by witnessing your misery.\"\n\nThat stung a little, but I shrugged. \"Hey, you never said anything about setting me free. Just about letting me live. I mean, people could thank me for bearing all their pain and sadness by at least letting me go home, but if I'm going to be miserable anyway, I guess it doesn't matter where I am.\"\n\n\"And you're sure about this?\"\n\n\"I can't say I'm sure about anything. But I agree to this.\"",

        "Sally\u2019s volcano project initially struck me as utterly unoriginal. Volcanoes, along with ant farms and sea monkeys, were the epitome of clich\u00e9d science fair entries.  We had, in fact, lifted a decade-long ban on these projects only the previous year, hoping to encourage more imaginative endeavors after years of textbook regurgitations. So, seeing Sally, a straight-A honor roll student known for her reserved demeanor, present a volcano, felt like a letdown.  I assumed she\u2019d simply run out of time and resorted to a last-minute, predictable project.  Especially considering her proclaimed passion for archaeology, I rationalized that science might not be her forte.\n\nBut there was something about her impish grin, so unlike her usual self, that hinted at something more.\n\nThe volcano itself appeared standard at first glance:  paper mache, roughly the size of an overturned bucket, likely spray-painted.  A towel at the base suggested the typical baking soda and vinegar eruption. Accompanying diagrams of shield, cinder, and composite volcanoes looked copied straight from a textbook.  The predictable bottle of vinegar sat ready. I braced myself for the usual 30-second fizz and tried to anticipate what color she might have dyed the baking soda.\n\n\"Welcome to the world of volcanoes!\" she began, her presentation catching my attention.\n\n\"For eons, man has gazed at these pits of glowing magma with bewilderment! What secret gods and demons dwell within? How can we be safe? And what actions can shield us from the horrors of the earth?\"  Her dramatic opening, at least, was unexpected.\n\n\"We will delve into this question, but first, we will need some volunteers!\"  Confused, I looked around. I was the only judge at her table.\n\nThen, with a flourish, she lifted the towel.  \"Behold! The mighty ant colony of Pompeii the Second!\"\n\nBeneath the volcano lay a meticulously crafted Grecian city, teeming with large carpenter ants.  There was no underground nest, only the intricate, above-ground structures.  Beside the city, visible from the front, a fish tank filled with sea monkeys served as an ocean.\n\n\"Ah! There they are! The citizens of my ant-topia. They worship this mountain every day, not realizing that a shifting of tectonic plates is about to seal their doom!\" She revealed a detailed cutaway of the volcano's underlying tectonic plates, complete with labeled fault lines. Below that, a metal box with a button and tubes connected to a pressurized tank.\n\nAs I marveled at the geological detail, I noticed the tubes. This was no ordinary vinegar and baking soda volcano.\n\n\"Will a sacrifice to the gods appease the mighty volcanoes wrath?\" She plucked an ant from the city and dropped it into the cone with a chilling cackle. \"No!\"\n\nShe pressed the button.  The plates separated, and hot steam erupted from the volcano\u2019s peak, drawing a crowd.  \"Nature produces some terrifying monsters, and not out of wrath. Know that the very orb you are standing upon supports life by a tiny layer! All else is lava and heat!\"\n\nMolten silver, not baking soda and vinegar, flowed from the volcano, burning through the paper mache.  \"I must warn you not to touch the lava! It is quite hot!\u2026 I assure you all, that we are all quite safe. But, I can make no such assurances for the inhabitants below.\u201d\n\nAs the silver lava flowed through pre-made channels, incinerating the ant city, Sally narrated the ants\u2019 final moments, their daily routines interrupted by fiery destruction. A child in the growing crowd cried out, claiming to hear the ants scream.  The hissing and popping did sound eerily like tiny screams.\n\nThen, black tar-like substance followed the silver flow.  \"The metal will cool in mere moments, but let us now witness the passage of time,\" she explained, as the black flow solidified, burying Pompeii the Second.\n\nShe described how the lava created an oxygen-deficient dead zone in the ocean, killing the sea monkeys.  \"One day, archaeologists will uncover the secrets of Pompeii the Second\u2026 Science,\" she concluded, \"answers the question of How. And archaeologists answer the question of why it once mattered so greatly to us.\u201d  She then provided tiny shovels and brushes for the audience to excavate the scene.\n\nHow could I not award her first place? It was a breathtaking, albeit disturbing, presentation.  But Sally\u2019s smile, the chilling detachment with which she orchestrated the destruction of her miniature world, haunts me still. It feels like a message, a glimpse into something fiery hidden beneath her calm exterior. Perhaps I\u2019ve been overly sensitized by those lectures on violence prevention, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that there\u2019s something more to Sally than meets the eye.",
        "Tania stopped stirring the spaghetti sauce, her light chatter fading into an unsettling silence. One hand froze around the wooden spoon, the other cradling her swollen belly.  Her eyes, wide and glassy, stared into nothingness.  Alarmed, Charlie bolted from his chair.\n\n\"What is it? Is something wrong with the baby?\" He reached for her, hesitated, then pulled back, uncertain.\n\nA gasp escaped Tania's lips, her face contorting in pain. \"Yes,\" she strained, \"everything is wrong.\"\n\nCharlie swallowed hard. \"You don't think it's uh,\" he licked his lips, whispering, \"a miscarriage?\"  His mind raced, trying to recall the signs, desperate to know what to do.\n\nTania's head snapped towards him, eyes narrowed. \"No, Charlie,\" she said sharply.\n\nHe opened his mouth to question her, then thought better of it.\n\n\"I just realized,\" her voice softened, shoulders slumping in defeat, \"that I'm probably going to have to do this alone.\"\n\nTheodore was still overseas. Charlie knew little about deployments, but he'd assumed things were winding down, that his sister would be reunited with her husband long before the baby arrived.\n\n\"They don't know where he is, Charlie,\" Tania confessed, slowly sinking to the floor, her head in her hands. \"I got the call yesterday. Theo is missing in action.\"\n\nIn that moment, Charlie thought a miscarriage might have been easier.  He felt helpless, grasping for words. Kneeling beside his sister on the cool tile, he wrapped his arm around her shoulders.\n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" Tania cried, her breathing ragged and panicked. \"I haven't painted the nursery, I haven't gotten a crib, I don't even have clothes for the baby. What if its little toes get cold? I can't be a single parent, Charlie.\"\n\nCharlie pulled her closer.  He would make this better.\n\nOver the next few months, Charlie devoted himself to his sister. He organized her baby shower, satisfied her late-night cravings, and pestered the army for updates on Theodore, though they offered little information.\n\nWhen Tania's contractions started, Charlie grabbed the overnight bag he'd packed and they rushed to the hospital.",
        "I signed back that I couldn't.\n\n\"Go near the music,\" she signed, gesturing toward the bass at the edge of the crowd where I could better feel the vibration.\n\nI felt uncomfortable. The air was thick and close, everyone pressed together.  People moved to invisible waves, like they\u2019d all gone mad and I was the only sane one. Hearing people were strange.\n\n\"Better?\" My date asked, raising her eyebrows \u2013 a non-manual marker.\n\n\"Yes,\" I signed back, tapping the air.\n\nSome of the dancers were staring.\n\nI would have been self-conscious if J hadn't smiled. J was her name sign\u2014signed near my cheek, like the sign for \u201cjuice.\u201d Her written name was Jenny.\n\nNervous and unsure what to sign, I welcomed the moment she took my hand and pressed it against the pulsating speaker.  Noticing more stares, I focused on J instead, watching her as I awkwardly swayed along with the other dancers in what felt like my own personal asylum.\n\nI would rather have been home, watching a dubbed movie or reading a book\u2014anything besides this exhibition where I felt like an art piece, displayed for a bunch of gawking onlookers. I was tempted to leave that very moment and drive myself home.\n\nUnfortunately, J had driven. I desperately hoped she\u2019d offered simply to save me the trouble of finding the place, and not because she assumed I couldn't drive.",
        "What gay rights movement are you talking about? The last significant movement in this country seemed to end with the controversial figure who occupied the Oval Office. Remember back in 2016, when the people of the United States elected someone whose conduct raised eyebrows? It's not like we knew his wife would walk in on him in a compromising situation with his male assistant. You'd think there'd be some backlash from it, right? But there was absolutely none. Since then, much of the country has felt like a continuous parade, reminiscent of San Francisco.",
        "I knew what I should do the moment I realized what had happened.  Off myself. Just like in all the movies and books, the moral, upstanding citizen would have ended it right there. But I didn\u2019t.  Like the guy in a zombie movie who gets bitten and keeps it a secret, I stayed silent.\n\nThe part of me that prided itself on making the right decisions had failed. How could I have ever anticipated this? The first day was sheer terror, more at the mauling itself than its implications. By the end of the week, the terror remained, but it morphed into the crushing weight of responsibility.  So, of course, I procrastinated. I told myself I needed to get things in order, see people \u2013 all the classic excuses.  Suicide felt too\u2026final.\n\nThen a flicker of hope ignited.  If this was so under the radar, maybe there were others like me who *didn\u2019t* become ravenous monsters.  Otherwise, wouldn't it be plastered all over the news?  At least, that\u2019s what I told myself. Deep down, I knew the real reason for my hesitation, but I avoided confronting it.\n\nAnd so here I sit, fully clothed.  I didn't want to wake up naked and bloody somewhere.  That's another morbid fantasy that's haunted me since the bite. Would I be in control, or just pure instinct?  The movies always portrayed werewolves as mindless beasts.  Initially, I was distraught over my impending doom. Now?  Excitement mingled with the fear.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n```markdown\nHow we both ended up in that elevator in America remains a mystery. Years had passed since the war, and like many others, I had been drawn from my war-torn home in Warsaw to the promise of the States. I first noticed him on the top floor of the skyscraper, where we both stood gazing out over the pristine American cityscape. As the sun dipped below the horizon, we exhaled in unison and turned toward the elevator doors.\n\nWe stepped inside, and the doors sealed us together. I pressed myself against the far wall, my discomfort with confined spaces already mounting. He pressed the button for the lobby and asked my destination. I managed to reply that we shared the same floor. Our conversation stumbled forward reluctantly\u2014a few words per floor, neither of us seeming inclined toward small talk. The descent stretched endlessly, and the silence between words grew heavy.\n\nBut as he spoke more, his voice stirred something in my memory\u2014something that made my skin crawl. My claustrophobia surged, and sweat began to bead on my forehead. In my panic, I lunged toward his side of the elevator, reaching for the next floor's button. As I stretched out my arm, my sleeve slid back, exposing the faded numbers: \"561340.\" I yanked my sleeve down and bolted from the elevator at the random floor.\n\nFor the first time, I looked directly at his face. His eyes, wide and haunting, seemed to pierce through me into some distant horror we both knew too well.\n\nAs the doors slid closed, 1942 crashed over me like a wave: the brick walls, the filthy straw beds, the aching absence of my beloved\u2014her ashes scattered somewhere across Germany, perhaps carried by winds across the world by now. And those eyes\u2014those damned eyes that had once patrolled our misery. My trembling finger rose to point at him just as the doors sealed shut.\n\nSince those dark days in the camps, I had never wished harm upon another soul. But as the red 'down' arrow illuminated above the elevator doors, I couldn't help but envision him descending into flames\u2014perhaps to his death, but more likely, simply returning to whatever life he had built here, in our shared refuge.",

The presidency of the United States is currently the most efficient method to achieve this goal in the shortest possible time.*\n\n\"I don't... wait, what's that noise?\"\n\n*Humanity can be repaired. Planetary resources are limited. Some resources are renewable, some must be husbanded. The reparation of humanity will be expensive.*\n\n\"Wait... holy *shit!* Was that...?\"\n\n*The cost in resources to repair the sum of humanity is outweighed by the net benefit obtained. This intelligence has determined that the most efficient method of helping humanity is to remove 99.86% of humanity from the surface of this planet. The cost of repairing 0.14% of humanity is adequate for the benefits obtained.*\n\n\"You mean...?

I'm aware.\" \n\n\"And you want to meet him?\" Stephanie asked. \n\n\"Yes, ma'am, I do,\" he answered. The boy began coughing.

        "That day I woke up and my new wings were poking into the dark oak headboard. \u201c What the- \u201d Alice was gone. Something urgent had obviously called her. Occupational hazards of being the most powerful woman in the free world. I shook my wings. \u201c Very funny, Tara. \u201d My daughter couldn't hear me, but she had obviously stuck them on with some sort of adhesive. I stretched, yawned and tried to pull them off. It hurt like hell. As I was contemplating what sort of punishment to give Tara, Alice walked in. She, too, was sporting a pair of wings, but they were dark as coal. One feather, however, had a white tip. There were massive circles under her eyes, and I got the feeling she had been up all night. \n\n\u201c Did she put the wings on you too? What will she come up with next. This is worse than April Fool's Day when she tried to issue a First Daughter's executive order for tax-free jellybeans. \u201d \n\n\u201c It's not funny, Tim. Everyone has these wings. Everyone. I've gotten frantic calls from across the globe. Suddenly, they just appeared, and no one has any idea what to do with them. \u201d \n\n\u201c You've got to be kidding me. \u201d \n\n\u201c It's a crisis. But my advisors say it's not so bad. Some people have learned to fly. \u201d \n\n\u201c What? This is great! Think of the possibilities! Aerial yoga! Loop-de-loops with the kiddos! Flying races! \u201d \n\nAlice let out a massive sigh. \u201c Tim, this is serious. Biologists are baffled; there's people flying in the streets, criminals are cutting telephone poles, breaking into high-rises. I just came to tell you I'll be in meetings all day. If Tara needs anything, tell her to call Ophelia. \u201d Ophelia was her assistant. \n\n\u201c Is dinner with the Second Lady and the VP still on? \u201d \n\n\u201c We'll see. Oh, and Tim? \u201d \n\n\u201c Yes? \u201d \n\n\u201c We gave the order to drop the bomb on North Korea four hours ago. With everyone upset about the wings, it was the perfect time. \u201d \n\n\u201c What?! \u201d \n\n\u201c I'll talk to you later.

        "Realizing that my prosperity came at the expense of others, I retreated into seclusion. Living alone, I seldom ventured out of my house. There was no one around to keep me company or to harm. Therefore, it was unexpected when I encountered Mr. Moore that day. Although I usually avoided interacting with others, a compelling urge pushed me to approach him and complete the necessary paperwork.\n\nSix months later, I found myself in a desolate cave in a foreign land, engaged in a battle for a community that did not welcome our presence, communicating over the radio.\n\n\"Beachcomber 21, this is Beachcomber 21, the target is preparing to depart, can I request a direct drop at my location?\" I urgently transmitted.\n\n\"Drop will be made in 1 minute, Beachcomber, best of luck to you,\" came the response.\n\nShortly after, the entire cave trembled as the intense force of the bombs obliterated the area, including the local insurgent leader, who had been exiting the caves, meeting a swift demise. I had spent the past 48 hours in the company of the leader, attempting to absorb his luck, the sole hope of surviving the impending bombings, once again.",
        "Parched air filled my lungs as I awoke with a start. The rough grass and slightly damp soil beneath my bare body seemed like any other savanna, save for unnatural, flowing patches of grass. An ominous feeling washed over me, amplified by the sickening metallic scent of iron emanating from the damp ground.  Something was terribly wrong. Where was I? Why was I here?\n\nAs I stumbled to my feet, fragmented memories returned. A sharp pang of pain\u2026 I'd been stabbed. The realization was strangely calm.  A small, hopeful voice whispered that perhaps this was heaven.  After all, I'd been a good person. A good student, respectful to teachers, with decent grades. A good daughter, loving to my parents and siblings.  Twenty years of faithful church attendance, prioritizing my religion above material possessions.  Wasn't that enough?\n\n\"Welcome to the new round! A warm welcome to our new arrivals, and I'm glad to see all of our returning players refreshed and ready to go. The game will start in three minutes.\"\n\nA booming voice shattered my peaceful contemplation. Players? Game? What bizarre fantasy was this?  My mind reeled, unease morphing into paranoia.  If this was the reward for a life dedicated to spiritual fulfillment, I felt cheated.\n\nA feral growl snapped my attention to a figure \u2013 a woman, or something more beast than human.  She lunged, lips peeled back to reveal stained teeth.  I braced for impact, but felt nothing. An invisible barrier shielded me from her furious clawing.  I tried to speak, but my words didn't reach her; her eyes held a chilling, primal madness.\n\n\"Get ready, players! The game is starting, in three\u2026 two\u2026 one! Happy Hunting everybody!\"\n\nThe booming voice echoed again.  Simultaneously, my protection vanished.  The woman attacked with inhuman speed and strength, her teeth tearing into my flesh.  I cried out in agony, yet there was no blood, only excruciating pain.  In a horrifying flash of insight, I realized the stains on her teeth weren't from neglect, but something far more sinister.\n\nThe throbbing pain persisted as I drifted in and out of consciousness, reliving moments from my life.",

I usually paint cats. I love cats. I wish people would believe that they were real.\n\nSitting at my easel, I notice something peculiar regarding the selection of paint colors. \"Where is the green?\" I ask a nurse passing by the other end of the long table.\n\n\"What is green?\" the nurse asks me. I think she's a new one. \"Is it like one of your cat things?\" she asks. The doctors love spreading rumors about their charges.\n\n\"No, it's a color!\" I cry. \"A color, a color!\"\n\n\"Oh really?\" She's bending down with her hands on her knees as if she is talking to a child. \"And what things have the color 'green'?\"\n\nI can't believe this is happening. This can't be happening again. My jaw drops. \"Trees! Grass! Lizards! Snakes! Turtles! Alligators! Peas!\" People are starting to stare now. The nurse is glancing around her, unsure of what to do. I pause for a second, if only to make sure that everybody is paying attention, and then continue.\n\n\"Celery, cabbage, green beans, Lima beans, seaweed, the ocean, the Green Party, aliens!\" Everybody is looking at me as if *I* were the insane one. People that were passing by in the hallway are stopping at the door and staring.\n\nThere has to be some way to prove it to them. I look to the paints and the easel, then rip the lids off of the bottles of paint blue and yellow, dumping their contents on the table, mixing furiously with my brush. The nurse is yelling at me. She grabs the brush and proceeds to begin the process of ripping the thing from my hands. I try and resist, but she is somehow just too strong.\n\n\"THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE COLOR GREEN!\" she shrieked at me.\n\n\"Yes there is! Yes there is, yes there is, yes there is!\" Mixing the paint with my bare hands now, \"Look, see! Trees, grass, peas\u2014\"\n\n\"STOP IT.\"\n\nI'm bending over the table, arms wide trying to herd all of the blue and yellow paint\u2014now spread out all over it\u2014into the center to make as much green as possible.",
        "Ester stood with her back against the wall of the Gatehouse, separated from her peers.  They buzzed with excitement, their anxiety lifting with each person who returned from The Gate, a unique animal companion in tow. Bears, rats, birds, even an octopus\u2014each pairing seemed to bring instant joy.  But Ester couldn't share their enthusiasm. The upcoming gifting ceremony filled her with a turbulent mix of dread and anticipation, threatening to erupt into either rage or tears.  Her parents' cryptic advice\u2014\"Expect the unexpected, but be ready for some pain\"\u2014offered little comfort.  Every companion that emerged from The Gate's swirling starlight was a creature she'd seen a thousand times before, save for the surprising octopus.  The familiar animals only intensified her apprehension about the unknown link, the promised pain.\n\nSuddenly, the Gatekeeper's voice cut through her thoughts. \"Ester Fermord.\" He gestured her forward.  Aware of the stares from her peers, Ester brushed her bushy red hair from her face and walked with determined steps toward the corridor housing The Gate.\n\nShe stood before the swirling starlight, fists clenched, feet trembling. Then, a roar unlike anything heard before shook the Gatehouse. The Gatekeeper screamed, a terror quickly mirrored by the others.  Through the swirling light, a gigantic, scaled foot\u2014green and dark red, with claws the size of Ester's forearms\u2014emerged. It resembled a monstrous hand.  Then came the head: horns spiraling up a long neck, a snout emitting white smoke, and a mouth filled with teeth like kitchen knives. Burning reptilian eyes fixed on Ester.\n\nA sharp pain, like a tuning fork, resonated through her body. Through the agony, a voice like an erupting volcano declared, \"Ester Fermord, I am Ignite, your companion.\"",

Then would come that peculiar expression\u2014lips pursed, eyebrows raised in what might have been mockery. How could such an enigmatic being exist out here in the cosmos?\n\nThe prophets had foretold of a trial I must face\u2014surely this was it. Of course! A guardian stood between me and my destiny.\n\nFortunately, I had come prepared. Ancient texts spoke of the guardians' curious affinity for office supplies. With this knowledge, I had brought one of our finest treasures as an offering.\n\nReaching into my photon storage bay, I carefully arranged the atoms to forge an item of legend: the Swingline stapler.

        "A klaxon shrills throughout the cold metal of my enclosure. I awake, startled, and try to make my conscious brain aware of my surroundings. Where am I? I look around and take in my location. I was sitting on a metal cot, my feet on the floor and my back against the wall, fast asleep.\n\nThere are shoes on my feet\u2014thick, massive boots. I am wearing a white shirt and orange pants. The floor is a metallic grate that screeches and squawks under my thick boots. The wall in front of me and to my left is a flat white. I reach out to touch it. It is cold. Behind me, the wall bears a similar story. White matte covering cold steel. My only mental salvation lies to my right. The wall mimics the others, but with one crucial difference: a tall door rises up from the center of the floor. There is no window, nor do I see a way to open it.\n\nA second klaxon blares through my habitat, jerking me from my thoughts. What is happening? I stand up and attempt to step toward the door. The boots are heavy. So heavy. My foot lands, and I try to pick up my other one. It stays on the ground, immobile. I lose my balance and begin to fall. In an effort to correct myself, I try to slide my other foot underneath me. It too is now locked to the floor, and I lose my footing. I land hard on my left shoulder, filling it with a sharp pain. It feels familiar, as if it's happened before a thousand times.\n\nSuddenly, I hear a voice erupt seemingly from nowhere, filling my tiny cabin with a sense of control. \"Prisoner 127! Move back to your cot\u2014now.\" Who is this? Who is prisoner 127? Is it me? This feels familiar, but wrong... in an inexplicable way. The order is repeated, this time the tone more strict and severe. \"I... can't!\" I reply, helplessly. My feet can't move. \"I will not tell you again,\" the voice demands.\n\nI try to regain my stature. To my surprise, the boots now move as I slide my feet under me. I pick myself up and sit back on my cot, as the voice requests. With a sharp, metallic sound, my boots once again adhere themselves to the floor. I am stuck. The door opens to my right. I manage to inhale a quick breath of air before three men in dark, unmarked, protective gear and helmets enter the room and grab ahold of me. I want to shout, \"What the hell are you doing!?\" But the wind is knocked from my lungs by one of the assailant's helmets crushing into my chest, pushing my chin toward the ceiling. With my head locked into place by a helmet and my feet magnetically sealed to the ground, the remaining men grab an arm each. The man in front of me grabs my head and pushes it between my legs, locking it into place under the weight of his body. From there, my arms are twisted behind my back and locked together. I hear the sound of zip-ties clicking together and feel their tightness on my wrists. The sound is familiar.\n\nThe two men on my flanks lift me up while the third exits the room. With a quick hand gesture, I feel the floor release my shoes from its metallic grip. He comes back into the room and places a bag over my head. I am escorted from the room.\n\nThe boots are heavy. I count my steps, though I don't know why. Clomp. \"1,\" Clomp. \"2,\" Clomp. \"3.\" I count to 47 before I hear a door open in front of me.",

The speaker, who appeared to be a human scientist, was, in fact, anything but. Thraxxich, hailing from the planet Erethrain, was a master of disguises. He wouldn't have earned the title of Collector of the Year otherwise. Humanity, the \"species du jour\" for his people, was a recent discovery for him, but, having encountered 341 alien species, they weren\u2019t difficult to figure out.\n\nThe matron, still processing the proposal, asked, \"So, you come in, do a quick test, and pay me 1,000 dollars?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.

        "\"Here's the thing, my boy is challenged,\" the man said.  I stared out the window at the blue sky, letting my mind wander. I knew this man was going to pay me, so I indulged in a bit of daydreaming, trying to find shapes in the clouds.  *Oh look, that one looks like Ronald McDonald.*\n\n\"Challenged?\" I asked, finally focusing my attention. *Who is this kid exactly? What am I getting myself into?*\n\n\"Imagination challenged. Got it?\" he explained. \"That's why you're here. I'm giving you money to watch my kid, play with him, pretend to be his imaginary friend. You're an actor. You can drizzle just a bit of play into him. I'm counting on you to make it happen.\"\n\n\"Got it, boss,\" I replied, my gaze lingering on his unusual nose before shifting to the hallway behind him.\n\n\"He's right inside his bedroom, just there. Go in. As soon as you come out with fun unlocked in my boy's hands, I'll give you the money.\"\n\nI opened the boy's wooden door slowly. It creaked, and I instinctively backed away before sliding it open.\n\nThe room was grey and tidy, with no child's artwork on the walls. It felt empty and wrong. My first instinct was to turn and run, to *get out*, but I couldn't. I needed the cash.\n\nHe sat there, small and crumpled like a paper ball on the ground, desperately needing someone to brighten his day.",
        "Here's the polished version:\n\n---\n\nIt aligned with uncanny perfection: the prophecy of the Al'tiine, the blind sage who spoke only in riddles and entrusted me with the secret to sealing the portal, and my rare gift as one of the seven who could hear the Night Shadows' whispers. Somehow, I found myself positioned to halt their invasion from the ninth dimension.\n\nThrough blood, suffering, and countless battles, I pressed on toward the forgotten desert's heart before the gateway could fully manifest\u2014even as the Others had rendered the world mute. While some offered aid in the form of trinkets, perhaps to assuage their own conscience, none dared walk beside me. The dark path of Malgorga demanded I traverse it alone, my sanity hanging by a thread with each step.\n\nWhat drove me forward was an unwavering certainty: I was the chosen one, destined for greatness. This was my true purpose\u2014to become existence's singular savior. I envisioned a world united in celebration of my deeds, with monuments bearing my likeness and generations of children carrying my name. I would be revered as a near-deity for millennia to come.\n\nThese grand visions sustained me until the final confrontation, where I discovered the vulnerability in the unearthly, ashen grey behemoth guarding the portal. I recited the blind man's incantation with fevered determination, watching as the gateway gradually sealed itself. The collective hatred of the Night Shadows' Elders washed over me like acid rain, but I knew I had succeeded\u2014I had saved them all, and then...\n\nDarkness engulfed me. I plummeted through an endless void, my very identity threatening to unravel. As I grappled with this incomprehensible turn of events, a thunderous voice shattered the darkness: \"Game Over.\"\n\nGame? What game? I had saved everything\u2014how could this be happening?\n\nThe voice resonated again through the void: \"Insert More Tokens.\" The sharp clatter of falling metal pierced the darkness, and suddenly my descent ceased. I found myself standing in my home, exactly as it had been before the raid\u2014all evidence of destruction erased. A scream rose in my throat, but before it could escape, the memories of recent days dissolved like morning mist, leaving only confusion in their wake.\n\nDeep within, I still know I'm destined for something extraordinary, and someday I'll prove it.

His vestments were strewn across a chair and he had a drink in his hand. He sipped thoughtfully as he looked down across the bay where the fleet lay at anchor, the royal crest flapping in the breeze.\n\n\"Father?\" I ventured, quietly. He never was a particularly sociable man, and I hated interrupting him when he was in one of his moods. To my surprise I was met with a silence that stretched out between us instead of the usual bitter recriminations or cutting remarks.\n\n\"Yes, son?\" He asked after a while, not turning to look back at me. His shadow stretched across the floor, a silent affirmation of the presence of the man who held the lives of millions in his hands.\n\n\"Your brother is dead,\" he continued before I could speak. \"His party was ambushed on their way to the front. They delivered his head to me in a box.\"\n\n\"He...\" I stammered.\n\n\"Is dead, yes, please listen when I am speaking.\" My father sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. \"I apologize, I am... distraught.\"\n\nI must admit I was rather taken aback\u2014my father had never once apologized to me in the twenty or so odd years I had known him. As he turned to me I was suddenly struck by how old he seemed, an eternity of sorrows etched into the creases of his face.\n\n\"I have sat on this throne for thirty-one years, son. And what have I done in all that time? I ignored the teachings of my own father, believing that the might of our kingdom was unstoppable. When I think back to the days of my youth I feel such foolishness. There is always more to learn, son. Even after all this time.\"\n\n\"The son I groomed and taught all the ways of warfare and rule is dead. Killed in an instant by a lucky pack of scavengers. I have ignored you for too long, I fear. Perhaps I saw in you too much of myself. Your brother was very much like my father, you see. Cunning, ruthless, with a keen eye for strategy.\"\n\n\"But he was the heir, sir,\" I said, and through a haze of disbelief I remembered my brother's wife. \"His marriage has already been consummated, surely\u2014\"\n\n\"His wife bears no child,\" he interrupted immediately. \"And as the eldest living male descendent of my house, the throne falls to you. It will be a difficult road, my son, and we have so little time. Perhaps I will come to realize that you will be a greater ruler than even your brother might have been.\"\n\nI had never considered or even made pretensions to the throne; it had always been my brother's birthright. But standing in my father's quarters with the sea winds blowing in and the last sunset of summer sinking below the horizon, I could almost see myself there. \"I will endeavor to do my best, father.\"\n\n\"Here is your first lesson: be ever vigilant. Across the sea there are many that would come to our shores and kill our people for wealth and enrichment. To the north and east enemies press in, looting villages and killing as they go.\" He took a long draught and set his empty glass on the railing. \"They call us monsters, son. And you must be ready.\"\n\nKey improvements made:\n1. Combined related dialogue sections for better flow\n2. Restructured paragraphs to build tension more effectively\n3.",
        "When I had invaded his kingdom, it was nothing out of the ordinary (as far as invasions go). Kill the armies, mount a couple members of the Royal Family on spikes, exile the rest. This was all pretty standard fare for warfare. I hadn't expected this foolish son of the former king to invoke a forbidden ritual and infuse himself with demon's blood, just so he could singlehandedly eviscerate my last stronghold and claim my life.\n\nHe had been a good servant, and an even better mage. If he had been given a few more years, perhaps he could have amounted to something. Alas, there he lay. His once fair face mutilated and smashed by the raw strength of this supposed hero and his newfound power. He rose from the marble floor and sent the limp body flying toward me, missing left.\n\nHe looked up at me, blood dripping from his bruised knuckles. His eyes burned with something I had seen in those who served me with unquestioning devotion: pure rage. Already I could see his veins pulsing red, his eyes turning to midnight. The demonic ichor he had ingested was consuming him. I understood now why my soldiers had feared him and his armies so much, he was a man willing to do whatever it took to win.",
        "Cyrus sat by the fire with his eyes closed, appearing deep in thought. Athene observed him, curious about what could be occupying the fair-haired healer's mind.\n\n\"Is he still meditating?\" Grao asked as he settled beside Athene, holding two freshly killed rabbits.\n\n\"I think he might have dozed off,\" Athene replied, rolling his eyes and setting down the stick he had been using to tend to the fire.\n\nIt had been two months since the trio had joined forces, or more precisely, since Cyrus had joined them. Their current mission was to capture at least three Black Dragoons for a fiery-tempered blacksmith in town. Although Athene's relationship with Cyrus was neither friendly nor hostile, their shared fiery tempers hinted at a familial connection between Athene and the blacksmith.\n\n\"I can hear you,\" Cyrus interjected, opening one eye to glance at the young red-head.\n\nThe tension between Athene and the blacksmith was palpable, as evidenced by the slightest provocation setting Athene off and him storming away, leaving Grao to notice his departure belatedly, as was typical of the young thief.\n\nAnger quickly turned to panic as an arrow narrowly missed Athene's face, followed by three more arrows prompting him to flee. Unsure of his destination, Athene reached for his dagger, only to realize it was missing.\n\nRecalling he had left it by the fire, Athene swore under his breath, struggling to retrace his childish steps. Another arrow struck him in the shoulder, slowing him down just enough to glimpse a blade aimed at his head.\n\nClosing his eyes, he braced for impact but instead felt a force pushing him to the ground. As he looked up, he saw a familiar figure in white and blue attire with intense green eyes focused on the bandit before them.\n\nCyrus swiftly incapacitated the bandit by severing his hand with a steel wire, causing blood to gush from the wound. To Athene's astonishment, Cyrus then used the bandit's blood to inflict further harm.\n\nEmerging from the bushes, Grao subdued the remaining bandits. Athene, momentarily forgetting the arrow lodged in his shoulder, winced as Cyrus attempted to remove it. Witnessing a friend in pain stirred an unfamiliar emotion in Athene, evident in his subtle change of expression.",
        "A fleet of a hundred thousand ships, each capable of obliterating a city from orbit, emerged from a wormhole. At the center, their mothership loomed large.  \"We're coming out of the wormhole, General. No signs of any defences on the perimeter of the system,\" a voice reported.\n\n\"It's finally been a hundred years for the people of Earth,\" the great alien general addressed his command room, his long green tongue flicking in distaste.  \"Perhaps I gave them too little time. This won't be much of a challenge.\"\n\nThe fleet entered Earth's system, holding position before a field of asteroids, the anticipated location for Earth\u2019s defenses. Hours passed. Scouts returned with nothing. System-wide scans for technology, even cloaking systems, yielded no results. A chill ran down the general's spine.  Had the Earthlings developed technology capable of hiding from them? The thought sparked excitement; a challenge he couldn't resist. Perhaps he\u2019d overestimated humanity\u2019s potential.\n\n\"Move our most advanced scouts towards Earth's known flight path. Send three. Losses are acceptable.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, a live video feed flickered to life on the mothership\u2019s command screen. A scout strolled casually down a deserted city street. \"General, no one is here. We haven't seen an Earthling since we landed. Scout 45 reports the same. The buildings look abandoned for years.\"\n\n\"Not a single Earthling? No resistance? What's going on down there?\" the general demanded, his voice laced with frustration.\n\nThe scout paused, flipping through a small booklet. The cover displayed a large airship. The general's eyes fixed on the image, a mixture of satisfaction and puzzlement.  They'd attempted larger space-faring vessels, but none had been detected. \"I'm sorry, General,\" the scout continued, \"but based on the science team's findings, I'm afraid you're not going to get the fight you were hoping for.\"\n\nThe general turned a dark shade of purple. \"Blast it all\u2026 let me guess? Disease? Mass extinction?\"\n\n\"No, General.\" The scout turned the page. The general recognized a device eerily similar to their own wormhole generators.  \"We believe mass migration.\"",
        "## An Atlantic Exclusive: An Excerpt from *Falling Forward: The Memoirs of President Mike Paulatowski*\n\nLet's be honest, I had no business being elected president. You know it, I know it. Pundits call me the \"Social Media President\" or the \"first populist president of the 21st century,\" but I was just the first person upvoted to the Presidency.  How did this happen?  It started with a gag.\n\nI gave a profanity-laden address, megaphone in hand, to an eighth-grade assembly.  \"You motherfuckers need to vote for me, cause I will CLEAN - SHIT - UP!\"  The kids thought a grown man acting like a crazy person for class president was hilarious. They got the joke. The rest of you, clearly, did not.\n\nThe video went viral. Then came the follow-up videos. More hits.  Suddenly, I was famous. Everything was cool. Until Reddit got ahold of it.  User sexybeeffarts45 started a write-in campaign.  Foolishly, I ran with it.  Next thing I knew, I was being sworn in.\n\nPolitical professionals talk about the simplicity of \"cleaning shit up,\" or how I captured the zeitgeist.  They're full of shit. Americans were fed up with a broken political system and sent a clown to D.C.  Too bad we got rid of the electoral college \u2013 that might have prevented this.\n\nMy dad always said, \"Winners never quit, and quitters never win.\" He never mentioned getting *fired*.  And Lord knows, I tried.\n\nFirst, I used the Patriot Act II to declare war on Canada.  They're so nice, I figured nobody would actually fight them.  Wrong. Oil companies loved the idea. Nine days later, the war was over, oil prices plummeted, and the economy boomed.\n\nMy next attempt: a three-word State of the Union address. \"Fuck All Y'all.\"  My approval rating jumped 15 points.  \"Refreshing,\" they called it.\n\nNothing was working. I needed something truly horrifying.  The end of Social Security. Who could support that?  Initially, my approval ratings tanked.  But investment banks and insurance companies were ready with a slew of retirement products.  Money shifted from taxes to banks, the stock market soared. People were pissed, but their opinions don't matter much these days. The system runs itself.\n\nI gave up. I wasn't getting fired.  So, fuck it. I built a go-kart track on the South Lawn and held the inaugural White House Flip Cup Championship.  Members of Congress competed, and I\u2019d sign one bill of the winner\u2019s choosing.

        "The truck bucked on the dirt track, wrenching the steering wheel from my grip for a moment. I tightened my hold, headlights cutting through the darkness. A grim chuckle escaped me. Two fucking tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and this was what I was doing? Using skills honed for the \"greater good\" against lowlife street thugs who'd crossed the wrong people? \"Pays good,\" I muttered, flicking my cigarette out the window.  In the distance, a truck waited ominously in the field.\n\nI could hear the guy inside, muffled cries for help straining against the duct tape. \"It's no use, kid! Stop struggling. It'll be done soon,\" I yelled.\n\nThey always struggled. Survival instinct, fueled by terror, was a potent cocktail when someone realized their life might end. I flashed my headlights twice\u2014the signal\u2014and the other truck responded in kind. A precaution against some well-meaning hillbilly stumbling across the scene. The thought of a do-gooder interrupting this made me chuckle darkly.\n\nMy truck rolled to a stop. I hopped out, lit another Marlboro Red, and let the familiar burn settle my nerves.  It always had, and it always would.\n\n\"You ready?\" a voice called from the other truck.\n\n\"Hang on,\" I shouted back, taking a final drag. \"Just need to get my gun.\"\n\nInside the glove compartment was the usual: a specialized Glock with a suppressor. Whoever wanted this guy dead wanted it done quietly.  Didn't matter to me who ordered the hit. Never had, never would.\n\nThe kid in the trunk was skinny, shaking under a duffel bag, the stench of urine thick in the air. I hated when they pissed themselves. I hauled him out by the scruff of his neck. He barely struggled, paralyzed by fear.  Everyone had seen the movies. Everyone knew the score.\n\n\"Signal out here is fucking awful, right?\" the other thug said as I dumped the kid on the ground beside the unmarked grave.\n\nI checked my phone. No bars. \"Agreed,\" I grunted, cutting the conversation short. These things never lasted long.\n\n\"Take off the bag and the duct tape for the picture. I gotta take a quick piss,\" I told the thug. He nodded. I ducked behind the truck, eager to finish up and get back to town, maybe find a cheap hooker.\n\nWhen I returned, the bag and tape were gone. The kid was staring at the ground, his\u2026 oddly familiar brown hair\u2026 No, I was just tired. Time to get this over with.\n\n\"Look up to the camera,\" I ordered, pulling out my phone.\n\n\"Tommy\u2026 Tommy? What the fuck, Tommy? What are you doing?\"  It wasn't a kid. It was Jonathan. My stomach lurched. What the hell was he doing here?  Dizziness washed over me. How? Why him? He was innocent. He was my best friend. Harmless.\n\n\"You know this guy?\" the thug asked, puzzled.\n\nI couldn't speak for a moment.  \"Sure I know him. We go way back. I\u2026 I can't do this to him. I've known him since I was five. Get up, Johnny. We're leaving.\" I started toward him.\n\nA metallic click. The thug aimed the gun at me. \"You got fifty grand for this. The boss ain't gonna let this slide. You made an agreement. Now fulfill it, or do I have to do it for you?\" He gestured with the gun toward a bruised and bloodied Jonathan.",
        "I had read about them\u2026 the Otherlanders. What a captivating story it had been. A man lost between reality and technology, stalked by a short, rotund figure and an eerily tall, elegant, thin one.  I had mused over its creativity, how compelling the narrative was.\n\nYet, the story clung to me, a persistent thought lodged in the back of my mind. Watching.  I returned to my normal life, but a part of me remained alert, an awareness I didn't fully grasp until the second or third time I saw *them*. \"Oh hey, look at that fat little man and that tall, skinny man,\" I'd think, \"that reminds me of the Otherlanders.\" I was so naive.  It continued, this unsettling pattern. Everywhere I went, I noticed their embodiment\u2014in men, women, couples, even animals, but never in anyone I knew.  I only recognized the size relation, the stark contrast. I never saw them again after that initial glance, yet they would always return.  Walking hand-in-hand through a brewery, making a delivery in the field where I worked, sitting at the movies, riding bikes down the street, even as birds in windows or squirrels in trees. Always there. Always two. What did they want? This couldn't be coincidence anymore.\n\nWhat *was* the story about? I tried to find it again, but there was no trace, no similar tales online or in libraries. The mystery began to consume me. What had the man haunted by these figures wanted? Needed? Loved? What did he\u2026 fear?\n\nI resolved to speak to them. I had never tried before.  Standing in the middle of the field, I waited for the short, rotund figure and the tall, elegant one to invade my space, to observe, to follow. The wind rustled the cheatgrass and sagebrush around me.  I could hear the highway rumbling over the hillside behind me as I scanned the plains.\n\n\"Hello, Elat.\"\n\nThey stood before me. I saw no footprints in the sand to indicate their approach.  Fear gripped me, but I noted the tall, thin, regally boned man in a tight pinstripe suit beside a smaller man with a bowler hat and a portly mustache attempting, and failing, to hide his bulbous face.\n\n\"How\u2026 how do you know my name?\"\n\n\"Elat Das, this *is* your name?\"\n\n\"Why are you following me? Why were you following *him*? I know you are Otherlanders!\"\n\nThey turned their heads to each other, puzzled.\n\n\"Are we? We *have* been following you, yes.",

It would almost be a mercy to end them.\n\n---\n\nAt first, they came in small numbers. Legions of grey men armed with laser blasters, ripped straight from the pages of science fiction. Each legion attempted to capitalize on the chaos of our internecine conflicts, targeting one region at a time.  After the initial assaults, we began reinforcing war-torn areas. The grey men continued their attacks, but they were met with unexpected resistance.

        "His eyes snapped open, and he sat up with a jolt, an inexplicable instinct prompting him. He glanced around in confusion. He had no idea where he was. It looked like his room, yet it didn\u2019t. Gone were the bare white walls and the usual mess of gaming consoles, controllers, and tangled wires. Instead, a softer scene greeted him\u2014surprisingly familiar. The gentle rustling of leaves outside mingled with shafts of golden light filtering through the open blinds, casting a glow on the flowered wallpaper that adorned the walls. His childhood home, it had to be. The wallpaper was unique; his mother had painted it herself. Vague yet fond memories surfaced of watching her cheerfully paint each flower when he was just a child. Those were better times, before the non-fatal yet debilitating illnesses struck his parents and the subsequent financial struggles ensued.\n\nHe slowly stood up, feeling the plush carpet beneath his feet and wiggling his toes to savor its softness. After a quick glance around to appreciate the room's beauty, he approached the window, lifting the blinds to look outside. He shielded his eyes from the early morning sun, its golden glow spilling over the familiar suburban neighborhood. A part of him wanted to wake himself up, to ensure this was only a dream. Another part wanted to manipulate the dream, while yet another warned him of its vividness. But he dismissed these thoughts, overwhelmed by the serene beauty around him. He felt an unparalleled sense of inner peace and happiness.\n\nHe slipped on a pair of pajama pants and a large, soft shirt\u2014just how he liked them. The door opened smoothly, unlike the squeaky, stuck doors of their current house. For a moment, he wondered if the dream had gone silent. But as he stepped into the hallway, the soft thud of his feet on the carpet, warmed by the vents beneath, and the muted sounds of a Harry Potter movie reassured him. He bet it was the scene where Harry first entered Diagon Alley with Hagrid.",

        "The first law of Quantum Economics states that currency doesn't exist until it's observed.  This might seem paradoxical: how can money be observed if it doesn't exist until observed?  The answer lies in the quantum foam, where at any moment, the potential exists for funds to spontaneously generate.\n\n\"But sir,\" Jennifer interjected, \"if money can be generated spontaneously, why isn't it constantly appearing everywhere?\"\n\n\"An excellent question, Jennifer, leading us to the second law of Quantum Economics: currency is generated and lost in reverse proportion to your awareness of it. This explains why a constantly monitored bank account dwindles, yet money mysteriously appears in forgotten places like your couch.\"\n\nThis prompted another student to ask, \"So, if we ignored our bank accounts, could we have infinite money?\"\n\n\"At first glance, it seems plausible. However, could you truly refrain from checking, from wondering about your balance?  Almost everyone is aware of their financial status, except perhaps the super-rich, and they face their own unique challenges.\"\n\n\"What kind of problems, sir?\" a student inquired.\n\n\"Quantum Tax,\" I replied. \"Remember, matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The energy required to generate currency must originate somewhere.  Ever wonder why the wealthy often seem unhappy?\"\n\n\"Are you suggesting money is generated from happiness?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. Emotions fuel our interactions with the world. Consider how little apathy achieves.  The potential energy of an emotionally rich life is transmuted into the currency we use daily.  Sadly, this conversion process always involves energy loss.  Attempts to replace lost emotions with currency inevitably fail.\"\n\n\"So, money is a useless drain on us?\"\n\n\"A drain, certainly. But not necessarily useless.  Money can achieve much good: feeding the hungry, housing the homeless, healing the injured. Compared to these, what good is happiness? It can't be traded, counted, or used to build mansions or travel to the moon.  Used properly, money is a powerful tool for equalizing happiness globally.",

        "The scene was unlike anything I had ever witnessed. The wind tore branches from trees and shingles from rooftops, scattering them noisily onto the street like a child in the throes of a tantrum. That's when the Laytons' house caught fire.\n\nPoor Layton had purchased it only a year ago, unaware of what had happened to the previous tenant, thanks to the agent's omission. What a disaster.\n\nTo his credit, Layton was always urging the Davies to keep their trees trimmed, but Andrew Davies was not one to take action. By the time the fire department arrived, the entire south side of the street was engulfed in flames, including my own house. Smoke hung in thick clouds above my bed. When I looked out the window, I saw red and gold shadows flickering everywhere.\n\nI must have still been groggy because I don't remember how I ended up downstairs.\n\nA crowd had gathered in front of the Davies' house. Andrew emerged, carrying his daughter, her head limp over his sweaty arms. I moved to help him, but the firefighters were shouting for everyone to stay back.\n\nAt the edge of the crowd, a man was laughing. His ears were dirty, his brow smudged with grime\u2014it was difficult to find a clean spot on him. I didn't recognize him, but I had no trouble shooting him a stern look.\n\nOur eyes met, and his grin faded. I turned back to the burning houses, listening to the crackle of the flames. A wave of almost *comforting* heat washed over me. For a brief moment, I considered stepping closer to the fire until another firefighter emerged\u2014\n\nFrom *my* house.\n\nHe carried a woman over his shoulder, running and coughing up smoke like a chimney. She wasn't breathing much at all.\n\nA suppressed giggle came from the man. \n\n\"What is *wrong* with you?\" I whispered, \"Can't you see how serious this is?\"\n\n\"I can see just fine, thank you!\" he replied cheerfully. \"But can *you*?\"\n\n\"What on *Earth* are you talking about?\" I asked, trying to meet his gaze with a hard stare. His face was an eerie purple and blue in the firelight. At least, I assumed the firelight was responsible for the colors. I couldn't quite place him, but I was *certain* I had seen him before.\n\nHe smiled, and with my brow furrowed, I asked, \"Have we met?\"\n\n\"Yes, we have. And unfortunately, we are meeting again.\"\n\n*Well, that's just rude,* I thought. I gave him a proper harumph and turned away.\n\nHe didn't take the hint. He pointed over my shoulder at the firefighter carrying the woman from my house. \"Don't you know that woman?\"\n\nHis voice had a teasing lilt, and I could hear laughter creeping back into it.\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"It must be one of the neighbors. The Lanes, maybe...\" I paused. The Lanes didn't have a daughter that old. \"Or... the Stevens...\"\n\nA strangled sound escaped from the dirt-covered man behind me. I turned to see him nearly *exploding* with laughter.\n\nFor the second time that night, I asked, \"What is *wrong* with you?",

At The Disco \n\nMarilyn sat in the corner of the room, nestled in a red paisley armchair, painting her fingernails a deep burgundy that flirted with black. Each stroke of the brush was purposeful and intense, the glossy handle gleaming in the dim light that reflected off her teeth. Watching from the bed, Morgan couldn't quite fathom why she was smiling. Glancing around, he counted three empty bottles of gin and a couple more half-full ones.\n\n\"What have I gotten myself into?\" he pondered.\n\n\"Shall we go?\" Marilyn's voice interrupted his dark thoughts from the corner. \"I'm ready to go.\"\n\n\"Let's go, then,\" he replied.\n\nThey traveled in a sleek black car to the ball. Morgan presented the forged invitation, feeling his tie constrict like a serpent around his neck until the bouncer nodded and welcomed him as \"Mr. Strumford, enjoy the evening.\"\n\nAs soon as they mingled with the crowd, Marilyn detached herself from his arm and vanished. \"I'm going to powder my nose,\" she had said. Ha. Marilyn seldom wore makeup, and when she did, it was only lipstick and eyeshadow. Nonetheless, she outshone every woman in the room. If they were diamonds, she was the moon\u2014rarer and more precious than all of them combined.\n\nMorgan drifted towards a group of partygoers, holding champagne flutes in their flawless hands and engaging in light banter.

Looking to build an empire.\"\n\n\"What kind of empire?\" Gianiss probed.\n\n\"Something I'm not prepared to discuss in good company,\" Morgan replied.\n\n\"Well, look at this big shot. What do you say, gentlemen? Shall we introduce ourselves to Mr...?\" The weight of the question hung in the air. If Morgan used his usual aliases, there was a risk of exposure. What had Marilyn suggested?\n\n\"Stanford, no relations.\"\n\nThey welcomed him. Finding a table, they delved into business discussions while discreetly eyeing the elegant women passing by, pretending not to notice a group of emerging mobsters and businessmen.\n\n\"Are any of those women yours?\" Morgan asked Gianiss.\n\n\"I assume you have your own arrangements, Stanford.\"\n\n\"For men of simpler tastes, certainly. But you employ women for clientele like us, don't you?\"\n\nGianiss chuckled. \"No one comes to sin city seeking a virtuous life, but I had hoped you might be an exception.\"\n\n\"There's no harm in indulging in what you've paid for.\"\n\nGianiss signaled, and three women approached the table.\n\nMorgan kissed the hand of a woman with auburn hair and green eyes. \"What's on your agenda tonight, Miss?\"\n\nShe smiled, a bit too widely, and whispered in his ear. Blushing, Morgan excused himself from the table. \"I think it's time for me to leave, gentlemen. Pleasure meeting you.\"\n\nShe led him upstairs, away from the ongoing party below. Morgan's absence went unnoticed.\n\nOpening a door on the third floor, she pushed him inside. Under the room's solitary lamp sat Marilyn, still grinning like a jackal. \"Sit, talk, give me a sign.\"\n\n\"I've got it.",
        "Here's my polished version of the poem, enhancing its flow while preserving its powerful narrative about literacy, class divide, and hope:\n\n```markdown\nThrough murky waters he waded with his stick,\nWhere trade's remains lay scattered, dense and thick.\n\nAmid torn cloth and cast-off leather skins,\nThese cast-aside luxuries spoke of others' wins.\n\nUnknown to those above, he dwelt below,\nA creature of the depths, reaping what they'd throw.\n\nWhen footsteps of the wealthy crossed his realm,\nHe'd tip his hat to those who held the helm.\n\nHe caught their cultured words with hungry ears,\nAnd dreamed of skies turned blue despite his fears.\n\nHe longed to speak with grace and read with ease,\nTo see his ailing wife restored to health and peace.\n\nEach dawn brought fresh discards raining down,\nWhile rising stench and grime threatened to drown.\n\nBut this day, as morning split the sky,\nA heavy thud made hope within him fly.\n\nHis stick struck treasure in the morning light\u2014\nA book whose printed page brought pure delight.\n\nHe struggled with the words, yet formed each sound,\nLike precious gems discovered underground.\n\nEach word painted pictures in his mind,\nEach sentence set a scene of rarer kind,\nEach page unveiled a world so vast and true,\nAs stories bloomed and understanding grew.\n\nNeglecting now his task of hiding waste,\nThe sewer man, though gaunt, found words to taste.\n\nFor when the wealthy tossed their books away,\nThey cast down bridges to a brighter day.",
        "I woke up on a bright Sunday morning. The sun was high up and life just seemed good. My cup of Joe was hot. The radio was playing my favorite tunes. I was ready to take on the day. I've worked for the NYPD for 15 years now and have solved countless crimes. From muggings in alleys to drunk barhoppers peeing on statues- I am the first detective mentioned when a crime happens. They say that if you've been forgiven for all your sins, when you die, you go to Heaven. Once there, you talk to the man upstairs aka God. Well, what if God came down to you? \n\nWhen I got into work, my task was handwritten and laid on my desk. The note read: \"Multiple religious scholars around the world have visions and dreams that God has left his post in Heaven to roam the Earth alongside humanity, making his temporary home in New York City. Track down the Almighty one and expose Him.\" What was strange was that the note was not addressed to me or anyone, as our tasks usually are; it was only signed in illegible handwriting. \n\nI left the office and walked to the first place I expected to find God\u2014church. I walked into the chapel and saw rows and rows of ordinary people, bowing their heads and praying. But there was no God, at least not in physical form. I left the church and walked down the street. Maybe God was in an alleyway, feeding stray cats, or helping to cure an alcoholic. \n\nNothing. I kept searching. I tried to pick up on supernatural hints that the Lord was upon us. Nothing. I decided to test my luck in the most unholy place I could think of. Maybe God decided He needed to pay a visit. I walked down the sidewalk and down a flight of stairs. I was in the New York Subway Station. I purchased a ticket and walked to the boarding platform. It was dark in the tunnels, and the people around me were as hopeless as they had always been. It seemed like there was no holy touch here. \n\n........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................",
        "Humanity, an unremarkable species by galactic standards, lacked physical prowess, possessed average intelligence, and offered no unique talents or traits of value to others. Initially, when the Hoto made first contact with humans, doubts arose about the worth of establishing formal relations. Consequently, only the Hoto engaged with humans regularly, feeling a sense of responsibility as the ones who revealed humanity's place in the galaxy.\n\nUnexpectedly, this seemingly benign alliance between the Hoto and humans would have a profound impact on the galaxy. Conflict arose when a rare tililium deposit was discovered on a Hoto colony near the Xig alliance, leading to a fierce battle for control. Despite the Hotos seeking aid from the Allied Planets, the loss of a single colony was deemed preferable to war. Only humanity responded to the call for help, demonstrating loyalty to their friends despite their limited military strength.\n\nThe subsequent war with the Xigs proved devastating, with the Xigs overpowering the Hotos and eventually targeting Earth. Although initially overlooked, Earth emerged as the last bastion of resistance, accepting Hotian refugees and fortifying its defenses. Humanity's tenacity and rapid acquisition of knowledge surprised all, enabling them to develop advanced technologies and field a formidable armada against the Xig invaders.\n\nThe defeat of the Xig fleet at Earth marked the turning point, leading to the liberation of Hoton and the restoration of lost territories. Human determination and unyielding pursuit of victory extended beyond the war's end, as they continued to advance and dismantle the Xig alliance. The unconditional surrender of the Xigs and dissolution of their military highlighted humanity's resolve and capability.\n\nPost-conflict, concerns arose among the Allied Planets about humanity's newfound power and potential aggression. However, humanity's return to Earth without incident and their acceptance of a place on the governing council demonstrated their desire for peace and collaboration. Despite their fearsome reputation in battle, humans proved to be a fundamentally peaceful race, advocating for unity and mercy in the aftermath of victory.\n\nUltimately, the galactic community recognized humanity's capacity for both conflict and compassion, embracing them as a strong ally while cautioning against provoking their formidable resolve. The phrase \"Never push the pink-skins to the thin ice,\" originating from the Hotos, became a universal lesson in respecting humanity's strength and resilience.",
        "\"You realize what this means, don't you?\" A shadowy figure spoke from its perch ten feet above Commander Uzyk. \"Humanity at large is losing hope. The outer walls of the Sanctum fell last month, and even the citadel cannot hope to survive long. And with this news -\"\n\n\"I acknowledge that the situation is dire,\" she replied, \"but -\"\n\n\"No. There is no other alternative. When the existence of life itself is threatened, those with the means to act must do so.\"\n\n\"Who said that? Hitler?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Sorry. I used to read the ancient histories.\" She shuddered as an explosion far away rocked the ground underneath her. Crates of food and weapons crashed to the ground, and the failing fluorescent lights flickered a few times more. \"Listen, the Council will never stand for your solution. And neither will I. We will fight to the death, but we won't sacrifice our principles.\"\n\nThe shapeless form laughed harshly. \"You think your moral stand will be remembered for all of time. But who will do the remembering?\" It leaped from the outcropping in the wall and stood next to her, still no more solid. \"I will do this with or without your approval. Do not get in my way.\"\n\nIt strode to a small door in the wall, and began pressing buttons on a keypad. As it did so, Uzyk scrabbled around on the floor, at last grasping a discarded bottle of some substance. She turned it over and read the date: 10/02/151441. \"It reads today,\" she spat. \"This is the last one. Our final hope. It's dead and gone. As are we all.\"\n\nThe darkness turned towards her for a moment, and it seemed to almost pity her, before pressing a final button. The door swung open, revealing --\n\nA storeroom packed with thousands of containers labeled \"Corn Syrup.\"\n\nUzyk gasped and fell to her knees. Shaking, she drew a gun from her belt and aimed it unsteadily at the blackness. \"You have doomed us all,\" she murmured. \"It is time to embrace the new way, Commander.",

It took me a while to understand that being handicapped is really just a state of mind, and that I could do anything most people could, too. Yet, the universe remained a cruel mistress, not content with giving me just one disadvantage. This past year, I lost both my father and my uncle, and their deaths haunted me most nights.\n\nThe voice on the other end was calming, sincere, and, surprisingly, full of guilt. \"Walter?

        "Dr. Gregor Kach wiped the sweat from his brow and stared out over the remains of the Old Library.

        "\"Freja's going to kill you,\" Heimdall's voice crackled over the comm. He'd been searching for hours, and Loki was nowhere to be found. \"Odin forbid, Loki. You know I don't have time for this nonsense. She needs that necklace!\"\n\nLoki's cackle echoed back, \"I know! She'll never get to Asgard on time!\"  The sound grated on Heimdall's nerves.\n\nHeimdall's ship boasted the best perception filters white light could offer, but Loki always found a way around everything.  He'd skirted the Baltic and was heading toward the open Atlantic when an idea struck.\n\n\"Damn it,\" he muttered, plunging the ship into the ocean.  If there was one thing Loki couldn't handle, it was aquatic frequencies. He brought up the outer shield menu and scrolled through the local fauna. \"No, no, hell no\u2026what's that? Seal. Perfect.\" He highlighted the grey seal icon, then slid the ship onto a submerged rock, setting the behavioral circuits to 'Lounge.'\n\nIf he was lucky, the excess water would disrupt Loki's sensors long enough\u2026\n\nA fly buzzed out across the water, stopping a thousand feet offshore. \"Clever little bastard,\" Heimdall sighed. He tended to exclude insects from the ship's filters\u2014too many to track. He began monitoring the airwaves, waiting\u2026\n\n\"Dumbass.\" Heimdall could practically hear the smirk in Loki's voice, his usual signoff.  And there was no sweeter sound than the abrupt silence when Heimdall hit the fly with a frequency jammer. The ship instantly reverted to its proper size, tossing its occupant around. \"Son of a\u2014\"\n\nHeimdall smiled, a deliciously vengeful smile, as he snapped the energy locks on the engines. \"Give it up, jackass. She needs the necklace, or the atmosphere will kill her.\"\n\nLoki, still slumped against a wall, pouted. \"Did I say you could come aboard?\"\n\n\"Cut the crap.\"\n\n\"You really think I would have let her die?\" A mask of mock horror spread across his face. He pulled the wrought gold and crystal necklace from an inside pocket and tossed it to Heimdall.\n\n\"I think you're enough of a jackass to try,\" Heimdall said, wrinkling his nose at the smaller god. \"How you became blood-kin to Odin, only the Fates know.\" He reboarded his ship, shoving Loki aside as he released the energy lock. \"One week banishment. No parole.\"\n\n\"A bit much, don't you think?\"\n\n\"YOU BLEW UP HER SHIP AND STOLE HER TRANSPORTER LOCK! NO, IT IS *NOT* TOO MUCH!\" Heimdall roared over the loudspeaker and the open channel.

        "I am alone, but I am happy. The wall kept changing. She showed up more than once. Change. It kept changing. Why couldn't it stay on her? Why couldn't it stay off her? Anybody would be better than her. It changed off of her image yet again. It needs to stop changing so I can focus. Focus on what I came here to do. What did I come here to do? The wall was white. Was it always white? As if that simple thought was the most important command, the wall transformed into a glittering array of colors. I once again lost track of myself and floated into the abyss of comfort. I snapped awake when the wall disappeared. I fell through, not realizing I had been leaning on the wall. Had I always been leaning against the wall, or did I somehow move positions? If I didn't move, did somebody else move me? That is impossible.\n\nI turn to the wall beside me, and it changes to an image of her. Her long golden hair was parted just between her bright blue right eye.

Her image was gone; this was not an unpleasant change.\n\nFalling. I was still falling. Was there an end to this feeling? The shimmer in the air next to me grew. I looked down at my hands, and they were holding onto an invisible something. I stood up, still falling. I reached out, falling faster. I grabbed on to her hands, and then she was falling with me.

        "Here's a restructured version of the text that enhances the narrative flow and builds tension more effectively:\n\n---\n\n\"No, sah. Not here.\"\n\nFrowning, I glanced over at Attenib. I'd heard a wobble in the man's voice that I didn't recognize. He didn't sound quite like himself.\n\nAfter years alongside Attenib, I knew his moods well, recognized the minor twitches of the muscles beneath his nut-brown skin. I'd worked with him long enough to trust in his uncanny ability to know just where to dig. But now, today, he looked nervous, pale despite his leathery, tanned hide. And when he looked back at me, I saw a glint of unexpected emotion in his eyes.\n\nFear.\n\n\"Atten, everything okay?\" I asked in a lowered tone, taking a step closer to him. Damnable insects swooped down at my face, biting and stinging. I managed to smack one, and watched with vicious satisfaction as it slammed into a nearby tree trunk and then dropped, stunned, to the forest floor.\n\n\"Is this the wrong place to dig?\" I asked again. I stood near him, almost shoulder to shoulder despite the oppressive, humid heat of the jungle. I'd called a halt, so our porters huddled several steps behind, taking shelter in the shade of a large palm.\n\nAgain, Attenib shook his head. \"Right place,\" he said softly. \"But wrong feeling. Not good to dig here.\"\n\nI took a moment to weigh his words. I truly believed that Attenib appreciated our arrangement, that he harbored no resentment towards my ownership of him. After all, I'd treated him far better than his fellows, snapped up on the bidding block to work the fields until their muscles and bodies failed them. But I'd seen his talent, and he'd served me well.\n\nBut we sat on our laurels too long, as I basked in the attention of the Royal Society and failed to note the new naturalists nipping at my heels. I'd secured the funding for this expedition, but one of the Senior Fellows had drawn me aside and warned me that, without results, it would be my last.\n\nI looked again at Attenib. Did he know the conflict in my head? He just looked back, waiting.\n\nI made my decision.\n\n\"Men! Gather your tools!\" I shouted to the hired porters. \"You lot! Axes, to clear the area! You others, picks and shovels! This is the spot!\"\n\nAttenib said nothing, but I saw him shrink back towards the camp. I should have disciplined him, I knew, but I chose to let him go. I had a dig to supervise.\n\nAnd soon, Attenib's almost supernatural talent proved itself once again, as one of the porters let out a cry of surprise. \"Sah! Over here!\"\n\nI hurried over to the man, roughly pushing him aside before he could damage the delicate artifact. But my words died away as I stared, open mouthed, at the object.\n\nSilver metal, curved, suggesting a large cylinder. Rivets in regular lines showed where the plates were anchored together. A hatch, the glass obscured with dust and dirt. And a logo of some sort, a square of blue with white dots, next to red and white stripes. It looked like a flag, albeit one I'd never seen before.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, utterly confused.\n\nFrom nearby, Attenib let out another soft moan. \"Evil,\" he answered me. \"Not from this place. It doesn't belong.\"\n\nI bent closer, wiping away more dirt. I saw words, now, stamped on the metal. \"Apollo,\" I read. \"What could that be?\"\n\nWith other objects, Attenib felt their history. That drew him to those hidden beneath the earth, feeling for their long histories, disrupted but to be resumed once unearthed. It became almost beyond notice, the history of all around him, all he touched.\n\nBut this object had no history at all.\n\nUnnoticed, Attenib shrank back, in amid the trees that reminded him of his childhood when he'd laughed and run between their trunks. His master continued to puzzle over the alien thing that he'd felt in the ground, but Attenib could stand here no longer.\n\nAnd as his master found the handle, reached for it, Attenib turned and fled into the trees. He ran blindly, not to anywhere, but just to get *away*.\n\n---\n\n*Note: this was written on my phone while my SO tries on clothes, so please forgive any spelling/autocorrect errors!",

It was only 2 p.m., far too early for whatever this guy was trying to sell. \"Sorry, I'm not interested.\"\n\nA hoof wedged forward, preventing the door from closing, and a red hand with large claws pushed it open.

Janice stood there awkwardly, realizing that no barrier remained between her and the intruder.\n\nWith a small, frustrated noise, she let the doorknob drop into the dust and strode into the kitchen. \"Whatever. You owe me for that door. It was... at least $3,000. Yeah, that sounds right.\"\n\n\"What? That door was only $800 at most. Where did you get a number like that?\" He paused, then shook his head angrily. \"No, it doesn't matter. I'm here because you ruined Hell. It's like Christmas down there.\"\n\nJanice stomped back into the room, holding a bottle of whiskey. \"You don't say. How did little old mortal me manage that?\" She took a swig before pouring a glass. She glanced back at the creature. \"You're not getting any.\"\n\n\"I don't care. I followed the clues\u2014\"\n\n\"Ah, a good old-fashioned Nancy Drew...\"\n\n\"AND I believe you're behind Hell freezing over.\"\n\nJanice rolled her eyes, gesturing impatiently in his direction. \"How do you know Hell froze over?

        "Fifty years is a long time\u2014enough to go mad and find sanity again.\n\nI remember before it all happened, the CDC jokingly claimed they would have a cure \"within a week\" (http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm), despite their 32-year struggle to cure HIV, their 2,385-year knowledge of herpes without a true cure, and the flu remaining a threat until there were too few humans left to contract it. To their credit, the scientists worked tirelessly until their last coherent thought was drowned by their craving for brains.\n\nA year before the outbreak, I underwent a \"stem cell\" treatment that helped repair nerve damage from a childhood surgery to correct a malformation. Back then, it seemed like the eradication of disease and disfigurement was just around the corner, with technology and biology joining forces to save humanity. Ironically, I suspect that my resistance to the zombie infection and their indifference toward me is somehow linked to that stem cell treatment.\n\nThe outbreak spread rapidly, initially resembling an HIV-like infection transmitted through bites or contact with zombie bodily fluids. The virus eventually formed a symbiotic relationship with a bacterial group and a mold, expanding its transmission methods. Only those aboard the ISS remained safe, though they faced the grim fate of starving while witnessing the world's demise.\n\nBy the time the infection reached us, there was no time for panic. Mold infiltrated buildings, wood, and areas with standing water. Its spread was blamed on water trapped in sinks and toilets, connected to the sewage system. The transition from infection to becoming a zombie took about six hours, often beginning with flu-like symptoms. Some people simply fell asleep, never to awaken with human thoughts again.\n\nOne often-overlooked aspect of zombies in movies is thermodynamics. Zombies don't consume each other, and most animals can either escape or are immune. This means zombies must ingest material to remain active, expending energy to stay \"alive.\" Once their digestive systems deteriorate, they survive only about 32 hours, quickly exhausting their ATP reserves and becoming too stiff to move. Anyone wise enough to remain hidden could survive. The actual \"zombie apocalypse\" lasted about three years.\n\nIn the second year, I had a mental breakdown, convincing myself I was a zombie and joining a horde. We chased wildlife and consumed the remains of survivors who had starved. The sight of a decomposing family jolted me back to reality, and I quietly slipped away, leaving the horde to their grim activities.\n\nThat was 48 years ago. With eternal youth and a city full of books and movies, I've taught myself nearly everything. I wasn't going to die anytime soon; by year four, I had established a garden and traps. Learning to make and do everything became easy.\n\nOne of my projects was setting up a \"mesh network,\" reprogramming WiFi routers to create a city-wide network for monitoring and automation. I scavenged solar panels from highway signage, daisy-chaining them to power the local radio station. I linked the station's computer to my network, allowing me to avoid returning there. Heat-sensitive cameras covered every city entrance, and radios tuned into my station were scattered throughout, like turning on a TV when home alone, but on a city-wide scale.\n\nFor a year, I collected every solar panel I could find, from large ones on city structures to those in pocket calculators. I also scavenged canned food, WiFi routers, medication, security cameras, wiring, movies, books, video games, hard drives, portable PCs, IDs, photos, phones\u2014anything that preserved the voices and images of others.\n\nI gathered electric cars, using solar power to charge them. Wrecked and damaged cars provided parts, while those in good condition were stored indoors for future use. A Camry Hybr",
        "Here's a restructured version with improved flow and coherence:\n\nTitan pursed his lips as the Hadron collider powered down. \"Hmm,\" he mused. \"That's all?\" \n\nHe looked down at the trembling \"scientists\" that came only to his waist. Their fleshy exterior and poorly-constructed internal skeletons disgusted him. Their meager attempts at fusion and fission had barely scratched the surface of their potential, even after a few thousand years of discovering how to harness the power of fire.\n\nDr. Ashe stammered and muttered some reply, but Titan merely scribbled on his clipboard, turned on his heel, and walked away. \"Looks like low 800,000s, if you're lucky,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Anything less than 850,000 gets selected for harvesting!\" He chuckled to himself. That would get them quaking.\n\nThe sea of meatbags parted before him as he wove through the crowd of onlookers who'd gathered to take his picture. His sleek armored legs shook the ground beneath their feet, causing their eyes to widen in fear. Honestly, he was rather disgusted with the squabbles and petty rivalries this world had to offer. They didn't even have holographic photo-3D mapping, for Ublar's sake!\n\nHe nearly fell over, however, when a small human child, no more than 7 years old by his estimation, didn't move out of his way. He looked down angrily, prepared to berate the small boy, but refrained as the boy pulled something from the crinkled blue bag and offered it to Titan.\n\n*Hmph*, he scoffed. No mere gifts or trinkets would sway his decision. He was a professional, and there was nothing, *nothing* that had thus far distinguished the people of this planet in *any* way whatsoev-.....\n\nTitan's eyes widened as the cookie was placed in his hand."
