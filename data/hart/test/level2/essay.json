GM\r\n\r\nhas created driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in some danger.\r\n\r\nSensors are'nt new , in the 1980's automarkers used speedsenors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. It's alot os sensors around but just in some places you can't find them or even reconized them until you put your hands on it , then it would either go off or beep but you would kno if its a sensor or not.",
        "A vast majority of people who have seen \"The Face on Mars\" belive that it was created by aliens.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be true because there is too much evidence to disprove this conspiracy theory.\r\n\r\nThe Face on Mars was not created by aliens because it, in fact, does not even resemble a face, and there are many others like it on Mars.\r\n\r\nThere is too little evidence supporting that it was created by aliens, but there is pleanty of evidence that supports the fact that it is just another rock formation on Mars.\r\n\r\nOne example of this evidence is that The Face doesn't look like a face at all.\r\n\r\nIn the passage \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" is states that the picture taken in 2001 of the eleged face \"actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 2001 image taken by MSG (Mars Global Surveyor) you can clearly see the large rock formation that is present on Mars surface.\r\n\r\nIt very clearly shows that it is not a face created by ancient aliens.\r\n\r\nSome strong belivers in the theory that think it was created by aliens state that NASA is covering up the truth and not telling the public the truth about the Face.\r\n\r\nThis however just would not make any sense.",
        "The author should continue studying Venus despite the dangers it presents. because in the text it talks about how they had to stop studying Venus since the spacecraft would not survive more than a few hours.\r\n\r\nWhat they know about Venus is how thick its atomosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide, and its challenging are the clouds of sulfuric acid. The planets surface the average surface is 90 times much more then on earth. And it has the hottest temperature in the solar system even if Mercury is the cloest its not as hot as Venus.\r\n\r\nSince no spacecraft survived the landing more than a few hours. They would stop because it wouldn't survive. It explains why they haven't got a spacecraft to stay at Venus. And what I would have to guess on why they didn't survive is probadly because how intense Venus really is. Now by intense I mean how strong the planet really is. Now more then 3 decades Venus has not had a spacecraft there. They haven't gave up. But they're trying to find a way.\r\n\r\nNASA is working on other ways to study Venus.",
        "Although many people think that the \"Face on Mars\" was created by aliens, I believe that it's just a landform. Before spotting this landform, NASA had no further information on alien's on Mars. Also, the camera that the team used was at its' maximum resolution, meaning that they wouldn't miss a thing. Lastly, the team could enlarge the picture three times bigger, so they could see things located on the ground.\r\n\r\nBefore the team at NASA spotted the \"Face on Mars\" they hadn't heard anything about there being a possibility of aliens on Mars. Therefore, I think It's highly doubtful that this could happen.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first look that the team took was a little hazy, they went back with a higher quality camera, which they set at the maximum resolution. With this camera it would be very unlikely for them to missunderstand an alien creation as a landform.\r\n\r\nLastly, on top of having a high quality camera, the team could enlarge the picture up to three times bigger. This helped them so much that it allowed them to see things as close as the ground. After this, it was positive they couldn't miss a thing.\r\n\r\nConsidering that before the NASA team spotted the \"Face on Mars\" there was no further evidence of aliens living on Mars.",
        "The author suports the idea because in the text he says that Venus is kind of earths twin cause its the same size. The author also wants to do that because he says that although Venus is a dangerous panet that it could still be studied.He puts in there that even though Venus is the second-closet planet to the sun that it has many different features than Mercury. Considering the fact that Mercury is the closet planet to the Sun, but it has different qualities than Venus. The Earth is different from Venus because Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees.",
        "Driverless cars would be a positive advancement in our modern society because they'll be safe, cheap, and helpful for people.\r\n\r\nThese high-tech cars, once fully developed, could be much safer than current buses or taxis. Driverless cars would be completly covered in sensors, as stated in chapter 4, \"Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.\" using Google's mostly-driverless car as an example. These sensors provide a, \"constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.\" which could be programmed to be much more aware than human eyes. Sensors have been around for a while, and could provide lots of safety once fully developed.\r\n\r\nThe driverless cars would also be cheaper and more earth-friendly in the long run. In chapter 1, it says, \"The car he (Sergey Brin) foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis...\" which is a big statement. In North America gas prices are constantly fluctuating but are generally considered to be quite high. These cars, using half the gas of current taxis, will be a good deal versus current gas prices. If these cars do become the majority of transportation, some people will also stop buying their own cars, which is a huge investment. Plus, using less gas will lead to a healthier enviornment. Driverless cars will eliminate the hefty gas-usage and large money investments.",
        "I dont think that the technology that shows peoples emotions should be for everyone.I think it should just be for scients to see more into human emotions and to see how it effects us. Letting anyone to have the ability to see emotions just from one simple picture could be harmful at times.\r\n\r\nFor example, someone could be very happy then a second later something sad popped into there head like their animal died and it makes them slightly sad, and then they send a picture to their friend and they might think that something really bad happened\r\n\r\nbut in reality nothing really did, but they keep on bugging them about it and it makes them get to get into a fight and ruins a friendship.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that it wont be helpful but it could ruin something.There are different ways to see this, some people could see how it will help others, some see that its a threat or invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\nBut i think that it shouldnt come out yet because it could harm someone if it gets out of hand.",
        "Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in. Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school. To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one. The use of reading a students emotions is valuable in many ways like helping with possible depression, enhancing the material, and creating a better enviroment.\r\n\r\nSchool can be a stressful time for many students and also a time of growth. Especially in high school and even middle school, the childs body is going through puberty. This chemical change in the body can lead to mood swings and other issues especially when school stress is added on top. This technology is capable of indicating \"...the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\"(paragraph 7). With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion.\r\n\r\nAlso, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases. However with the aid of this technology \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" (paragraph 6). If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well. For difficult classes being able to know when the students are lost would help significantly in increasing the understanding of the material as teachers will be able to know exactly what the students dont understand, and thus be able to help them achieve better grades.\r\n\r\nBeing able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall.",

Also you can hold table tennise tournaments and many other things in the holds. Lastly you can make new friends with the other seagoing cowboy that are on the boat with you.

        "I think I would go with the idea of developing cars that are driverless because of how it functions, what it uses, and why we use it. How it works is that its just a normal car, but it drives all by itself. I think thats a good thing because if lets say if a family has a huge celebration and they forgot something at the store. Well, we can let the car go get the things that they need without leaving the house to miss anything. So, the car uses a huge amount of battery power and goes get the things from the store. The car also uses no fuel or half of the fuel that we use today.\r\n\r\nThese cars thats going to be built in the future is going to save alot of money and it will not effect our ecosystem and not waste anything. What it uses is mainly under alot of wires but mainly runs to a big battery that charges all night and runs all day without having to stop at gas stations and refuel everytime. Plus, the car has to use a gps sensor to find out its surroundings of the car like in paragraph 4. It states that it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Which is a smart idea because, if there is something nearby and it sensor it and warn the driver.\r\n\r\nThe final thing that I want to talk about the driverless cars is why we use it. Back then, they made a special track that only a smart car can drive on and they wanted to put magnets in the road so, the car can track the positive and the negative so the car will not get into a crash.",
        "The author suggests that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus has her terrible conditions. He gives several examples. One of the examples is that, on Venus there is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets it. To even make it harder. The clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acidbin the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe second example is that scientists are still talking abot making a vist there when they know the surface is to dangerous. There are astronomers that are real amazed at Venus because they belive the Venus was once almost like Earth a really long time ago. Venus long ago was probably covered with oceans and could have had various life forms like Earth. Venus till this day has a rocky surface, valleys, mountains and craters like Earth. The value of retuning to Venus seems indisputable.\r\n\r\nThe last example is that NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Imagain a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the surface of Venus. It would sit 30 miles above the surface For it being that hogh it would avoid the conditions of Venus but it would still be hot. It would be about 170 degress Farhrenheit, but the air pressure would colse to sea level.",
        "Is there such thing that a computer can define our emotions? How can a computer software define our emotions? Now in days, the technology is getting bigger as the years pass by people start to know even how to make a car drive by themselves that is one of the things we do not hear everyday. The computer sowftware that can define our emotionsis now that people use in work or even at school use.\r\n\r\nImagine the world with the computer software that can read our emotions that will be very amazing. For instance, you can probably not tell the emotions on somebody face when you see them they may be smiling right at you, but what if they are feeling another way you may never know what they are actually feeling that is why i think the computer software is a good idea to read people emotions. As the time goes by people are getting tired of showing the same feeling they might already started to think that they are not getting no where with what they are feeling. Of course, that everybody know how to describe what happy and sad looks like, but what if they are not feeling none of does emotions what if they are actually nervous or scared and there is no way that you can help them. The computer software stores alots of energy different kind of specific emotions that people can use to tell other people's emotions.",

Driving on your own may be more safe than trusting technolgy to get you somewhere .Driving one of the driverless cars sounds like you can rest or just sit back and watch where you are going but what if you get in a crash and you didnt do anything the car did that might take alot of money out of your pockets for something you didnt even do.",
        "Using this type of technology of emotional expressions will be very useful for teacher and parents to help their students or children to see if something or someone is making them feel happy, angry, disgusted, or feared. Having this technology in schools will also help parents because the parents don't have to buy a computer that can try to handle this type of technology.\r\n\r\nIf teachers do a test on students that are getting bulied or getting picked on, this type of technology will help teacher get students to speak up and or find the person that is bullys other students. By showing the student that's getting pick on a picture of students the teacher thinks who maybe the person bulling the student, the student may make a fear face on the picture of the person that is picking on the student.\r\n\r\nIf teachers see that a student is failing their classes and don't talk a lot in school, the teachers can make a test on that student to see if they are going through things back at home. Teachers can have the students parents to come to the school while the student is being tested, they can have a converation on what makes the student angry or depressed about.\r\n\r\nThose are some example why I think this type of technology can really help teachers and parents learn about their students or children that they don't want to speak of.",
        "How scared would you be if you looked to your right and you saw no one at the steering wheel of the car next to you? Well many car companies are working on driverless cars for the public. This technology although imperfect at the moment has been around for years. It stated in a article that, \"Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009.\" However, driverless cars are dangerous and should be banned because they are not completely driverless, legal issues if there was a car crash, and the technology is still too insufficent to be trusted.\r\n\r\nFirst, the \"driverless\" cars are not completely driverless. For example in an article it stated, \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" With this information we can see that \"driverless\" cars are still not completely driverless. This can make it dangerous if the driver is not paying attention, when attention is needed. This could be fatal if the driver failed to get to the steering wheel in time.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the legal issues that would be created by this new form of car would be catastrofical numbers of laww suits. The question of who would be responsible is a difficult one. In the text it stated, \"...if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" This question does raise a lot of legal issues. Many states in fact have already banned this car. It stated in the text, \" As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars, California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Coloumbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autononomous cars...\" As you see many states have banned these self driving machines, obiously for good resons, because of all the law suits, legal issues, and because they are dangerous.\r\n\r\nFinally, The technology is still too insufficent to be trusted with the lives of innocent people.",
        "Whether you are someone who believes conspiracy theories, or are just plain stupid and think that somehow the Face is evidence of alien life, you are still wrong. It's just a rock, a plain, thousands of years old, heap of rock. The End, no \"Ifs, ands, or buts\", there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa, a landform, we have picture proof of it. However, considering that I must write this for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, I still have to argue about it pointlessly with an imaginary person who might or might not exist. So, I will cover two major points to prove to you that it's a landform, common sense, and the facts that we here at NASA have proven to be true.\r\n\r\nFirst off, this argument is over whether Face was created by aliens, or whether it is just a natural landform. This is a pretty strange argumental topic, as people who believe this stuff anyway will hardly be convinced by a random scientist at NASA. Anyway, there is proof we have that face is just a natural landform, we have taken multiple pictues of it, and have concluded that, as shown with this cite of evidence, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the America West.\" We can even say that it was not obscured by any clouds or haze because it was clear day on Mars the day the picture was taken. That should be the end of the discussion, but yet you say, \"But Mister science man, what if the pictures that you took couldn't see it because it was too small?\" Well, that point can actually be rebuted as well, because of what Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixer size,\" he added. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\".",

Driverless would have to use sensors aournd the whole\r\n\r\ncar for the car to drive propely. Google has modified a Toyota Prius by putting senseors aournd the car. Google's car had driven miles without crashing. There will be times when a person will have to take over and drive the driverless car beacause the driverless car can't navigate through construction site, drive ways, and heavt traffic.\r\n\r\nGoogle and GM have made systems to alert the driver in the car to take over and drive the car. States will have to make new law for driverless cars. People have their doubts about driverless car like what would happen if the alewrt system doesn't work or crashs from the driverless car will cause problem. Then people will not know who to blame the driver or the manufacturer? Automakers will continue their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.

        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" i chosed to be on the maunufacturers side becuase the sensor is a good and safe idea for us people that drive. they can ster, accelerate,and break by themselves. There are some sensor that have a vibration in the seat it tells you when your vehicle is in danger backing into a danger.\r\n\r\nobject . Also using heads up displays when your driving like some thing are not available like trying to text and call someone on the phone.\r\n\r\nThe driverless car is a great idea beacuse the car tells you when you should break. Reason why this is a good ideas it can steer for you what if it really slippery out and you have no controll the sensor will help you keep calm of the car. The sensor tell you when you should go fast and slow down. this may reduce the amount of car crashes.\r\n\r\nThe senor that vibrate when you are driving is a well thought process because is your driving of the rode your seat will virbate telling you your off the road. also it tells you when you need to get back in your lane when you are driving. this will reduce car crashes because it helps indacte where you are driving.",

The way the rocks were fromed they made it look like a face when it really was not. The shadows from the planet also played a part in the story. It gave an illusion that the eyes, nose, and mouth peolpe just wanted to make a big deal of nothing.\r\n\r\nThe way the people tried to make it bigger than what it is that makes people more hype and they are going to think that it life on Mars. There is nothing on Mars like an other life froms. It was just a crazy story that somebody made up to get people to panic or take intrest in nothing. All they did was make free addvirstivement for NASA thats really all they did.They was all over the place they was in magazines, books, Hollywood films and haunted grocery store checkout.\r\n\r\nSome of the scientist wanted it to be a alien artifact but they knew it was not.

In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is a near by planet, and it has much intel that we need to understand. Is the data, and research we could get from this mysterious planet worth the risk? The research we can get from Venus is well worth the risk it may take to retrieve the data needed.\r\n\r\nWe have never been to this planet before in person, but we have had unmanned ships come to Venus but with the outstanding temperatures of 800 or more degrees Fehrenhiet, and the thick atmosphere they only last on the planet a near only few hours.

        "Venus is our closest planet to us besides Mars (sometimes) but does that mean that we should start to think about the possiblities of us landing there? The author of the article \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" is suggesting that we should go forward and try to study and hopefully go to Venus despite the dangers that are capable of happening. Venus may be our \"twin planet\", but it is very different from Earth. I think the author of this article supports this idea very much.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple reasons on why I think the author supports this article. One is because he talks about how Venus could have been. Venus is the most Earth-like planet that we know in our solar system but they don't exactly know if it once was like us or not. Astronomers think that Venus was once covered with oceans and it could even have supported forms of life. The author also talks about the features of Venus today. The author points out that the plant has some siliar features as us like valleys, mountains, and craters. The author ends the paragraph ,where he talks about this, with this sentence, \"The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making a mission both safe and scientifically productive.\" This makes me think that the author is trying to get us informed about the options that it could take to make this Venus situation be safer.\r\n\r\nThis information we know about the planet is very different than ours. One of the details that the author points out is that it has a thick atmosphere of amost 97% carbon dioxide. Another thing he says is that the clouds are made up of sufuric acid and that the tempature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "Although some might argue and have a different opinin, facial recognition is extreamly valuable in the class room. It can tell if a student is confused with the subject.

Computers in the schooling system is not an uncommon thing and it is used as a tool to teach students. The FACS program will be extreamly valuable to students. Every student learns at their own pace, where one student understands it right away another student might have difficulties with the subject that they are learning. With FACS this is no longer an issue, the computer system can read based off of facial expression if the student is understanding the subject or if they're having troubles. With this information the computer system can modify the teaching method or go back over parts that it belives the student is having troubles with. This goes along with if the student is slowly starting to get sidetracked and bored with the computer as most children do.",

Although the idea of a diverless car hasn't been fully develope, they predicted that it will be by the year 2020. In the my perspective I think the idea of a diverless car is bad because of the many problem it could cause.\r\n\r\nA diveless car is not exactly \"diverless\". In the ariticles it said, \" The car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel...human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over.\" This tells us that a diver still need to keep hold the of wheel and stay alert. The human still have to be on the look out and take over when their is a problem.\r\n\r\nA diverless car is not safe because it can bring technology problems and failuar. It said in the articles,\"New laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the diver or the manufacturer?\" This tell us that even if the diverless car is developed their will still be flaws. As it was mention in the article if someone got injured who would be at fault? If the person got injured they would blame it on the company and their would be problems.",
        "In the atricle \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, He tells us that new facial emotion technology is being developed. Technology like this would be valuable in the classroom because technology like this would tell us what a person's emotional expression. Technology like this can stop bad things that are caused by hate and sadness, like suicide.\r\n\r\nThe technology will create a 3-D computer model of the face being scanned. It will can the 44 major muscles in the human face. Muscles such as the frontalis pars lateralis muscle convays the emotion of being surprised, by raising the eyebrows. The human will convey many emotions at once, so by using video imagery, the software will be able to track the facial movements. The units created by the facial expressions will be compared to a face that show no emotions. But, humans can do the same emotions calculations on a regular basis by looking at a friend that is sad or mad, but it'd be difficult to explain the facial features being conveyed at certain time. A classroom computer will be able to scan a childs face and see if the student\r\n\r\nis bored or\r\n\r\nconfused, then the computer would act like a human instructor and modify the lessons to make it easier or less-boring to the student.",

The car will have a sensor the sensor has become advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. they also can cause the car to apply breaks on individule weelsand reduce power from the engine,allowing far better response and control than a human driver could mange alone. To make things more safe you are to be alert at all times its like going for a drive and relaxing but you know if you ever feel unsafe you can take over.\r\n\r\nThe cars are developing so fast not only google is making one as other car companys such as mercedes benz, audi, and nissan are putting in effort to make one by 2020. Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passagers, and pedestrians safe, and law enforcement know that the best way to get that is with an alert driver. the nlaw questions how they are going to get around the car such as if an axident happens. Who is reliable the driver or the maurfacture? even if traffic laws change new laws will need to be made in order to work with the cars. I belive if the car will make everyone more safe then it is worth it.\r\n\r\nIn the new cars drivers need to be aware as if anything goes wrond with the drive they are there to take over. why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver? Wouldent it get boring waiting for your turn to drive? i dont think so if it makes the roads safer then noting should be to much of a hassel.",
        "Students Expressions\r\n\r\nEveryday people are coming up with new technology to help the students learn in class. They give them computers and let them use phones and calculators. But the new software that can identify students emtions is going to help in so many diffent ways. The Facial Action Coding System will not only help the student but also help the teacher. If a student is feeling a certain emotion and doesn't want to participate in class that day then the teacher can help them due to their emotion. One other reason FACS could help, is with all the school shootings that are happening you could detect that a student was mad or sad because of a bully and help them before they do something disasterous. Another reason FACS could help is to stop a bully. If the software can dectect happiness it can detect hatred and it would be helpful in many schools if they could stop a bully before the bully found a victim. These are the some of the many reasons why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in school.\r\n\r\nIn many classrooms students hardly ever show up to school ready to work and learn. With the FACS teachers could use it to help those students and make sure they do their work so they student can suceed. Then on the other hand if a student is ready to work and very energetic the teacher can help them learn at their pace. Most students would agree and say that learning is hard if its not at your own pace. With FACS the teachers can learn what the students pace is and teach them accordingly.\r\n\r\nSchool shootings are becoming a regular thing in America and most of America feels the way I do; they need to stop. Students have emotions that lead them to committing acts of terror like this and the FACS would be able to detect if a student was sad or mad because of a bully. All the teacher or adult would have to do is talk to them and it could be avoided. The most effective way to stop a disaster of that magnitude is stop it before it happens. With the Facial Action Coding System it could easily be stopped.\r\n\r\nBullies are everywhere in schools: classroom, hallways, cafeteria, bathrooms, etc.",
        "Luke want others to participate in the program ''Seagoing Cowboys'' because when his firend told him to join the program, Luke knew that it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Based off the acticle I read, it says ,''Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China''. According to the text, Luke helped other people, and he wanted them to join in case they want to do the same thing. For example, Luke had turned 18 before arriving in Greece, like he could be drafted the the military service. he wanted people to join the program because they can experience adventures and visit many unique places. Luke also did not only help people but, caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy. Luke said,'' I'm grateful for the opportunity .'' The author stated, ''And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.''\r\n\r\nIt also says,\"It was1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).''

        "I believe that the face of Mars is just a natural landform because there is no such thing as aliens living upon us. Another reason is that Mars could've got hit by an astroid that came from the Astroid Belt, or maybe could've had a volcanic eruption. I know this because in the passage from the article it said, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing.... a natural land form.\"\r\n\r\nAnother passage form the article says, \"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.\" I believe that Mars had signs of life, and water in the passed, but now Mars has changed and is still changing over time. Mars does not have water anymore, but theories show thats there might some signs of living on Mars.",

And when we help them, a great feeling runs through our whole body and it is a feeling that you can never get anywhere else. When you join, you have the oppourtunity to see new and different places than you are use to. We got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. We also saw the Acropolis in Greece; took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy; toured an excevated castle in Crete; and saw the Panama Canal on our way to China.\r\n\r\nThe Seagoing Cowboys can have some fun after their work is done. On returning trips, after the animals had been unloaded frem their holds, the holds were used for games like baseball and volleyball. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.\r\n\r\nThe seagoing cowboys is a great oppurtunity for a lot of things. You help those in need, can see places you havent seen before, and play games with your friends.",
        "Driverless cars will be a great innovation in the automobile insustry, because driverless cars will be safer, more convenient, and possibly more fuel efficient.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars would make the world a lot safer, when dealing with automobiles. People die everyday in car accidents. With driverless cars, at first, of course, there will be complications regarding the sensing and accident prevention. After so long, with yearly upgrades and constant innovation, driverless cars' software should excel to the point of perfection, without any accident occurance. In paragraph 5, the test states, \"Sensors are nothing new, of course. in the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.\" This example shows that sensoring software ability is increasing, and as time goes by technologists learn more and more. Over time sensors will get better and better to the point where driverless cars are 100% safe.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are more convenient than cars with drivers. Cars with drivers require full attention from the driver. There are many cases, involving possibly injury, or even just fatigue, where a driver is forced into a position of either finding alternate transportation, or driving under dangerous circumstances. If a driver owns a driverless car, or has the accessability to a driverless \"taxi\", then whether fatigue, injured, or intoxicated, the driver, or now passenger, can safely be transported to their destination, without the result of an accident.",
        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author describes where the cars are now and how they are effecting society.\r\n\r\nEven, after reading the passage, I don't believe that driverless cars should be a reality right now.\r\n\r\nMaybe in a few years, when changes are made for safety precautions, but in the now, we can handle driving on our own.\r\n\r\nHaving the \"smart roads\" equipped with electrical cable or magnets, as General Motors and Berkeley engineers did in paragraph 3, would never work with rebuilding all new roads all over the world just for these cars.\r\n\r\nImagine the time and money spent just for these roads to be built.\r\n\r\nAnd what will happen once the passengers are on a road without these \"smart\" adaptions?\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the next version of this driverless car is to rather equip the car with sensors and not the road itself as the Toyata Prius did in paragraph 4.\r\n\r\nBut no matter how many sensors, lasers, or recievers you have on this driverless car, artificial intelligence will never be as smart as human intelligence.\r\n\r\nWhat will happen when a deer jumps out from a field, a pedestrian rides his bike, a child's ball bounces out from her yard, or a pothole comes near comes bouncing from her yard? Will the sensors and lasers notice the change and react as fast a human would?\r\n\r\nEven if there is still a driver in the seat, as said in paragraph 8, what will keep their attention on the road and not fixated on their phone or other passengers?\r\n\r\nNo amount of buzzing or flashing lights will get the attention of the driver to whatever accident may occur quick enough to make a change.\r\n\r\nIf anything, the displays will make the driver panic in such a way that will make their safety decline further.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are especially targeted to keep those who would normally drive while under the influence of alchohol and others safe from them.\r\n\r\nBut once again, what if something should come between the car and where the car wants to go?",
        "I know that people are saying that this is proof that aliens inhabit Mars, but trust me, this is not proof. I wish this was proof. It's exactly what we need to hear right now. It's exactly what we've been needing to hear for years. We wan't to find evidence of life on Mars, so why would be hide any signs from you?\r\n\r\nIf you still don't belive me, look closer at it. Some images the face is more clear than others. That means that the eyes and nose that you see are just shadows. Aliens wouldn't make an artifact that only looks like a face from certain angles. They would want it to stand out.\r\n\r\nSome of you say that the alien markings are hidden behind the wispy clouds. Well, we checked again at a time when it was clear and you could see everything fine. There were no alien markings. Like I said, if there were we would have been extatic. The whole world would have known about it within a few days.\r\n\r\nI know it has become a huge pop icon, and I'm sorry yo ruin this for you, but it has to be done. It's just a landform.

        "Wow, from the mar really look like humans face. It have eyes,nose, and mouth. It weird that on mar there is nothing and it shape like that is really weird. Most people think there is alien who live there do. They say it maybe it for living thing for alien. I think it just a natural land form because there is no alien monument.\r\n\r\nFirst, The face of the mar really is popular for other. It even appear on hollywood film, books,magazines, and radio. Maybe it just not close enough to see if it flat or it like mountian. It show a lot of stuff going on on mar. Mar is really history for people in may 24,2001.\r\n\r\nNext, I think it just natural land form because on the shadow it look like pyramid. If you look at the shadow and you can see it not it have to much pointing on the top. The eyes waht they call it might be the whole for some water. the mouth can be just a crack on it.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we can go look closer scientist NASA might catural n tell.

        "I think it would be cool to have a driverless car. I would say that even in a driverless car, the driver should still be able to take control when needed. I think we should keep it to where the driver could take control whenever, because of road construction. I would say that a driverless car, with also control of a driver would be fine.\r\n\r\nI would say it's fine because, Google has drove driverless cars under specific conditions since 2009. They have driven more than hald a million miles without a crash. I think they are saying it is safe. Also, the Google cars aren't actually driverless because, they are alerted when to do something. These alerts are for example, when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, as in roadwork or accidents.\r\n\r\nI think it would be cool to have one when you need to answer an emergency call. It will be safe to answer the call, because if you need to take control it will alert you. If someone was injured, I would say it would be the manufacturers fault. I would say it's the manufacturers fault, because they are the ones who made it, they were in control of making the car the whole time.\r\n\r\nI would say a driverless car would be safe, in only some conditions. These conditions would be, when the car alerts the driver when they need to step in and drive.",

        "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" the author gives many good reasons as to why driverless cars are the next big thing. Driverless cars will have driver alert features to them but the question is will they function correctly and not fail us causing an even bigger mitsake? According to cofounder Sergey Brin drdiverless cars are the next big thing for the future. It is no longer flying cars it is now driverless cars. Brin is a believer that a driverless car will fundamently change the world. As exciting and wonderful a driverless car sounds its is not a good idea. Technology brings many new wonders and fasinations, but the technology that will be used for a driverless car will eventually fail the driver.\r\n\r\nA driverless car seems very intresting and many good ideas and opinions are being published to the public but will the true story about driverless cars ever make it through to the public? No because the manufactuer will always find something good to say about the car whenever the public says something negative. A driverless car will be another mistake to our generation of new ideas. The author of the article said in paragraph 7, \" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. \" Then later it also stated, \" This means the human driver must remain alert. \" The human driver needs to remain alert at all times because we will never know when the driverless car will need human assistance. Leading to the fact the already the car hasnt been made but they already know that the car will need human skills at times. Already the cars technology cannot be trusted. As the human driver you will get distracted or may fall asleep. You may not even know the car is going to need assistance at times and before you know it your at risk for a crash the driverless car haas caused. Drivers will also rely to much on their car because they will thik it is so up to date on technology that it wont fail the driver. The human driver may go out to a party one night and get drunk. The human driver won't care because the car will take them back home safe and sound as they were told. Will it really though? Along the way the technology may stop working and before you know it the drunk driver will be behind the wheel not only putting himself in danger but everybody else on the road.\r\n\r\nSome other issues with the car may also occur. For example the driver alert functions may stop working out of nowhere. In the acrticle it stated, \" GM has devloped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in dnager. \" The vibrating chair may stop functioning correctly and the driver will not know. The driver may not also know how to properly use it and may put the car in a mode that isnt supposed to be in at the moment. Who still reads the instructions? That is a very low number and many people just jump straight into using the object.",
        "When you join the Seagoing Cowboys, you join a year of adventure. When you join, you get to take care of animals like horses, cattle, and more.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,\" he says. So was taking a godola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.\" Imagine seeing beautiful cities that you always wanted to see, right in front of your eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, when you join, you get to have fun.

        "Why do I think that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens? I think that ,because on April 5, 1998 Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the Face on Mars ten times sharper than the orginal picture in 1976 by the Viking. My second reason why I don't believe that aliens created the Face on Mars, is becase on April 8, 2001 Malin's team took a picture of the Face on Mars. Not only is believing that the Face on Mars was created by aliens is illogical, but many pictures have been taken, there is still not a single sign of aliens.\r\n\r\nMy first reason why I don't think the aliens created the Face on Mars is because the MOC team snapped a photo of the Face on Mars ten times sharper, so you could see more clearly. You could see clearer than the orginal Viking photos. When the web surfers saw the picture, all they could see was a natural landform. Not any sign of aliens. My piont is that the clearer the pictue gets, the less it reveals that aliens created the Face on Mars.\r\n\r\nAccording to the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars'', \"Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'' Garvin told them. Compared to the 1976 photo taken by the Viking, the newer camera spans 1.56 meters for each pixel.",

And I know the all the supersticios people who think it's \"Alians\" would say that nothing that I'm saying proves anything but with the new camera that we had if there would have been any housing, which there would have had to be to construct such a monument, thene we would have seen it.\r\n\r\nNow that i have told my side of the story everyone can calm down.",

        "Is the use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System valuable to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom?. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'alto, the author describes how a new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promissing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a sudent is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it hepls the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them.\r\n\r\nSchool brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the techers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or thewy might be confused but afraid to speak up so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". It also states \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor\". By this evidence , the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored; this would allow them to think throught about changing a new method to teach so the studetns don't get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The mayority of students nowdays don't care about school or just don't get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don't bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success but they don't implement it, so what is best than a new tehnology to help out a little.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time.. Wouldn't it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles\". It also states \"The software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)\".",
        "In this article called,\"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" it explains an advanced technology that can identify what humans are feeling on the inside. This technology is attention grabbing and seems so futuristic. The Facial Action Coding System claims to have lots of uses. I think that this new technology could be very useful in a learning environment. The Facial Action Coding System could benefit a classroom setting by being able to tell if the student is completely understanding the material, being able to tell if a student if bored and zoning out, and by seeing if you are enjoying the lesson.\r\n\r\nA lot of times students do not understand the information that is being pushed on them and are too afraid to ask questions. Teachers can't read a students mind, and teachers aren't a computerized system to identify if a student is understanding the concepts in class. Students are often too afraid and embarrassed to ask questions in class and for that sake, they just don't do it. From personal experience as a student, this can be frustrating and doesn't benefit my education. The new Facial Action Coding System could change the way people learn on a whole new level by being able to identify confusion, and then breaking down the concepts more. Having a system that can identify if students are confused could be extremely beneficial on lots of different levels.",
        "I think that driveless cars are great because for example say if your on the road and your hands start to get tired you can relax and let your car do all the driving and driveless cars can also be good for people with arthoritist or people who have bad hands regardless of the causes.\r\n\r\nI think driveless cars are good because if your on the road and your hands start to get tired the car can do all of the work until you feel like driving again but you still have to be cautious and be aware of what your cars are doing. The car to me sounds great because in the story it quotes \" The combination of all this input is necessary for the driveless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. So basically if you have a driveless car and your not holding the wheel the car would still drive perfect do to it having the skill that make the car drive like a human is\r\n\r\nbehind the wheel. These cars also have problems you have to be ready and grab the wheel if your car lights blink indicating that you are about to hit someone or something.\r\n\r\nDriveless cars would also be good for people to have arthoritist because if the car drives it's self the person behind the wheel wouldn't really have to do anything only when the time comes. The story indicates that the people in the car entertainment are trying to make driveless cars fun because i know if someone just sitting in there cars doing nothing but listening to music they would get bored but i also know people with arthoritist would love these cars because they will not have to use there hands they could just sit back and listen to music. Driveless cars can be perfect for many people of all kinds and they can help in the society.\r\n\r\nDriveless cars can also be great for people that wants to have fun\r\n\r\nif they dont feel like driving.",
        "In my opinion the use of the Facial Action Coding System computer is valuable for reading emotions. Stated in paragraph 6, they show an example of when and how it works, so smiling at an ad that apppears on the screen another like it will appear, and frowning at that particular ad the next ad will be diffrent. Showing that these computers work at identifing emotions in diffrent ways is amazing. In paragraph 7 showing that the emotions used cant be identified on an regular home PC computer because the process is too complex, is also showing how the FACS computers is the real thing. How it calculates what emotions is shown in the painting of Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci by the specific percentages in paragraph 1 gives us a more stable idea of how it works, it doesn't just gives us the bland emotion of happy or sad, but gives all of the emotions that might've been happening with Mona Lisa while getting painted. This is why i believe the Facial Action Coding System computer is valuable for reading human emotions.",
        "\"Skrt!\" \"Boom!\" That could be you in a car accident. Car accidents are really high in america and thats terrible. Many people believe that driverless cars will help reduce accidents. They won't reduce accidents they will only increase it because technology fails alot, it wont have fast reactions, and drives wont see whats going on.\r\n\r\nTodays technology is great, but it fails alot. Once they perfect technolgy then maybe they could use a driverless car, meanwhile they shouldnt use it. I think its a great idea and descisons that some states wont allow or test driverless cars. They can hurt someone by technology turning off. What if someone hacks and goes and controls the car? People need to realize that its a bad idea.\r\n\r\nHow can a driverless car react? A human would have to be awake and see whats going on. If a car spuns out the car wont stop because it wont see it and its only focus is getting the human to the destination point. Humans rely on technology way too much. Its not safe, but it is usefull dont get me wrong.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing is that driver will trust the car and they will just sit back and relax. They wont see whats going on because they trust the driverless car. What if your running late and the car goes only its speed limit you wont make it to your job or the plave you need to be.",
        "The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is able to suggest and back up their claim of Venus being a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers by stating facts showing how science and technology will help us in the pursuit of exploring to Venus. They gets us concerned by stating the perrils of exploring venus. Then they state why the audience should be interested in exploring Venus, and proceeds to counter the perrils by stating technological advancements being made to lessen the extreme environment on Venus.\r\n\r\nThe author shows the perrils by first stating the dangers and compare them to intense atmospheres on Earth, such as how the ground temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and would instantly melt most metals. Another example that he gives would be when they states that the gravitational pull of Venus would crush a submarine that was meant to explore the deepest depths of the ocean at Earth. One more example of this would be when says that staying above it is still a danger because of how hot and unbearable it would be. Those are the situations that he has listed.\r\n\r\nAfter saying all the dangers of exploring Venus the author decides to mention why scientists are still attempting to explore the dangerous planet. An example would be that Venus is very much like Earth. In the article the author mentions Venus and Earth having many of the same features, such as mountains and valleys as well as evidence showing Venus possibly containing water and oceans. Another thing the author tells us is that the planets orbit at different times, so at times Earth may be closest to Venus, and other times we are closer to Mars. Those are all reasons why scientists wish to explore Venus further.\r\n\r\nThe author, after having told us the conditions and reasons to explore Mars goes further. The author then states technological advancements being made to help survive the conditions on Venus to obtain samples and such.",
        "Have you ever been in your car and thought I wish my car could drive by its self? Well you must have a fairy godmother because your wish just came true. They have started to design driverless cars now, they are very efficient. They are a lot easier to drive as well. Driverless cars make everyones life easier and they need to be manufactured.\r\n\r\nThese driverless cars can actually limit your risk of having an accident. The cars have a sensor and they sense when an object is too close. The author shows this by \"Those sensors had become moe advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers.\" This shows how these cars can better keep not just you but also your family safe. These cars also have auto brakes which can better prevent collisions. The author gives examples of this in \" Can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine.\" This shows how the car can prevent accidents from happening.\r\n\r\nOn top of that these driverless cars are a lot easier to handle or control. On way they are easier is by being able to navigate through work zones by itself. the author shows this in this excerpt \" They can steer...\" This shows that they can steer by themselves. Another way is by going around accidents. The author states that the veichle will be able to go around a proplem it faces.\r\n\r\nIf that's not enough to convince you its a good idea then they also make drivers more alert when they're on the road.",
        "Student emotions can sometimes be hard to read. Students experience many different emotions everday throughout school. Some students may be happy and excited about school while others are bored and drowsy. New technology has been developed called the Facial Action Coding System. This system enables computers to indentify human emotions. This technology would be very benefiticial to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.\r\n\r\nWith this new tech teachers would have the ability to read there students emotional expressions when they are giving a lesson. If the students emotional responses are boredom and drowsiness. Then the teacher will know they should change what they are doing so the students become more alert and interested.\"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. If a student is becoming lost or dosent understand the material the computer will recognize that and the teacher will be able to stop and help that student.\r\n\r\nThe use of this tech will allow teaching in the classroom to become more efficent and if a student is struggling teachers will be able to recognize that quicker.",
        "Have you ever actually wondered if aliens exist? i bet you have well,everyone has there own definition on a alien. But who really is to say they arent from here on out ill telll you why i think aliens created such a face.\r\n\r\nfirst there were alien markings. from what i know about aliens there very smart. if aliens are smart why not blame it on them. and even in paragraph 8 i qoute it sais \"alien markings were hidden by a haze\" why wouldnt an alien make a face if they have nearly as much intelligence then yes. id have to say the aliens mine as well have done it.\r\n\r\nsecond in the photo from 1998 the photo is very clear it is a face but in the photo from 2001 it is cracked and doesnt nearly look the same maybe a alien could have drew that or really anything not that i have evidence but im just saying if it looks like that. that looks like the creation of a non human. but who really knows.\r\n\r\nbut you also have to think this a is a nother planet so why wouldnt it be a aliens creation.\r\n\r\nso through all ive said what i mean is through a humans creation we are very intelligent, and if aliens are anything like us id say they would have a great chance of creating that. this is another planet so i mean if they did and they lived thier then i mean thats were they live thats there house thier art.",
        "Facial Action Coding at schools?\r\n\r\nClass rooms with , Facial Action Coding , ? I think for a classroom with Facial Action Coding would not be such a good idea in a classroom. There are many reasons why it's not a good idea. There are many emotions in a student in a class room that a student wouldn't want to be recogize . For many student there always someone who is in love and does not want anyone to figure it out . In paragrahp 3 it tells readers that \" happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness\" can all be shown with the Facial Action Coding System. The student might be sad because the girl wouldn't go out on a date with him and show that emotion in class.\r\n\r\nFor many students I honstley think alot of students would not like it . Another reason why it would not be a good idea to put this new Facial Action Coding System in many classroom is it might distract many of the students. Alot of classroom students are already going through alot of things like stressing, grades, finals, and credits. They wouldn't want that to be pick up by the system for a example a student could be really sad about his grades and doen't want anyone to know. Our minds are only safe place to go where anyone can't go.\r\n\r\nOther places would be a better option for the Facial Action Coding like hostiptals and nursing homes. A good reason why I think it would be a good idea at a hostpital because it can help alot of people that are sick and feeling pain. In paragraph 3 it say the system can pick up happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.",
        "The pursuit of the dangers includethings such as gravity,temperature,air pressure. The gravity because of in paragraph 5 the author made an example to a vehicle probably a space rover hovering above the surface. The text states that \"Just like jet airlplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms,a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions but staying up and out of there way\". Bascaily saying that the vehicle would have hard time to stay on the ground. The temperature would be as The text states in paragraph 5 \"around 170 degrees fahrenheit\". Temperatures would be scoiling hot. Air pressure would be another danger because you can only take so much pressure before you got to back to the surface. As the text states it once again in paragraph 5 \" would be close to sea level \". I do agree with the author as he says in the text \"Not easy conditions,but survivable for humans. There has been some movies about living on harsh conditions where astronauts had to live on planets with harsh conditions.",
        "I think the development of these cars would be a good idea,\r\n\r\nFirstly, the cars would use half of the fuel so\r\n\r\nIt would be better for the environment .Also, It would produce less pollution.People who care about the nature would buy these cars, helping the process to get rid of the pollution.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\r\n\r\nAlthough,none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless so It means that if we keep developing these technology we can reach the point of cars driving without a human being.Also, these cars remains alert to the human driver to be ready to take over when the situation requires, so people can manage the situation.\r\n\r\nThirdly,It's safer in all the aspects.Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.\r\n\r\nThe way that Driverless cars use the technology is increible, If the\r\n\r\nDriverless cars can do this now, who knows what they will do.",
        "Everyone shows emotion at some point in their lives. Whether it be joy, sorrow, or even anger everyone has expressed their emotions in one way or another. Now there is a computer software that can recognize six emotions. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom using this technology is valuable because it could tell the instructor when a student is confused, it could modify the lesson, and it could help people feel more empathy for each other.\r\n\r\nStudents can become confused very quickly when an instructor is teaching about something. This computer software could stop this from happening and overall help students have a better experience at school when trying to learn. In paragraph six Dr. Huang talks about how this could revolutionize a classroom, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" This would overall help a teacher know when someone is confused so they can help them after class or talk to them more in-depth about the lesson. This invention could hep out many of students that find lessons to be very hard and don't know how to do whatever the instructor is teaching. This software could also modify the lesson that an instructor is teaching so that it is easier for a student to grasp.\r\n\r\nMany teachers present day don't necessarily care if the students are learning what they are teaching, but just the fact that they are teaching it gives them a clear concious. This computer program could give the teachers an alert saying that someone isn't getting the lesson because they are confused with a certain topic that the teacher talked about during the class. They could then modify their lesson so that it is easier for everyone to learn.",
        "Can technology really sense emotion? Can your computer tell if you're happy or sad? These are some of the questions that Facial Action Coding System is attempting to answer. Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is vaulable. It can be used to keep students engaged, active and eager to learn. Adjusting a learning program to what a student finds appealing will help them have a positive connotation with learning.\r\n\r\nUsing programs like the Facial Action Coding System to read students emotional expressions is a very vaulable tool. It can help keep students engaged and active. In todays schools, it doesn't even come as a suprise when you hear that a student fell asleep in class. Students who are not engaged in a learning activity tend to fall asleep or do something that is non-productive. This causes them to miss out on a possibly important lesson. In paragraph six Dr. Huang notes \"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.\" Using a computer to detect when a student is becoming bored is a vaulable tool because it can change the lesson, prevent the student from loosing interest and missing out on a lesson. With a program able to identify when a student becomes bored or uninterested, more students will stay on task and become engaged in the lesson.\r\n\r\nIn modern schools, technology is being intergrated at an incresing rate. At Fishers High School every student is required to have a learning device such as a laptop or iPad. More classes are beginning to take teaching online. Without having a real instructor, students can easily become bored or distracted.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph six, Dr. Huang is quoted saying \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" Dr. Huang is referring to the Facial Action Coding System being able to detect student emotion to gear the lesson towards what is more appealing to them.",
        "Is it a natural formed face or is it made by aliens? I'm a scientist telling you that it is a natural form rock. There are a couple reasons on why it is not made my aliens. It will be provided in the next three paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe first reason is, that we here at NASA caught an image of a face in 1976 by viking 1. At first we thought it was an alien or a face made by aliens. Then in 2001 we found the same picture of the face, but got a better veiw and a better picture quialty of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the first one. Whe the imaged appeared on JPL web site, reavealing that is was a natural landform, not a face made by aliens.\r\n\r\nWe did some more tests to be sure that the landform was really a landform or if it was a face made by aliens. We figured out that is was a natural landform.\r\n\r\nThat is was not an alien monument after all. We tried to find it again but it was hard.\r\n\r\nThere are no such thing as an alien.",

This program can detect how you are felling and in what precentages. In the following paragraphs they will talk about if we should or should not read students faces to make the classroom experience more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWell to start off the technology has decoded the Mona Lisa smile.

The author explains the goods and the bads of going to Venus. It is a worthy pursuit because with studying and evaluating about Venus the U.S can make huge changes and make a new discoverys.\r\n\r\nVenus is a worthy pursuit because in paragraph 4 it explains how Venus is the most earth like planet that anyone has ever seen. In paragraph it also explains how long ago venus used to be covered with oceans and many various forms of life. Astronomers also say that venus to this day have features that analogou to those on earth. Despite the very cool things you can see in Venus it comes with a risk. NASA has come up with a possible solution. In paragraph 5 it explains how NASA is coming up with ideas to get closer to venus without any dangerous things that can happen.

        "Driveress cars have developed a lot in advancing to their purpose, but it doesnt actually replace the driver. Many cars have been developed and tested to see if driverless cars reduce the amount of accidents. Accidents will always be something that will have to be considered. I do not support driverless cars because there will be argumental faultry when it comes to an accident, drivers actually have to be more dependent on the car, and the price of the car would not be accessible at first.\r\n\r\nWho is really to blame for accidents that happen by driverless cars? Manufacturers certainly do not want to be blamed for something they did not do, but they did make the car. The driver does not want to be blamed for an accident that the \"driver\"less car did. If driverless cars are to actually happen, there will be a lot more lawsuits coming to the manufacturer becauase they did not actually follow through with the meaning of driverless cars. That is to be said that the manufacturer has to tell the buyer of the car all of the components that actually need to be taken into place to resist from getting into an accident. Therefore, if the driver actually has to do work to resist a \"driverless\" car from getting into an accident, then what is the point of buying a car that you will have to watch over and make sure no accidents actually occur?\r\n\r\nDrivers now are actually driving the cars, meaning they are in control. When the driver is in control, they only have to watch over thereselves andthe driving of others. Defensive driving has been the tactic for many years to resist accidents. What would it be for driverless cars? To resist any accident you actually need to make sure your car is doing the right thing.",

There are many dangers as well, but I belive the pros outweigh the cons in this situation.",
        "Control your life or let it control you. Since technology has improved significantly since the past decades, In the article \"Driveless Cars Are Coming\" humans are able to create vehicles that drive themselves. They have their pros and cons but the cons out-shape the pros. Driveless cars are lethal, illegal, and time consuming to manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe first reason on why driveless cars are lethal is that they are not tested fully and can injure the driver very severely if not handled right. This is evident in paragraph 9 where the author states, \"manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe.\" This is a perfect example of how the driveless cars are still unstable and should be tested. Overall, companies still need to improve on some aspects on the driveless car to have it be a safe to use.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that the utilization of driveless cars on testing is illegal. Evidence to support this claim is that the author states in paragraph 9, \"As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.\" This makes the invention difficult to find it's short comings and hard to sell. More evidence is found that alot of people can get in trouble due to this technology failing, which is found in paragraph nine again, \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" This can both harm them because of the injury and the company's reputation. Overall, driveless cars are suited to test because of the law.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last reasoning on while driveless cars are suited for the market is because of time.",
        "Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it has proved that it is a very challenging place to examine more closely,so because of this they find that sudying Venus is a worthy pursuit no matter how dangerous it could be.\r\n\r\nOne reason why Venus is a worthy pusuit because it is one of the most chalenging places to examine. In the article it said,\"While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vintage point of Earth,it is proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.\" this meant that even though we are able to see venus it is very challenging to examine closely.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why Venus is a worthy pursuit is because venus is the closest planet to earth which makes it easier to get there but the problem is Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to examine and study even though it is Very close to Earth. In the Article it said,\"Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challanging planet for humans to study despite its proximity to us.\" this means that even though Venus is very close to us it is still a very challenging planet to study.\r\n\r\nOne final reason why Venus is a worthy pursuit is because astrononers were fascinated by Venus because it may have been the most Earh-like planet in our solar system. It says,\" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\"",
        "Drivereless cars might be a big thing in the future, but are they really worth it? Could driverless cars actually be more dangerous than an individual driving a car themselves? I think it could be, think about it, a car driving itself, theres only a thousand things to wonder about the dangers it could have behind it.\r\n\r\nIn the article, the author states that driverless cars can \"steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notfiy the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through worl zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" Some individual drivers already don't pay attention while they're driving themselves, becuase they're too busy texting, talking on the phone, or messing with the radio. So what happens if the driverless car needs to get the human drivers attention, but they aren't paying attention to their surroundings? Anything could happen, the driver could get into an accident of its own, and could face possible dealth.\r\n\r\nCar accidents are a huge thing around the world right now, especially with teen drivers.

        "Cars today are driving closer and to being able to drive on their own. This can change the way people live and how people use tranportation in a positive way. Even though they aren't entirely \"driverless\" and still need a driver it's still a step in that direction. Driverless cars would take over public transportion system, create less accidents, and help people who can't drive well.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are esstientally going to be the future public transportation. The cars will end up taking the postions of taxis and even buses. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisons a future where these cars will offer much more flexiblity while cutting the useage of fuel by half.\r\n\r\nThese self drivng cars will also be safer for others on the road reducing the chances of a crash. Car companies have taken extreme precautions with these machines fitting them with senors all over the cars. Google has taken the idea into its own hands with some companies like Toyota. They've modified a Toyota Prius and have outfitted it with a postiton-estimating sensor on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted ner the review mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. These sensors will apply brakes and reduce power from the engine so that the driver at hand can take over.\r\n\r\nOf course these driverless cars will need a passenger that a operate the car in case of an emergancy. In 2013, BMW announced a development of the \"traffic Jam Assistant\", which allows the cars to handle driving functions at speed up to 25 mph.",
        "I dont agree with this idea of driverless cars becuase my first thought when I hear \"Driverless Cars\" is i woldnt be safe. Thats my concern; safty in the car. If the car doesnt require you to drive then something in the wires and sensors could malfunction.The car could sense something and break quickly and could cause accisents or cause the person in the vhecial to get hurt. In this article they say that the car would need a whole lot of sensors, on the left rear wheel a rotating sensor on the roof etc. If you ask me this sounds like i would be riding down the street in a space ship. It says they tested a car on an embedded track with electrial cables, thats not safe. Also it says it would be a massive amount of money to make these roads. Who has all that money to comtribute?\r\n\r\nThey say that the cars arent truley driverless, they still alert the driver to take over when certian things happen. So whats the point of a driverless car if its not technacally driverless? Even they ask themselves that in the article.\r\n\r\nThey say driverless cars are the new thing but recently BMW has came out with the \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" meaning you have to keep your hands on the wheels. This is the total opposite of driverless cars. I would choose this meathod. Speaking of BMW other high-end cars like: Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan are plannng to have driverless cars by 2020. If driverless cars are as safe as they say then why are they only happening in expensive/ High-end cars.",
        "Driverless cars are a good idea, but it has its flaws. Driverless are more prone to get into an accidents than cars with people actually driving them. First, the car is made up of a lot of sensors. The sensor on the roof is the most important one, and if that sensor gets damaged in any way the car couldn't drive itself. If someone was taveling on the road in that car, and the Rotating sensor stopped working then they would have to take over , and drive themselves. Also if a malfunction happened on a highway it can cause car crashes and such. While there are problems about the sensor privacy needs to be addressed too.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is a big thing too the \"Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining foucused on the road\" this shows that the manufactureres are watching people as they drive. People in the car would have no privacy cause the manufacturers are watching them. While privacy is a issue buying that can't drive itself is an issue too.\r\n\r\nThe car still \"requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents\" this shows that the driver must stay alert while its driving. Manufactueres have developed things to get people's attention whenever a problem occurs. Its like why would you pay for a driverless car that you still have to drive?",

        "Everyday people die in car crashes with them driving manually. So why would they trust a vehicle with a computer programming the vehicle? I believe that the driverless cars would be a tragic disaster in the world because, there could possibly be just as much car crashes. For example, Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, said that they would have to put sensors everywhere on the vehicle. What if one of the sensors were to brake or just go out while driving a person? Or if little kids were riding their bycicles on the streets and get hit by one of the vehicles?\r\n\r\nThese vehicles would not make a good impact on the world. Yes, it would be fun to experiment with but it wouldn't be when the vehicle goes dead on the streets and you have to get out and walk the rest of your destination. It could be possible that the GPS they were talking about putting in the car could go out and run a red light or stop sign and seriously injure or kill the passengers.\r\n\r\nHave they ever thought about a tire going out on a highway? You not having anywhere to go? Or having to wait on someone to come and get you? I believe that when they say the google car always lets you know if you are going to get into a car crash they are over-exagerating. Because, when you are driving you always have this think called a blind spot. If you have a blind spot then there is no way that the vehicle can see everything.\r\n\r\nThey say that the car can only speed up to 25mph, but when you are driving on\r\n\r\nhighway that isn't really helpful. Or if you are in a hurry to get somewhere that wouldn't be helpful either. The author says in paragraph 7 line 3-4 that they have special sensors to make sure that the person is holding on to the wheel when driving.",
        "Could you imagine everyone in the world driving in a vehicle that could control where and when you go somewhere? I think it would be absolute chaos. I couldn't imagine driving in a vehicle that could take control on it's own, It would be way to skeptical for me. I strongly disagree about driverless cars.\r\n\r\nFirst, driverless cars are not 100% durable nor safe. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, stated that \"General motors created a concept car that would run on a special track\". That track for these driverless cars were embedded with electrical cables that sent radio signals to the front of the car. In reality, no roads have any electrical currents running through them to make any car more secure. It's illegal in many states to even test computor cars because this company hasn't proved their car reliably safe. Driverless cars are in my opinion, not safe.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in this whole artical, I didn't hear one thing about the driverless car being able to sense any size animal. Animals cause many accidents or deaths in the U.S. Animals are dangerous when you're driving, and many are unpredictable. This car has lots of little gagets and electronics in it, I think it should at least help you predict or let you know when a animal is approaching.",

This technology is supposedly able to help find the emotions of a human and how they feel by recognizing their facial features and muscles.\r\n\r\nThis new technology FACS, known as the Facial Action Coding System reads the facial features and the way humans use their muscles in their faces to recognize their emotional state, whether they be happy, sad etc. This new technology would not benefit our society today for the reason that we have careers and jobs in understanding humans emotional state, the time, money and effort spent in learning this would all be replaced by a robot or new technology, this causes jobs to be lost and people that spent their lives and money learning this career are out of a job because of a technology. FACS is good in a way to survey an area of people but not a necessity to the world today.\r\n\r\nAlthough reading a students emotional state in a classroom is a good benefit and way to figure out whether or not that student needs more help or is the reason he/she are a disturbance in class or failing in a classroom. I believe it is a good thing to have at a school because kids today hide their emotions, and avoid socialization because of their emotional state, and if we have that today in our classrooms we could help kids grades rise, fights lessen, and even could stop bullying with knowing that a kid is in fear, why is he/she in fear? or a kid is sad? etc. These things help us understand what to do in order to keep the school safe and student happy in the classroom.\r\n\r\nIf the FACS is able to read students emotions and detect if that human is sad, happy etc. then yes this technology would be a great resource in the classroom or school today because of so many things happening over the world teachers and their staff should be able to use this technology to undestand their students emotions in order to help them in a classroom and figure out how to help them in academics for a better future. The article in this passage talks about how the FACS can even adress emotional views from a picture that dated back to the era when Da Vinci was painting, and this even could give us what emotion the Mona Lisa out out and how Da Vinci used facial features to depict emotion in his paintings, this could bring out the views of people back in the 1800s or even earlier.\r\n\r\nThough I am not for this technology for the fact that we do not need a machine or computer telling us what state of emotion were in, it could be a great use in the school board today with all the violence and cyber communication that happens.",
        "When one reaches 16 years of age, they have the ability to drive on their own in the streets but now, will one really need a driver's license? Google is in the process of making their own self driving cars to eventually put them out intothe world for everyone to have. These cars may have its good points but it also has its bad points. Ultimately, I think developing these cars are a bad thing to do. These cars may cause more lack of effort but also they cause danger to citizens, danger to the driver, and more problems for the company. You could even say one crash could cause an explosion.\r\n\r\nIn the text of \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", the author talks about the point of cars being developed by Google that do not need drivers to drive. The gives some positive aspects of the idea, but also negative. I think the negative rules out the positive. The text says \"even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or manufacturer?\" This point brings up the problems of the manufacturer/company, but also brings up the fact that an incident can in fact happen. \"In the case of an accident...if the technology fails\" are the points that show technology is not perfect, it has its flaws, so having technology take the wheel is just as bad as a person and maybe worse. \"traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars.\" States even say that the driverless cars must be restricted because of lack of safety. This quote shows that the driverless cars are overall not safe to civilians and the ones who, apparently, ride in it.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars may sound like a benefit but technology has the same what if risk as a person does. In the year of 2015, there has been more car crashes then there has been by far and that is because of texting and driving.",
        "Since 2009, google has been developing driverless cars. Cofounder of google, Sergey Brin, believes that with these cars it would \"fundamentally change the world\". More than a million people have droven the cars without any accidents but that driverless car isnt fully driverless it still requires the driver to take over at some points. I agree that driverless cars are the best new cars of the future that should be accepted.\r\n\r\nGoogle should work to make this car available to the public around the world because this new generation depends on technology. This new technology also makes people feel safer while driving on the road. In the passage it says\", Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors....The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel(5).\" The cars are programmed to go by human actions which may guarantee fewer accidents and crahes.",
        "The developmeant of driverless cars can be dangerous for our society. In 2009, Google made a car that could drive by itself, in certain conditions. These cars have been banned in certain states, it's against the law to test drive them in these states. How are we supposed to know how these cars do in other conditions if states have them banned for their states safety. Driverless cars can only assist us in driving not drive the car itself.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950's. General Motors made a car that could drive on its own, on a special test track. This special test track was \"embedded with eletrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever on the front end of the car\"(Driverless Cars Are Coming). This Track could easily stop the car if needed, but we dont know how it would do out in the real world with other people. There are alot of sensors on the car. On Google's modified Toyata Prius, There are sensors on the left rear wheel, a sensor on the roof. a camera ner the rearview mirror, automotive radar sensors and a GPS. Sure having a lot of sensors on a carwould help the car pick up motion around it, but what if somthing happened to the car, one of the sensors broke out, the the car wouldn't be able to pick up movement around the car. BMW, a car manufactuer, developed \"traffic jam assistant\"(Driverless Cars Are Coming). The car with traffic jam assistant can handle any driving function at 25 mph as long as the driver keeps their hands on the wheel. The car can steer by itself, which isn't safe because the car might see the need to turn itself in one direction and accidently hit a car.",
        "I beleive that the development of self driving cars would better our future. The introduction of self driving cars is a positive because they give the driver more freedom to do other productive things, they still give the driver some control over the car incase bad condition come up, and they use many different sensors to ensure the passengers safety.\r\n\r\nSelf driving cars give people the freedom to do more productive things instead of driving. This is helpful because people could get more work done in the car. Which in some cases people can commute many hours, giving them valuable time to work. A concern with this could be distracting the driver from being alert incase the car needs assistance. Although as stated in the article \"Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up display. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over\". This means that drivers could use the systems already put in the cars that are regulated by the car itself so that if there is an emergency, the car can shut down the devices.\r\n\r\nThe cars are smart enough to know when they should let the passeneger take over. This is important because it shows you that the cars still give you control in certain situations, and they only drive in conditions that would otherwise be easy. Stated in the article, it says \"In 2013, BMW announced the development of \"Traffic Jam Assistant\". Th car can handle driving functions at speeds of up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless\". This means that if the car starts to lose control or go into bad conditions, the passenger can take over.\r\n\r\nThe cars that are modified to be self driven are highly equipped with technology to help the car.",
        "Over time, we learned venus advanteges, and disadvanteges. Studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The more challeging it is to study venus, the more people want to explore.\r\n\r\nFirst about 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus. What's more challeging is the clouds of high corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmopshere. In venus the temperture average over 800 degree. Which is also more than we experenice in our plant.\r\n\r\nSecond Also Researchers would not be able to take any samples of whatever sort. This would be diffecult for researchers to contine with the mission. In order to get far more information is to find a way to get up close and personal to venus even if it is risky.\r\n\r\nLastly striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the plantet itself, also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally discoveries.",
        "Some people think that the face on mars was created by aliens. This essay will tell you that the face is just another one of Mars mesa or butte.\r\n\r\nThe face on mars was not created by aliens because there is no life on mars. The face looked like an alien artifact because the images were not sharp so you can't see that the face was just equivalent to a butte or mesa.",
        "\"Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\". Studying Venus is a worthy worth wild task despite the dangers that it involves. There are many positive things that may come out of exploring our dear neighbor Venus inlcluding how it might have once been just like Earth.\r\n\r\nVenus was once just like earth researchers have found many Earth like evidence to support this claim. Venus may have been fillwed with oceans once just like how we have them here. This planet may have had various form of life whether it be the tiniest things. Today there is still much evidence that can give off it has Earth type atmosphere. Such as the rocky sediments, the valleys, and the mountains. This way if we were to pursuit Venus we could cope with what we already know on about our planet Earth and how we have similar structures. It would be a worthy idea also because they have volcanoes and earthquakes some things we on earth have as well. We would be able to do this and discover if Venus was just like Earth.\r\n\r\nVenus can be a worthy pursuit because since it is not a far away planet we would be able to travel their with an advantage of it being close to Earth. Going to Venus would also be a the nearest option for a planetary visit as well. With not a single spacecraft touching Venus in 3 decades going back and replanning the visit to Venus would be a mega shock to others. Like as said in the paragraph Venus is around the same size and density of Earth so this would give our fellow space people a similarity of what Earth is like but in hotter and a bit more extreme troposphere.\r\n\r\nWith the improvement of technology we could have spacecrafts succefully land on Venus surface. Giving technology an area to expand as well this can also see what technology can do for us more in the future.",
        "On May 24, 2001, a NASA Viking 1 spacecraft had saw a landform on Mars that had happened to look like a human face. The spacecraft had taken pictures of this landform and show the world a few days later in order to attract people to Mars. Some people, like conspiracy theorists, say that it's evidence of alien life that NASA has hidden from the public, but if this had been something NASA was hiding, they wouldn't have show that photo at all to the public. Scientists and astronaunts have denied this by adding titles that suggest otherwise on there photos, showing the photo in the first place, and going back up to space to take more pictures.\r\n\r\nAccording to paragraphs 1 though 5, NASA had found a landforn that resembled a human face of an Egyptian Pharaoh located on a region called Cydonia. Mission control was surprised to see the face, but believed it was just another Martian mesa with unusual shadows, so they decided to reveal the pictures to the media, knowing there wasn't anything \"top secret\" or alien like about it. Then, according to paragraph 5, NASA had captioned the image, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,\" basically telling the public that it was just a quirky looking natural landform, not a big alien conspiracy theory. People defending the NASA budget even claimed they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars, basically meaning there wasn't life that they knew of.",
        "The Face is not a Alien made artifact because the scientist at NASA resherch and made diffrent trips to see the land formatin. The NASA camras did not make it easy to see if any thing was there. They went back 18 years later and took more pictures and found nothing that had to do with aliens makeing the landform.\r\n\r\nAt NASA the scientist it was a nother martin mesa because they are commen in that region of mars. They also said that the rock had no sign of alien life or ever haveing life. The large rock formation gave the shadow a alusion of the Face. When they went back in the summer of 1998 they took a picturre that proved that the large rock formation was just that.\r\n\r\nThe Face is not an alian made face because the scientist at NASA said the landform was giveing off a shadow alusion of a Face. There camras on the Viking 1 make it hard too tell if there was any thing there. They went back 18 years later an took more picture that were better because they had new tecnology.",
        "There are many conspiracies that the face was created by aliens but none of those conspiracies have evidence to back them up.From most information scientists have gathered they collected the information that it was just a natural landform. There is no evidential proof that aliens even exsist and many other things in space are created by natural landforms.When the web surfers surfed the web thet foiund the JPL image and it \"revealed that it ewas a natural lanform.There was no alien monument after all.\" There was also very similar rocks in the Amerucan West that formed naturally as well and that showed the the space rock can be formed the same way the other rocks were formed. As Garvin says in the article \"it reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" This means that this is not the only rock and there are other very similar one's that's why it is percieved to be a natural landform because if it was formed by aliens how did they do it very similar to the other's?\"If it looks like the other one's that it is easier to say that it is a natural landform.",
        "the usage of this new technology to read emotion has alot of potential for many things. It can read off your emotion even if your faking your smile, frown, etc. The use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable because it can benefit the students learning, it can make learning more enjoyable and can help the student with any conflict they are facing inside or outside of school.\r\n\r\nThis new usage of technology can be used to benefit many people. This new technology can benefit students by being able to know their emotional expression and how they feel that day this can lead to teachers helping cheer up the class if the majority are not doing the best. this could also detect the stress/worried emotion in a student letting a teacher now that they may be overworking their students. This is similar to how\r\n\r\nthey said \u00a8you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking on her face.\u00a8 if a teacher knew directly how stressed/worried you were they might slow down or postpone due dates for later dates.\r\n\r\nThis new technology can make the student into a new person and change their learning expierences. This new technology to read the emotional expressions of students can make a class enjoyable. For instance if you are not enjoying a class and or the class has always been boring or you know that you struggle in that subject this new technology can change that. This new technology can sense the emotions you feel class and inform the teacher on how you feel leading to the teacher making changes to the class or how he teaches. This was best explain when the article stated \u00a8A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, \u00a8Dr. Huang predicts. \u00a8Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\". this explains it all and how a teacher could use this to their advantage.\r\n\r\nThe usage of this new emotional expression reading technology could detect emotions that could cause dangerous things. for instance they can help a student who may be dealing with something outside or inside of the school.",
        "World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins in 1945. To help these countries recover their food supplies,animald and more,44 nations joined together and formed a UNRRA. The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The UNRRA hired \"Seagoing Cowboys\" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Like horses, young cows, and mules. So my friend and I signed up. We think you should sign up too.\r\n\r\nThe UNRRA was hiring \"Seagoing Cowboys\". This was a chance in a lifetime. It is good to join the UNRRA,because you help out people. It also helps you see new places you never been to. It helps you see new things. It a chance of a lifetime. You can buy things from every place you go too. You can tour around places. You can explore that new pace and you can also meet new people or friends. Maybe even if friends of your moved somwhere else you would probably go there country and see them.\r\n\r\nIt takes about two weeks to get from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern cost of the United States,and a month to get to China. Yes that might be awhile,but you can still do things on the boat. You also have to take care of the animals. You have to feed and watered two or three times a day. There is also a thing called night watchman.",
        "Things aren't always as they appear, just because it looks that way doesn't necessarily mean that it is that way. The formation on Mars does look like a face but it is just a land formation it's not like land formations are rare. Coincidences happen all the time, this is just one of those times. You can't judge something based on how it's looked, you have to really pay attention.\r\n\r\nFormations are a very common thing, both on Earth and on Mars. It is nothing strange, what is strange is that it looks like a head. But even at the picture was taken in 1976 with a much lower quality of camera so things wouldn't have looked as clear as a more modern camera, the other picture was taken in 2001, technology would have advanced and improved much in that time span as it was 25 years later. The quality would have improved so it would have been much easier to see and to know what it really was, it was just a coincidence and coincidences are just as common as land formations.\r\n\r\nCoincidences happen a lot, and this is just one of the instances that it happens. It may look like a face and something that was made but when you look at it again, with a different perspective you see what it really is. Like sometimes you will have food, like chips and it will look like a face or an object, but just because it looks like that doesn't mean that is that. Or sometime you will see something, but then have to look again to see if that's really what you saw, it's the same concept. Just because you see it doesn't mean it is that or that is even there.",
        "This face landform stucture found on Mars was not made by any living source. I belive nature took its course and it so happened to look like a face. Eyes, nose mouth it looks like a face no doubt about it, but it cannot be stuctured by living substances. Most scientists have been saying that this face was made by aliens, but I have to disagree. It just simply can not.\r\n\r\nI belive that the face on mars is just a natural landform because we do not even know if aliens exist in the first place. There is no prove that aliens exist so why are we jumping into the conclusion, assuming that aliens made this landform. Prove to me aliens exist then we can start thinking if they had anything to do with this. If not then I do not even think that aliens should be in this conversation. Also even If aliens made this landform that looks like a face, how can they make it like that. It is kind of a perfect face, and I belive that you need some technology to build a structure like that. I don't know how they could do all that by hand. Another topic about this landface I want to point out is the three photos. Have you not have noticed how the face changed every couple of years? Well I do. It makes me belive that nature has built that landface throughout the years withe the wind and rain and the planet shaking at times.",
        "I think driverless cars could be both a good and bad thing. A good thing would be that there wouldn't be alot of gas being used, and there wouldn't be a lot of cars. A bad thing, just like the article says, people would get bored not being able to drive. Another bad thing, is that the car is basically all computer, it could have a glitch or bug and someone could get hurt. Not all computers are good, some can malfuntion and not work right, leading to an injury.\r\n\r\nI agree with the article in paragraph 9, the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. I know not 100 percent of the time that's true,like when some people drive drunk or high, but most of the time it's safer with a human and not a computer. Humans are in control of where they go and what they do. Why let a computer do that for you?\r\n\r\nBy 2020, there will be alot more opinions about this whole driverless car thing. Right now I feel that the world is okay the way it is. I also see the good this in this car too. Less fuel being used, meaning more earth to enjoy. All the smoke from cars now is bad, in 2020 I hope there will be less smoke. Some people need to get out and see the world, and with this driverless car, people can travel anywhere they want and see what ever they want.",

If you got in one of these \"driverless cars\" you would be accountable for any damage done because you were supposed to be alert while riding in this driverless car.The development of driverless cars should cease because the car still needs human assistance,the car is not safe and the car weakens drivers alertness.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are not what they seem,false advertisement, you still have to drive them at some point. An article says that these cars are unable to direct through traffic or pull out of drive ways, the complicated things. If the car unables the driver to get out of doing the complicated work ,why have one ? The article also states the car is supposed to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Drivers do not need another human to take the wheel they can do it themselves, drivers need advanced technology to take the wheel , because all humans make mistakes, technology does not. Driverless cars are not good on highways because what if there is an accident on the highway and the driver is not alert, the car does not know how to detour its way around.Driverless cars are supposedly good on \"smarter roads\" , not every road is a smart road.

        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" sounds very interesting, but my arugement on this is article is against it because it sounds very unsafe. What if the driverless care malfunctions and you arent paying attention and get involved in the accident? Will the company of the car help you or give you another car or maybe even pay what is costed for the whole situation? Probably not. Its not worth making or even buying one of the driverless cars. Even a car itself malfunctions.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars can cost up to millions of dollars or even more. Driverless cars sound like you need to get one and leave the old one. The fact that the driverless car may be really expensive is ridiculess. Only famous people can afford it. Maybe other weathly people can. Not just anyone will be able to afford the car. Any person can afford a car at least that works even if it is an old car. Cars can cost lots of money when you can buy something else.\r\n\r\nMany, many people want this car because you dont have to drive but when there is an alert you have to drive. Also it requires a driver anyways. Many people want this car because you can just get one and it will drive by itself so that person can get one his or her phone while the car is in operation itself.

In the third paragraph it says \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.\" That statement proves that Venus is far too dangerous for human contact.\r\n\r\nIn spite the dangers of Venus, astronomers still discussing visits to this planet because they are fasinated by it because it may once have been the most \"Earth like\" planet in the solar system. As of right now there are no machines that could stand a chance on Venus because it is so dense. NASA is trying to work on different approaches to study Venus, in paragraph 6 is says \"peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of ligth cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of phtography and videogrphy ineffective.\" This statement proves that even when you are above Venus it is sill far too dangerous because of the dense atmosphere.",
        "Using this technology to read emotional expressions on students in a classrooom is not valuabe, because students and pretty much every human has a right to and does require their own personal space.\r\n\r\nPersonal space is something that might be broken by trying to aquire students feelings and emotions through a laptop. Hypothetically speaking , when your friend is upset you can see this emotion clear as day, and if you ask them what's wrong and you don't get a response, you may ask around to see if anyone knows, but hopefully you'd never try and put their face into a computer and try to read their emotions.\r\n\r\nAnother value to the everyday human that would be broken is privacy. The Mona Lisa might have been able to be read because it was a painting of what a young lady was feeling like eons ago, so it couldn't tell you if it wanted to be read or not, but a human being should have the right to express their emotions out loud or keep it to themselves, depending on how they feel about. Using a computer to tell their emotions just totally breaks all the rules to privacy, especially when it's being performed by a teacher or other students, which in hand would also waste time in the classroom.",

It be awesome to read somebody's emotions thorugh a machine. it would tell you alot about what a person is feeling and thats important to know. their are many excellent and well reasoned examples of why this technology is valuable.\r\n\r\nMy one reason i believe this is valuable technology is if somebody was feeling depressed and was not willing to open up to anybody that individual could do self harm to himself. If they know how that individual was feeling maybe they would have helped he/she. in the passage it says \" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused and bored\". Then Dr. Huang says\" then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This technology could become really usful for many different situations. Thats one of the reasons of why this makes this machine so valuable.\r\n\r\nThe creator of FACS[ [Facial Action Coding System] Dr. Paul Eckman has \"classified six basic emotions\". The machine can read happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. this type of technology can aid and solve world wide problem. For example what if an individual person or more were having issues with a certain subject at school but dont know how to ask for help. The Computer would make \" 3-D computer model of the face\" and they can anaylze what they might be feeling about the subject. then thats when the help comes.\r\n\r\nAnother example is reading different emotions is some how very important. It can be used against people who have commited crime.",
        "In the article \"Umasking the Face on Mars\", there are diffrent theories on what exactly they think this is. The logical answer is that the face is just a natural landfrom the article states not logical reasons and conspiracy theories not provided from NASA, they have done their research.\r\n\r\nDuring the article it provides pictures varying in dates from 1976, 1998 and 2001. Over these years it begins to form and show more. Its classified that it really is just a mesa. Different research and other many pieces of evidence back up this statement. It is just a natural landfrom.\r\n\r\nTwenty five years ago when the viking 1 was out it spotted the likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles end to end. They unveiled it as a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. Others refused to belive this and insisted that the NASA had to be covering up something, even though they provided all the research and more than needed.\r\n\r\nThe \"Face on Mars\" attracted films, books, magazines, radio talks. Some people still thought the face of it being something else was something they would rather hide than bring to the public eye. Even though they had all the facts and research to back up their theory of exactly what it was.",

        "About 25 years ago, NASA's Viking 1 and Viking 2 spotted what seeemed to be a giant face that resembled an Egypt Pharoah. Could this be an alien artifact? Haha,..nope just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nOnly a few scientist thought that the face was an artifact, but as soon as NASA heard this the made it a priority to go back and photograph Cydonia once again. Jim Garvin says \"We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" (Paragraph 6) This mean if it was an alien artifact NASA would have made money and benifited from finding this.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Michael Malin went back and photgraphed this again it revealed only a natural landform.(Paragraph 7) Later when others went back again to photograph it they were fortunet enough to get close enough to get a clear picture.",
        "In my english class, we are reading a book about outliers, and that is the first thing I think about when I think about driverless cars. Many people think that outliers in every situation is a good thing; not in this case. I do not believe that driverless cars is a good idea. I believe this because of false advertisement, reaction speed, and liability\r\n\r\nWhen I think of driverless cars, the first thing that I think of is that this vehicle will get me from point A to point B without me having to worry about anything. That is where the false advertisement comes in.\" In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driveless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but all are designed to notify the driver when the roads ahead need human skills\"\r\n\r\nIf I am purchasing this car, I wanna be with out a care in the world. I want to know that im gonna be able to get to where I need to be.\r\n\r\nI have had my license all of 3 months, and have experienced, getting cut off, rear ended, and much much more. These driverless cars will not react fast enough well to many decisions that a regualar person would still stuggle with. Imagine stopping at a red light; it turns green and you go. You look both ways while driving and see somebody run a red light who would of hit you if you werent more causious. \" The google car simply anoounces when the driver should be prepared to take over.\" No one would be able to react quick enough to these risk, which is why driverless cars is not a good idea.",
        "Exploration is key to a humans curiosity.Many people will indeed be anxious to explore something that is said to be impossible or dangerous because of curiosity.\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is a prime example. In this article the author states different reasons why it is worth stuying Venus depite the extreme dangers it brings.\r\n\r\nOne reason why the author of this article supports his ideas well is because he used statistics or in other words he used pathos.In paragraph five, he said\"...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\"He mentioned the idea of NASA creating a \"blimp-like\" vehicle to fly over the Venusian landscape.Then he went on and entered his counterclaim by saying\"...far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground condition...,\"therefore Venus would only be visible but not accesible and NASA would not be able to take samples of the planet.\r\n\r\nSecondly,he states some facts about Venus itself.He added that \"...Venus is the closests planet to Earth in terms of density and size.\"This is a good fact to add in to give the idea as to why NASA would choose to attempt studying Venus.Also he siad that\"...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.\"This gives the idea that the study of Venus has already been attempted before and has unfortunately failed every single time.\r\n\r\nLast but not least,in his conclusion he built a strong conclusion by mentionding in his opinion that\"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginataion and innovation.\" This can be used for both life and NASA continuing on trying and trying until they succesfully study Venus.",
        "A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to recognize emotions. As mentioned in the article, this technology can be useful in many formats; including psychology, art, and acting. Reading human emotions can be beneficial in some areas, but it is not valuable in the classroom setting because each student learns differently, computers should not be used as teachers, and the cost is not worth few benefits.\r\n\r\nIn the article, Dr. Huang predicts that with the new technology, the computer can recognize when a student is confused or bored and change the lesson to fix it. While this seems helpful, not every student learns the same way. A lesson that some students will understand, other students will be confused on. It would not be fair to the students who understand the lesson to make it easier because they might become bored, which the computer would then have to modify the lesson more to fix. The Facial Action Coding System is able to read human emotions, but it cannot satisfy the need of each individual student in a classroom. This technology also is not valuable to the classroom because a computer instructor is not valuable to the classroom in the first place. Computers should not be used as teachers because it can unemploy teachers, completely change the education system, and possibly bore students.",
        "The\r\n\r\nauthors claim on why we should keep on studying so we can land on venus has alot of great idea and points but i dissagree with him. I feel like we should not land on venus anytime soon because its way to risky and its not a habital place. Another reason why we should not\r\n\r\ngo on there is because its way too dangerous and not alot a people wouldwanna risk therre lives like that.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n\r\nthe article there is many reasons why they think we should try to land on venus even with ll the dangers. One reason is that they can make suits that will help the with the heat since its 170 degrees on that planet. Also they say that venus used to be\r\n\r\nan earth like planet where they think some type of people could of lived there. Lastly landing on venus could give us life changing information about or solar system and it can also give us a technology leap and we could start advancing in technolgy.\r\n\r\nIn conculsion there are many dangers to visting venus and NASA and other space companies are down to take that risk to see what is on that planet.",
        "The author didnt support this claim very well. The author talked alot about the dangers in Venus rather the good that comes from Venus. I say this because as I am reading I see how the author mentions many of times how Venus has extreme tempetures and how no one has went to Venus because of these extreme conditions.\r\n\r\nThe author says in paragraph 2 ,\"Numerous factors contribute to Venus\u0092s reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.\" Which gives the idea that it is a very dangerous place. You may begin to question \"Why would any one want to go to Venus\" or you may say to yourself \"This is not any where that i would want to go.\" The author also states in paragraph 3,\" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus\u0092s atmosphere.\" This is even more if a danger sign. No one would want to be anywhere where you could potentially suffocate. We also know from this paragraph that Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.",
        "Venus is the planet with the most similarities to our planet Earth. Venus is most definitely something worth exploring it is similar to our planet earth, it is dangerous, and it is just fascinating to explore different places.\r\n\r\nVenus is very much alike our planet earth Astronomers think that long ago Venus was covered in oceans and could have supported life. Venus also has many planet like structures for example valleys, mountains, craters, and much more. In pragraph 4 it says \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth today... The planet has a surface of rocky sedimemt and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" That shows how Earth and Venus are so much alike.\r\n\r\nEven though Venus is so much alike Earth it is way more dangerous. For example Venus temperature is way hotter than our temperature becaus it is closer to the sun and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to. I know that Planet Venus is a dangerous planet because in paragraph 3 it says \"A thick atmoshphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosohere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greaterthan what we experience on our own planet\" This proves that the conditions on Planet Venus is far to dangerous for us humans to be able to withstand.\r\n\r\nWith that being said Astronomers and scientists still believe it is worth exploring Venus because it is such a fasncinating planet.",
        "In the story the author presented both sides fairly. He stated the positives and negatives of driverless cars. I belive that driveless cars could soon be a common thing everybody uses.\r\n\r\nFirst thing that might be a big problem is that they use radars and those can cost two hundred million dollars, that right there is a down side. One of the positives of the car it can do is that BMW announced the \"Traffic Jam Assistant.\" The car can go as fast as 25 mph, but you have to keep you're hand's on the wheel. The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. It is all design to let the driver know the road ahead requires human skills, such as nabigating through work zones and around accidents. BMW's project manager driver said that it hopes to bring in-car entertainment and information systems. Some of the display can be turned off when the driver must take over. The in-car system is a great safety feature. One of the biggest down fall is the law. The law focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. They also said that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Because of this most states, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Some manufactures believe that even more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe. One of the biggest question is that if the technology fails and someone happens to be injured, who fault is it? Is it the driver or the manufacturer? I believe it would be the drivers fault because it was there fault they decide try to have a driveless car. This is one reason many people won't want to buy those type of cars. Even thought it has a big problem it can also be use for good things. Google cofounders said he can foresees they the cars will use half the fuel of today's taxi and is far more flecibiloty than a bus.",
        "Many people are thinking that the \"face\" on Mars is an actual face, or they say it was created by aliens. It was proven very well that it is not an actual face. One it is an rock, two the angle the camera was at cought the shadow of it so it seemed as if it was a face, and three the only reason it was told to be a face was for marketing.\r\n\r\nMy first reason was because it is a rock on mars. It states in paragraph three that it is a huge rock in formation of a human head. therefore that is one reason it is showing everyone that it is just a rock. The rock over the years has wathered down and it has more crevisises and it is losing the foerm of a face. If there was an actual face barryed under there it would never really lose its true form.\r\n\r\nMy second reason is that the angle of the camera was so that you can see the shadow and if they just wouldve gotten a better angle you woyld be able to see that there was nothing really there. If you were too also look at othere surroundings you would be able to see that there are many other masas on Mars. It also states that it may have been the pixles in the cameras. If we had the technology we have now when they first found it you would most likely have a better picture of it and be able to see what it actually looked like.\r\n\r\nMy final reason for it not being a face is that the only reason they continued on the theory of it being a face because they wanted good marketing.",
        "In this passage \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", the author made very detailed and valid points about the use of technology detecting what our expressions say about our moods, but, technology reading students facial expressions is over the top. I belive that this new technology would force students to always want to force a smile so that the computer doesn't fully recognize their real from their fake. In this essay I am going to tell you about my opinions on why I think that this new technology is bad for anyone to even have.\r\n\r\nFirst, I would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table, but who would want to feel like their being watched? \"For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" This information is truly invalid. Smiling at an ad does not make it appear the next time you get on a different website, and frowning at an ad doesn't change it either. It's the way the ads are set up that it makes them leave or come back. Student's shouldn't have to feel like they have to fake their emotions just so that the computer doesn't recognize how they feel in reality.",
        "In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author is stating that he thinks people should study Venus. The author stated many reasons on why he thought they should study Venus no matter what the dangers or conditons are on the planet. I think it would be good to explore and study Venus because it was stated to be very similar to how Earth is now.\r\n\r\nThe author stated Venus is offten referred to as Earth's \"twin\", and that it is sometimes one of the closest planets to Earth besides Mars. Venus is also called the \"Evening Star\", because sometime you can see it from Earth. The tempatures on Earth and Venus are very differant, although the author thinks that at one point, Venus could of had living people, oceans, and could of been very close to how Earth is now. Venus still has features that make it similar to Earth.\r\n\r\nVenus now has a differant atmosphere. The atsmosphere is thicker and 97 percent carbon dioxide. NASA has tried to study Venus in the past, but no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA has not tried to take any kind of space craft to Venus for more than 3 decades. On Venus, the surface averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The conditions are for more extreme. Venus has the hottest suface temperature of any other planet.",
        "Have you ever wanted to spend more time with your family? Well you may have that opportunity sometime in the future. Even as we go about our daily lives people somewhere are working to make that happen. With driverless cars we can spend more time with our family. The driverless car will no doubt help lessen the accidents caused by cars, it will also allow you to do something more important than driving on your way to and from work, and it will help keep your children under control because of you being able to talk to them about their actions in the backseat of your car.\r\n\r\nAutomated driving will help stop accidents from happening. Driverless cars are safer because they use sensors rather than the human attention span. Also driverless cars have an automatic brake system in a child or car got in front of the car at any time the car would be able to stop before collision. The cars will also allow everything to be more electronically inclined. If we get automated cars it will change how we live and our productivity.\r\n\r\nWhile driving a car you have to pay a lot of attention to any hazards that may come along, and you don't have any time to work on the project for your workplace. While you are driving you could have been working on said project, but you couldn't due to the fact that you had to pay attention to the road. If we develope automated cars it will help bring work productivity up and sales along with it. The economy could really get a boost from them. Which would help people get jobs and more people would come out of poverty. Which could help us pay more attention to the future generation.",
        "Driverless cars have seem to have made a name for themselves throughout history. Not only have you seen some driverless cars on movies, they are actually being tested for human use! Even though it seemed to be some kind of fantasy, it is coming, and coming fast. Driverless cars should be created for humans to not only avoid accidents but for other uses.\r\n\r\nThe most common use for a driverless car is safety. Humans are fond of making mistakes, its nature. Sooner or later, driverless cars will take care of accidents for you. Some are being tested by Google, BMW, and GM. Though, none have been released for public use, many have been able to test with some driverless cars.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of driverless cars can be a full list. People who have jobs one day will run late. If so, that one day can be taken care of by a driverless cars, not only getting ready in your car is a convenience but a blessing. It could and might just save you your job! Many laws are enlightened to keep both your hands on the wheel, but with driverless cars you don't need any. Just think of the things you could do in a car driven by a computer.\r\n\r\nSafety has seemed to be a problem with the cars being built lately. Some driverless cars have had malfunctions here and there. Cameras have been installed inside and outside of cars to see where many occur. The side of the car is the most dangerous to get hit by. Creators of these cars have made the car resond to computer-based brakes.",
        "I believe that we should not use driverless cars, in my opinion they are an accident wating to happen. The arguments saying we should switch to driverless cars sound far fecthed. The text uses statements such as, \"the cars would use half the fuel of todays cars\", \"they offer more flexibility\", and that \"they are much safer\". These arguments are invalid in many ways that I will explain.\r\n\r\nThey text says that driverless cars would be cheaper than cars that require a human to handle them, but they are not. Driverless cars aren't even driverless, they still require a human skill to take over when the car cannot comprehend what to do next. Driverless cars would be much more expensive to obtain and operate than a normal car. Driverless cars have many different extremely expensive gadgets needed to even make it semi-automatic, they require position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor. A normal human operated vehicle does not require any of those things, so if a person did wish to get a driverless car, they would be paying a substantial amount of money and even more for fuel, to keep up with the parts and technology, and for gas. With a manual car all you have to do is purchase it (for a much smaller amount) and pay gas money and body shop bills should they arise, but still yet, it would be a lot less than the driverless car.\r\n\r\nThe text also states the driverless cars offer more flexibility than a manual car, this is untrue, they actually offer less. With a manual car, you are the driver and you choose where to go and what to do, with the driverless car you are supposed to tell your GPS where to take you and that's all the input you have.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System is a great achivement in science and technology, but should it be used in your computer at school? There are many reasons why using this coding systam could be a great thing in the class room, or a disaster. As stated in the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, if we could put this in our everyday school computers, it could calculate whether or not a student is having trouble with a lesson and change it for them to help them. What are the pros? What are the cons?\r\n\r\nSome of the pros to using this coding system in students computers is as stated in the article, it could read the studens facial expresssions and determan if he or she is confused or having trouble understanding the lesson. If it could do this it could change the way the lesson it tought better helping the student understand.\r\n\r\nBut what if schools dont teach lessons online. For example, my school does not teach lessons online. Our teachers might give us website addresses to look up and use for studying, depending on the teacher. Unlike other schools around me that do E-learning. They either stay at home, or go to school and do a whole days work off of their school issued computers. This Facial Action Coding System would work greatly for those students that do E-Learning, but not so much for the ones that don't.\r\n\r\nSecondly, does this system cost anything?",

When explaining the type of features Venus has, the author mentions that it has signs of physical features that Earth has right now. The author states that some of the familiar features are valleys, moutains, and craters and probably convered in oceans. A lot like Earth. By addressing the fact that Venus has signs of similar physcial features as Earth, the author makes the point that if we continue to study Venus we can learn more about Earth and what could possibly happen to Earth.

For example in paragraph two they say the car cannot operate or minuver through traffic , road blocks, accidents etc.\r\n\r\nSo what if there's a storm, or a tornado, or earth quake or something? Will the car know what to do then? If you're going to have to take over you might as well drive it yourself anyway. What could you possibly do for those short moments of time anyway? A driver is always supposed to stay alert and focussed no matter what. Whether you are driving or not because you never know what could happen. Safety first! I dont think a computer is accuipt enough or qualified to think , act, or make decisions a human is supposed to make.\r\n\r\nThen what happens if you do decide to let the car do what it is programed for and ypou do get in accident or get hurt? Then what like they said in paragraphs 9 & 7, the big argument will be who,s fault is it, the driver or manufacturer?",

More importantly scientist cannot take sample rock from other world to do research.\r\n\r\nSecondly if Scientit don't study about the planet of Venus we will not know nothing about the planet itself. If they don't study about Venus we will not know what happen in the begining on Venus. We will also not know if life exist on Venus. We will also not know is Venus a planets or a star and what is the closest planet to Venus.",
        "\"Hmmmm, i think it would be great to have others in the Seagoing Cowboys program.\" Luke Bomberger is apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program and thinks it would be great if new faces would join the program as well. So Luke is thinking about how he'd get the message out to people so they could probably be in the program. ''I should talk to the others and see what they think.\" Luke said, so he spreads the word to the other guys and they all think it's a great idea. Luke was amazed everyone was wanting others to join the program also. All of a sudden luke thought to himself ''We'll be getting back on board in three more days. So he told the guys that they need to get the word out to as many people as they could instantainiously. So they thought of a plan then one of the guys blurted out and said, 'since were on land right now we could probably find a radio station around here.\" So the other guys gave him a high five and telling him that's an brilliant idea. So the guys took a map and started roaming around seeing if they could find a radio station. And about two hours later of searching they finally found a little radio station in the middle of no where.",
        "The Face of Mars was a historic discovery, and not because it was a new kind of land form. When the photo was first released, many thought it was an alien structure and that it proved there once was life on Mars. NASA then worked harder to understand the strange picture and to change the opinion of skeptics who tried to make it an ancient temple.\r\n\r\nThe first photo that was released was a low quality picture and the strange shadows gave it the look of a face. NASA began to obsess about the face and they began to get better and better resolution photos. It became more apparent that the face was just a mesa, which were common in the area. Skeptics insisted that NASA proves that is just a hill and NASA continued finding out more about the mesa. as the resolution improved, nearly all second-guessers were silenced. This happened because scientists were convinced that this landform was much like the Middle Butte in Idaho, which was most definately not made by aliens.",

And he has many reasons for thinking and suggesting it and here the way that he says that it would be worthy of pursuit is by putting facts that would be helpful in the article.\r\n\r\nSome of the advantages that the article would have is that it is very well informed and it have a lot of evidence that we could use to say that it is a study that is worthy of pursuit. In the articleit says\u00b4Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and occasionaly the closest in distance to\u00b4.This is saying that venus is closer to us and we have more adantage of knowing more about it because more people can go on it since it is closer.

        "Was there another Earth like the one you are living on right now? I and all the NASA researchers ask you this question in a sense that you will understand. Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago Venus was probaly covered with oceans and life forms. We know this because Venus has surface features that look like Earth's. Through the use of technology, researchers found valleys, mountains, and craters on Venus, leading us to think that it is extremly similar to Earth.\r\n\r\nVenus is the second clost planet to the sun and regulates a 800 degree temperature on it's surface. The atmosphere is also covered in thick sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide clouds (author 3). These vile conditions make it impossible for technology to touch the surface. You may ask if it's impossible why are we still trying. The answer is that Venus is extremly similar to Earth and could possibly reveal secrets of the universe.\r\n\r\nThrough technology researchers have found reminents of valleys, mountains, craters, and oceans. Making it possible that a form of life was once there. Was there life? What happened to the planet?",
        "The new technology is very helpful showing about whats more to a picture or a frame. Why is this important well beacuse people want to know about more about the picture or of what the picture is showing for example, Mona Lisa smile to not be so serious in the picture imagine having a cute picture but your so serious. You can change that with new tecnology. Comperters are very helpful theses days in many ways. For example it can be useful for making payments , searching up information you need , paperwork, photoshop, diffrent apps that are useful on making your life better. Its a better sorce of seaching stuff up learning more about the world and the physics. Theres more to this i mostly use it for searching up information about the topic i want to learn about. Its easier for me beacuse i dont like rreading alot and i can just look up videos instead of having to sit there for an hour looking up information or reading it beacuse reading makes me sleepy. Thats why i think the web is an awsome resorse for people that need to be informed and thought many diffrent things.\r\n\r\nMany people use this method by making there photogrophy work look better than it is. Its a very good sorce for people that have the job as a photographer beacuse they will make everything work in many ways. For example if something in the picture gets in the way the computer will show u how to get rid or it instead of doing all the extra stuff on taking a whole lot of pictures that look the same or worst. Why waist your time on doing that instead get the app or the program and get to steping its way better and easier to get pictures that are perfect.",

This is saying that the natural landform is formed by shadows.\r\n\r\nAnd another thing is that they went again to see if they could take a picutre again of the natural landform but, they had a better camera they would allow them to see better if it was true that the natural landform was true. \" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 metters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.\".

        "Ever have a happy feeling where you can't stop smiling or felt that dearth of happiness to where you may possibly cry? Those are part of your emotions, something every human being has. Dr. Paul Eckman has created valuable technology to help show a persons emotions. Dr. Huang helps us reveal much of the sciene of emotions.\r\n\r\nYour face is fraught with 44 different major muscles. These muscles move around in various ways to show emotion as well as other activities used by you face. These muscles have been programed into a 3-D computer based program also known as FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to help scientist show someone's different emotions. Dr. Paul Echman, the creator of FACS, has classified the six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with charecteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, when you raise your eyebrows, you use the frontalis pars lateralis muscle showing that you're surprised. You use your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) to tighten your lips to show anger.\r\n\r\n\"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\" observes Dr. Huang,\"even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.\" One example of this is not smiling as broadly. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks facial moventens. How can this be benifital to teacher and in everyday classroom studies? Teachers can use this to tell how a student my feel emotionally.",
        "The author claims that exploring Venus despite the dangers is a worthy pursuit. Which it may or may not be. They tell us about the dangers in pressure and heat on the surface of Venus and how it may stop us from getting to there physically. The author also explains how we could explore our sister-planet, Venus in a couple ways and tries to put it into perspective for us.\r\n\r\nThe author starts with talking about previous missions to reach Venus that ended unsuccessful due to Its harsh surface and atmosphere. The atmosphere of Venus is almost 97% carbon dioxide and to add onto that the clouds carry highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Making it difficult already to get a human or anything really through just the atmosphere living. The surface of Venus can average over 800 degrees farenheit along with the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than our own. These conditions are far too much for a human to make it to the surface of Venus which can set back this exploration of Venus.\r\n\r\nMoving on further the author states \"If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?\" He/She answers this question with the thought that long ago Venus may have been just like the earth we live on now. Covered in stable land and oceans, supporting many lifeforms, and maybe vegetation. Reason for thinking this is even today Venus has some features that are similiar to Earth. The rocky sediment surface, valleys, mountains, craters all show similiarity between Venus and earth. The author seems to want a return to Venus because we may be able to find more clues for this thought.\r\n\r\nThe author sees a return to Venus as indisputable, but questions, \"What are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive.\" They answer this question by proposing an idea by NASA to send humans to Venus. This idea would be a possible solution to avoid the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus. A blimp-like vehicle that hovers over the surface of Venus keeping them from the harsh conditions.",
        "Well, first of all I agree with the new technology called the Facial Action Coding Systyem that enables computers to identify human emotions and I think the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because some students might be having some troubles fixing their emotions, and i'm not sure if the essay is to write about the teachers using it to read the students emotions or it is the students theirselves that are using it to read their own expressions, eitherway i'm going to write about the two topics. About what I said about the students fixing their emotions is that some of the students might be so emotional that any little thing like when someone curses them they start crying, they might want to use this technology to see how their emotions are high or low, so they keep track of it and reduce the emotions till their brave enough to face anyone without having a lot of fear in them. And some of the students might have too much anger and they want to reduce it before it cause trouble for them and they might try it(Facial Action Coding System.)",
        "In the year of 1976, an object was discovered that looked like a human face on the planet Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars and taking pictures of possible places for Viking 2 to land. This 'human head' as they call it stretched two miles from each end of Mars. The passage states, \"It seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.\" NASA believed that there must have been a degree suprise among the mission controlers at the Jet Propulsion Lab when this 'Face' appeared on their monitor screens.\r\n\r\nDays after this what seemed to be 'human face' was released for all to see. The authors say, \"It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" It did! NASA decided to call it \"Face on Mars.\" This 'Face' became a popular icon throughout the world. The text states, \"It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" This object on Mars lead people to think that maybe there really was life on Mars.\r\n\r\nWhen the MGS arrived at the Red Planet in September of 1997, 18 years after the Viking missions ended photogrpahing, Cydonia was still a big priority for NASA. Chief scientist, Jim Garvin says, \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" Jim believed it was important to taxpayers. One year later on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time takig a picture that was ten times sharper and more clear than the photos taken by Viking. Thousands of people were waiting for the picture of the Face to appear on their monitor screens any minute.\r\n\r\nNot everyone was satisfied with the picture of the Face that was taken that day. The author states, \"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.\"",

Even though it will be a struggle to study Venus it would be worth it beacuse it could be a second earth. It would be hard to get on the surface of Venus the average temperature is over 800 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe study of Venus would be hard but NASA has one compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. They would have to hover/float above the fray at about 30 or more miles above the landscape and the air pressure would be close to Earth sea levels it wont be an easy conditons for humans but surviable. However they would have to get close to Venus surface so that they could get rock samples. That's why the author says they would need to make a machine to last a long enough time to cotribute meaningfully on Venus.

In many aspects, not to mention. Landforms, shadows, and shading galore. In pictures, the face seems to contain basic details to give t the \"person\" type of vibe off. However, there is just one problem.\r\n\r\nWith the face being known as looking human, there are details still missing. Such as, the rest of the body.

        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author argues the point that exploring Venus is worth the effort and risks exhibited. The author claims that, despite the harsh conditions and deadly atmosphere, this planet is worth travelling to and observing, due to its being the \"nearest option for a planetary visit\". While the author does list a few good reasons for Venus exploration, it is my belief that they also include many reasons not to explore this dangerous planet. This inclusion of the \"cons\" of exploration hurts the thesis more than it helps it, and damages the authors argument.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of their argument, the author states that \"no spacecraft survived the landing [on Venus] for more than a few hours\" and that \"not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades\". The usage of these statements creates a negative image, which can lead readers to believe that the exploration of Venus is too dangerous to enagage in. Furthermore, the author uses facts intended to continue to convince readers that Venus is dangerous, when this is exactly the opposite of what the author is arguing for. Making statements which invoke fear or apprehension only pushes the reader away from the topic, instead of influencing him or her to gain interest in it. For instance, when the author uses phrases with negative connotations, such as \"thick atmosphere\", \"corosive sulfuric acid\", \"800 degrees Fahrenheit\", and \"extreme\", they influence readers negatively as well.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the author provides little reasoning behind the belief that humanity should explore the planet Venus.",

        "My personal position on this matter is against cars driving themselves. Because with this new techology a person must still have to drive but only in some sitations, if the car drives itself for most the time then when a person is crossing the road the car will do one of two things. If the car sees the person and does not know what to do it will signal the driver, but if the driver is not prepared or not watching the road the driver cannot respond in time to save that persons life. Another outcome can be if the radar is not facing the person the car will not \"see\" the human crossing and when the hits the person who is the murderer? Is it the car or the driver.\r\n\r\nAs shown at the end of paragraph 9, when there is a fight in court about an accident who is liable?

That person could go to jail for not watching the road, when all that driver did was trust the car. I have read the article and never did say anything about a override from the driver. Which means if the driver did see the person crossing the road and he/she wanted to stop they couldn't and then when the person is hit and killed are they now responsable for this crime.\r\n\r\nMost of auto-cars alert the driver to take control if there is roadwork ahead. As shown on paragraph 2, but can the driver be alerted in time to stop a crash? Which causes even more possible problems, as explained in paragraph 7, none of the cars are driverless and there are a few ways been made to alert the driver like vibrating seats and flashing lights.",
        "In World War 2, I was asked if I wanted to join thew UNRRA to become a seagoing cowboy. I believe that you and others should join because you maybe be helping your country and other countries.

I really think you should join because it is a really fun experince.\r\n\r\nI have multiple reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys of the UNRRA. One reason you should join is that you could sightseeing while you are picking up the animals from the country ar in or on the way to other countries. Another reason you should join this program is when you turn 18 you could join other military services and other projects like this one. The thrid reason is the you get work with animals such as young cows, mules ,and horses. Final reason is that when you ngo from country to counrty you will go relaxz and have fun with your mates and you could final read that book you been wanting to read. Those are my reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.\r\n\r\nAfter all of these reasons would you want join the program.",

It is proved that Venus is a challenging place to examine closely because it has a lot of stuff that humans can not experience. Venus is a challenging planet for human to study closely because there are stuff that are extremely dangerous for humans and that humans can not do such as: Venus is not always close to Earth, the temperature and atmosphere is greater than what we experienced in Earth and it's danger to get to Venus.\r\n\r\nVenus moves a lot from us or we move a lot from venus. There are differences from Venus and us what I mean with that is that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. In paragraph 2, the authors said humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and that there is not a single spaceship that has survived the landing for more than a few hours and has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.\r\n\r\nThe temperature and atmosphere in Venus is greater than in Earth.

It could also help a teacher find out how to teach a specific subject the way thsts most beneficial to students. The computer reading emotions could help with that by letting the teacher know a kid is confused about something.

        "In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worth-while task. Although Venus poses many risks to humans and technology, the information and resources that can be taken from Venus are overwhelming.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the article, the author explains the many complications that come along with trying to study Venus. Previously, more than three decades ago, there were numerous attempts to study Venus, but shorty after landing spacecrafts, they were destroyed due to the conditions. This is because of the daunting environment Venus possesses, the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, temperatures can acceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure on Earth. Although these environmental factors seem to be disasterous for almost anything that would dare set foot on the planet, the author decribes two possible ways to get around this delima. First the author describes an idea posed by NASA. NASA says that sending people to Venus is possible, as long as they're above the intense conditions of the planet. They say that hovering at around the height airplains fly in hot airbaloons, humans could uncomfortably survive. Second, simple systems that use mechanical parts, have been proven to last up to three weeks in a simulated recreation of Venus. Theses \"rovers\" could prove useful for grathering test samples that the balloons above the atmosphere would not be able to, also they would be able to take greater quality pictures and study the land more effectively.",
        "The author supports the suggestion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by providing benifits and solutions to exploring Mars.\r\n\r\nIn the text it states 'Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like plantet in our solar system'. This shows that by studying Venus we may learn that Venus was once like Earth.\r\n\r\nIn the text it also states 'recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit'. This shows that Venus is the easiest to get to in terms of speed/time.\r\n\r\nFinally they provide ways that space agencies are working on solutions to exploring Mars. For this, the text states 'NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray'.\r\n\r\nThese support the authors' suggestion by showing reasons as to why we should study Venus and the fact that agencies already are researching solutions to exploring Venus.",

In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author's idea is that \"Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.\" How good is he at explaining it? In his article, the author doesn't do well in supporting his idea.\r\n\r\nTo start, the author mostly provides evidence for the counter agrument. The author states, \"it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.\"\r\n\r\nHe also states, \"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\" The entire third paragraph also talks about the disadvantages of pursuiting Venus. In that paragrph he states, \"These conditions are far more extreme than aything humans encounter on Earth.\" This shows that the author doesn't support his idea well because his evidence supports the counter argument.\r\n\r\nThe author's claim is that it is worthy pursuiting Venus, but they can't take further samples because of the risks. The author states, \"More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\" NASA had an idea for sending humans to study Venus, on a blimp-like vehicle. But the conditions aren't easy. According to the article, \"temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.\"",

        "I support the developement of driverless/autonomous cars. Cars have been driven by human drivers so far and accidents are frequent and often violent. If we had autonomous cars, we could almost completely eliminate human error altogether. Autonomous cars would also be more efficient.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars would replace they human driver, who can be sometimes angered by other drivers, distracted by passengers, or get easily lost in new places, with a more logic minded computer. An autonomous car would be safer than a human driven car because a computer program cannot be distracted by its passengers or get angry at someone's poor driving because a computer doesn't think emotionally, but rather logically, making the computer driver safer. Google has been test driving partial-autonomous cars in certain conditions for 7 years and has so far had no crashes.\r\n\r\nAutonomous cars would not only be a safer alternative to human driving, but a more fuel eficient, and therefore, greener alternative. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, autonomous cars would be twice as fuel efficient as today's taxis and buses. With more fuel efficient cars, pollution due to carbon dioxide emmisions will drastically decrease. Fuel efficient cars also help the American economy because if cars are using half as much gasoline, then we only have to import half as much oil, which will save us money as a country.",

They even mentioned in the artilce how the cameras on board of MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face clearly but skeptics a different thing. That pobably aliens makings were being hidden by the haze. Which were not likely it could of been the air,because the human like face was located in the north martian latitude where it was already winter. It could of been the breeze from the snow.\r\n\r\nWho would think that aliens would do that if they knew we were going to spot it evenutly. The picture that was taken in 2001 was more bigger and more proseize on what we would of been looking at then it was in 1976. The picture that was taken in 2001 made people see that there was nothing to worry about and that it was just a rock looking like a face.",

Here are some reasons why.\r\n\r\nThey thought it would be a good way to engage the public by giving the liiusion of eyes,nose,and mouth. They wanted people to be interested and it worked. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and realized it was no alien monument after all. The picture was ten times clearier than the other ones. Skeptics assumed alien markings were hidden by haze. But that's not true. Just like any other landforms it would be hard to see. It's hard work to target cydonia. Whenever they get a chance tot they try to capture it. In 2001 they captured a even better picture. It was like Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shack. But it was really a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. It looks like the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Most peopel didn't believe or want to beieve it. They thought the aliens created it because you could not really see the face. The 1.56 meters,compared to 43 meters per pixel is the best 1976 Viking photo. So whatever they were seeing was an illusion. There's no alien monument on the face so it has to be a landform.",
        "In the article, \"Driving Cars Are Coming\", there should not be a development of driverless cars. Driverless cars can cause so much stress safety wise and court wise. There should not be driverless cars.\r\n\r\nFirst, Driverless cars can cause alot of stress on people and there safety. There is no proof that these cars can handle the main streets and highways, the author explained that these cars have only been tested on tracks that were specially made for these cars when he said,\"General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track.\" Also the people oppurating these cars may get lazy while the car is in motion from just sitting there and might ending up falling asleep, the author described the fact that these cars only alert you when human assistance is needed but what if the driver falls asleep? The author says, \"This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" That is why the cars are not up to standards for safety.\r\n\r\nSecond, Driverless cars can also become a great dibate in the court house. Everyone has different views on who to blame if the car was to get into an accident and the driver or passengers were to be injured.The author says,\"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" Also new laws would have to be made if these cars were to be made and out on the market, because of liability issues.",
        "Do you remember the first day you got your license? I know I do, and now with all the technology they're trying to make cars that drive themselves. Drivless cars would be fun and all, but how are they going to help us? How are they going to hurt us?\r\n\r\nGetting my licese was the best day of my life. I finally knew that I had freedom to go out and drive and have control of what I wanted to do. They're trying to manufacture driveless cars, and I don't see it doing anything but causing problems. There is a lot of responsibility with driving and if this \"Driveless Car\" crashes, who's fault is it? It shouldn't be the drivers fault, and I don't think manufacturerers are going to take the blame for a malfuncton in the car either.\r\n\r\nDriving has never been a real problem in the past for anyone. Yeah there is an occasional wreck or a tragedy, but the only real problem that driving has had is people driving under the influence. If these driveless cars do become a thing, I can see way more people driving under the influence because they don't have to have complete control of the car, then who is responsible for the wreck? The car that is supposed to drive itself, or the impaired driver?\r\n\r\nCar prices have gone up over the last few years, and not just in a slight change. Cars used to be reasonably cheap and now with all the technology the companies are putting in the cars the prices have sky-rocketed. The only thing that this driveless car is going to do is push the prices of vehicles up even more, and some people as it is already can't afford cars.",
        "Some people believe that The Face on Mars was created by aliens. It's good to use your imaginations, but sadly, that wouldn't be the case. Most to even all evidence proves that The Face is simply a natural landform on Mars, similar to natural landforms on Earth. It's a common happening, and the most logical answer.\r\n\r\nUs scientists at NASA have been researching The Face for years. Sure, the first picture of The Face did resemble that of a human face, or an Egyptian Pharaoh as it says in paragraph 2 of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", but since then we've been able to get better, higher-quality pictures that show that what made The Face look like a face was simply shadows. The Face is a landform on Mars, and that's simply it. It's similar to \"landforms common around the American West\", as it states in paragraph twelve, it's the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" here on Earth.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't convince you that it's not aliens that created The Face, hopefully this will. In paragraph 5 of the article on The Face, it states \"Some people think the Face is 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This isn't true. If NASA were to find life on Mars, it would benefit us. We wouldn't have a reason to hide it. As proof, that's also stated in paragraph 5, \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" Now, if defenders of our budget wish that there were ancient civilizations on Mars, don't you think we wouldn't hide it? This shows that it would benefit us if it were that, proving further that aliens aren't the creators of The Face.",

For example, if the teacher says that the students must choose a story to read, but it had to be online, the computer would be able to give a list of suggested stories, and, based on the students facial expression while reading each title, it could give the article that would be the best for that student. If students are interested in a topic, they are most likely to read more and more about it, thus improving their lexile level and reading comprehension.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it could also distract students from their school work. When the students have free time, they will play games, watch videos, etc., while the computer reads the students face while they are doing so.

This shows how Venus is way more extreme and humans wouldn't handle it. NASA have worked on solutions to makimg a mission safe and scientifically productive. Floating above the fray would allow scientist to study Venus the author used an example of a blimp-like vehicle.",
        "Driverless car`s In my opinion are a pretty smart idea for the people who lke to be on there phone while driving and risk theres and others life . Or a person who drinking and can get home safely cause he dont have to drive because the smart car will drive for him to get home. The smart car`s can lower the rate of deaths because of drunk drivers and people who text and drive . The smart car can also help with drives who slowly fall asleep at the wheel so they can take it easy but not fall asleep while driving because if the smart car is driving, but the human driver still has to be alert at all times because they may come across a road that takes human skill driving to go through like work site`s, accident`s,etc . In a negative way they can be a bad idea because what if there is a mechanical malfunction with the car itself like a problem that the owner of the car couldnt fix by hand because it had to be done by machines or experts then you wouldnt have a car for the time being .",

        "There is diffren't arguments about the Face spotted on Mars. Some believe it is an alien artifact, and some believe it is just rocks. I'm here to tell you it it just rocks. So, there is nothing to worry about. If you don't believe me, just keep reading... and you will soon learn it is just your imagination. But some people probably never will learn. Till then, just read this... Maybe I will change your mind if you really believe it is a face. Or maybe I won't. Let's see what you choose.\r\n\r\nFirst, it just your eyes messing with you! Your eyes can play tricks on you and make you see things that are not really there. This is just rocks oddly placed and the rocks have shadows. That it all your seeing. If it were really a so called \"face\" on Mars, that would mean there would have to be life on Mars before. Have they proven life on Mars? They only found traces of water in the past. So, there could have been life on mars, but we haven't found anything besides this Face. Yes, if we found more ''faces'' we could consider it. But, we haven't, and there isnt enough evidence to support it.\r\n\r\nAlso, over the past 25 years... we've seen the Face everywhere in papers.\r\n\r\nThis could all be a scam, people are just trying to get people intrested in Mars more. There is always false advertisment in commercials, news articles, ect. This is just another one of those! We would have found something out in 25 years. And what do you know? Nothing. All there is, is a picture. They even took a picture a second time and still found nothing,said it was just a natural landform.",
        "Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotion would be great for students in a classroom. I am going to give the most outstanding reasons and examples on why this would be excellent for students. Once, I am done you will be able to fully understand my point of view and how it would be great for students in a classroom. Also, be sure to notice the way I verifiy my answer for you to draw the same conclusion as I do. This technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be great. Well because it'll inform teachers on how a student feel about the work, notify if the students have things going own in personally life, and it would decrease the rate of students dropping out of school.\r\n\r\nFirst, it'll inform teachers on how the student feel about the work. For example, \"if you were to give the student work that they don't understand but wouldn't tell you\". Due to the fact of having the computer reading the student expression you will be able to know and find out what is really going on with the student on the subject they are stuck on. Once, you notice that you will be able to help the student out on the things that they are stuck on. Then, the fact of you knowing things about the student revolve around the computer providing information.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it would notify if the student is going through anything in their personal life because of the facial expressions that is being read. For example, \"a student is getting beat at home very badly but choose not to let anyone know\". Then there is the computer that will tell the teacher what is going on and why they are acting the way they do. The Facial Action Coding System will report that the students is holding something in and is showing fake emotions on how they are really feeling. In a way, this would means this type of technology would become literally a life saver. Well because something bad at home can really come to the light and better the student from the things they are going through.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would decrease the rate of student dropping out of school. For example,\"students that are likely to drop out are the ones who keep quiet about them not understanding something\".",
        "In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile' the author is telling us about the FACS\r\n\r\nwhich stands for facial action coding system that can identify human emotions. This technology will be valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. Teachers and students would be able to use this amazing technology in which ever way needed.\r\n\r\nThe FACS technology is an amazing way to determine the emotions of people by reading their muscles of the face or the way ones mouth is moved. In paragraph 6 the author tells us if the student becomes confused about a lesson on the computer, then the computer could read facial expressions then later on modify the lesson so that it becomes more interesting to the student or whoever maybe working on the assignment. This piece of technology would be helpful in my school or in any school because if the students are working on a assignment or test and they get confused maybe the computer could help the students out. In other words, give the students a hint or re word the problem they were struggling on. This system of technology is beyond amazing\r\n\r\nThe FACS system is an effective and amazing piece of technology. The author lists so many ways it can read your facial expressions it is beyond amazing. The system can be helpful in a classroom especially in circumstances where students need extra help or are behind, ths piece of technology would be beyond useful.",

Also, on April 5, 1998, thousands of web users were anxiously waiting for the very first image on a JPL web site, which seemed to reveal that it was actually a natural landform.\r\n\r\nNext, not everyone was happy with the results of it being a natural landform and not created by a alien.

        "Do you think driverless cars are a good idea? Yes or No? Driverless cars can have positive effects and negative effects. The cars could change the world or they could not end well.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are not a good idea at all.\r\n\r\nThe reason is, because the cars really are not fully driverless. if you are in a constrution zone or near an accident the car has you take over. The car isn't full capable of handling driving in a situation like that. The car lets the driver know when they should take over. So the question is \" If the car is driverless how come you have to take over in certain situations\"? Why can't the car handle it all on its own since the car is smart? For the driverless cars to be very smart they need a bunch of sensors.\r\n\r\nMy postion on driverless cars is I think they are a bad idea. They can't fully handle all situations. Also if the person behind the wheel is drunk or worse and they come upon a bad accident \" What will they do\"? \" How will they act\"? Since the car can't handle itself and the driver is incoherent I dont think the ending result will be very good at all.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the driver of the car must stay alert at all times and be ready to take over if needed. If there is an accident or the wiring or technology fails in the car.\r\n\r\n\"",
        "Having a computer that can tell what you are feeling can and can't be a good thing. Like you could be sad or depressed and not want anyone to know but they computer does. It can send information to people and you didn't want those people knowing how you are feeling. This can cause problems in a family because it may tell them something they didn't want to know.\r\n\r\nFirst off some people would rather keep to themselves because sometimes showing their real self can hurt others. You can always fake being happy or fake being interested in something that you aren't, but the computer can figure out how you are really feeling and let people know that you aren't interested in the thing they are talking about or happy that someone is talking to you. It can ruin everything between people. The article states that \"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\" observes Dr. Huang, \"even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression\" (Paragraph 4). This is saying that sometimes people don't put much effort into emotions like for instance smiling, sometimes people don't smile as broadly as they would like to.\r\n\r\nThis is my opinion on being able to have a computer analyze how you are feeling. I think it would be a bad idea and it would be better off to let people keep their feelings to themselves.",

The car caint since every thing like if you are sleep, if there is ice on the ground, and construction zone. When you are sleep which im sure you would end up doing do to the fact you arent realy driven can have some realy bad effects in the future more accident leading to death, and might even get arrested ffor reckless driving.\r\n\r\nAnother reason I am against driverless cars is that it takes away lots of jobs for people. Some people this effects are car dealers, vallet parkers, airport parking,\r\n\r\nand other people whithin car companies. This is a big thing alot people may be homeless if this happens.\r\n\r\nThe last reason I have is that it is a waste of time and money.

        "Have you ever heard about big faces on Mars, NASA has gone on many space trips but this time they found sothing creepy. They had found big faces made in the dust, NASA said they have never heard about anything like this before So that makes me a little scared on how they got there.\r\n\r\nI think that it is scary having planets have faces on them. these Faces were found in 1976 and it was hard to see and in 1998 and in 2001 the face got covered by sand and dust and you couldnt see it anymore. in 1976 there was a group called the Viking 1 sent by NASA. They had found a 2nd face made and it had shadows in its eyes, and mouth.\r\n\r\nThere was a big time when everyone kept talking about these faces in magazines, in social media, and in abandoned stores. \"The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in holltwood films, appered in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery stores.\"(5)\r\n\r\nSome people say that these faces are awesome and that NASA should go on the planet Mars and explore the faces on Mars. This finding was very important to tax payers. NASA had taken many pictures of these faces they even sent another space ship to go with a better camera to take better pictures.\" we felt this was important to taxpayers\", explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NAS's Mars exploration program.\" we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" (6)\r\n\r\nNASA had sent a 3rd space mission in April 5, 1998 when the space ship had passed over Cydonia the took a picture of the face.",
        "Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.\r\n\r\nStrangley, the author of \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\"\r\n\r\nsuggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was \"a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,\" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, \" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\u0097landforms common around the American West.\" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?\r\n\r\nAll in all, there is no \"true\" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature.",
        "The author supports his idea very well in this article. He has so many evidence in each paragraph. He has so many ways to back it up .

He is right on soon were gone have to find or live on a new planet other then earth. Then i agree on\r\n\r\nparagraph 2 he said venus is the closet planet to earth terms of density and sizeand occasionally the closet in distants too. In paragraph 4 it says that astronomers fascinated by venus because futher vists to its surface most earth-like planet in our solar system.\r\n\r\nWhat thing that good about this article is that has alot facts and things i didn't know about venus.

        "What Does it Look Look Like to You\r\n\r\nThe \"Face on Mars\" is just a landform. Like many other NASA scientist i do not beleive that it was an made by ancient civilazations of aliens. The pictures that we have taken from the planet Mars first indicated a type of face. But now that with our newer technology we've seen that it is just a mesa or butte. NASA has even provided real photos taken on the Mars. But still, many disagree that it is simply just a landform.\r\n\r\nNasa sending out the Viking 1 and bringing back that picture has made a big impact on NASA. Alot of scientist did not beleive that it was a face. But \"the Face on Mars\" has become a pop icon. This \"Face on Mars\" starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout linesfor 25 years. But NASA scientist were still a bit doubtfull.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 NASA felt that it was important to tax payers to see the for sure if the \"the Face on Mars\" was really a face at all. When Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural alndform. So all these people believed that it was a face but it actually turned out, from real pictures taken, to be a landform.\r\n\r\nBut still not evryone was content with that. The \"Face on Mars\" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera that took the last picture of the \"Face on Mars\" had to peer through wispy clouds to see the \"Face\".",
        "Simply think of a future in which a computer program is able to adjust itself to the needs of a student, a home-body, anyone, just by looking at their face. Imagine how powerful and monumental a change like that could be. There would be easier design of virtual lessons to individualize to each student, there's home computer use, such as playing calming music when the computer detects stress, and then there's better facial representation in things such as movies or video games, as our understanding of the expression of emotion and emotion itself grows. Although there are some concerns regarding it, the Facial Action Coding System can be slightly modified at worst if such concerns are not settled, and there are plenty of solution and measures to unwarrant such concerns.\r\n\r\nIn order for the a student to successfully learn through a lecture or a class, the number one way to ensure their overall growth as a student is maintain their engagement in whatever activity they're partaking in. One way virtual classes can become more interactive and individualized from person to person is with the Facial Action Coding System, a system that's capable of reading a person emotion through a complex algorithm and outputting a near exact description of their emotion. This kind of program could create a whole new level of interactivity in lessons by allowing a computer to be able to detect whether the student is engaged or bored, and adjusting the lesson accordingly.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but such a technology would also lead the way into a whole new level of interaction between computers and their users. For example, the Facial Action Coding System could lead the way in paving a path to more support from a computer. For instance, the use of such a program could allow a computer to detect the users emotion and be able to compensate or assist in stabilizing it, such as playing calming music when it detects its user is getting too stressed.",

It sounds pretty cool.\r\n\r\nProf. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe helped developed a way for you to know.

The new technology will help the teacher know how your feeling about the whole situation.\r\n\r\nThe teacher might push the assignment back for you because he/she knows your not feeling the day and they know it will only stress you out. I think the technology is a good advantage to have in classrooms. Teachers can know how the students feel about an activity or a project. The teachers might think its fun but the students might feel like its boring. If a student does not like a project, they dont put in as much effort.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 6 it states,\"a Web ad appears do your screen, a similar ad might follow.

        "Do you believe that Smart Cars are positive or negative to aspects of driverles cars? Some people believe that Smart Cars are a negative because was if something happens to the technology who is going to be responsbile the driver or the manufacturer. Although ,I would have to say Smart Cars are a postive, because the Smart Cars would have sensors, and speeds up to 25 miles per hour, and the Smart Car is controlled by technology so the car can control itself through accidents , break itself, amd through work zones. Adding to that, the Smart Car lets you know when there is a problem accuring and it gets your attention.\r\n\r\nFirst, Smart Cars are a postive aspect to driverless cars because the cars would have sensors. The sensors would monitor the surrounding of the Smart Car. In the aricle its says,\" auto makers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock breakes. With in 10 years, those sensor have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-controll skids or rollovers\". The sensors are placed everywhere aound the car such as:on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, and 4 automatic radar sensors etc. Meanwhile, those are just some of the places.\r\n\r\nNext, the Smart Cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. In the article it says, \" But special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In facts, non of the cars developed so far one completetely driverless. With that being said, the Smart Car isn't completely driverless, the driver is still driving just not the entire time. The driver is needed when pulling in or out of a driveway. Also when there is an accident or a problem.\r\n\r\nThen,since the Smart Cars are controlled by technology, the car can control itself through accidents,break itself, and throught work zones.",

And a car without an alert driver isnt a safe car, at least not in law makers eyes.\r\n\r\nIn states like California, Nevada, Florida, and the district of columbia it is illegal to test computer driven cars. The rest of america should follow suit though the article says, \" manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe.\" For the time being there not safe enough. though there are constant development being made to the driverless car. There are still to many hole in the ideal to make a safe apperance on the road.\r\n\r\none of the advancements is that the cars have \"Traffic Jam Asstancet.\" the article say they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\"",

Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ,\" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.\r\n\r\nSome might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century. Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters, 43 in the 1976 Viking photo. This tells everyone that they did not make their decsion based upon 20th century technology, but they captured thier photo with morden day technology.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I belive that \"The Face\" was a just a natural landform.",
        "People today and years before us have always wandered if there has been life on Mars. With one photo taken of a mysterious figure, people think they have come closer than ever to knowing if there was life long before us on another planet. \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" is a topic commonly talked about. Some say the Face was created by aliens, while others say it is the natural landform that caused it. Pictures were taken, and a conclusion have been made whether or not aliens created it, or if it was caused by a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, Viking 1 was orbiting Mars to find a landing space for their sister ship, Viking 2.\r\n\r\nWhile scouting out Mars, Viking 1 comes across an image that could likely show life on Mars. The pictured appeared to be a face, but was debated for a long time. A couple years later in 1998, the Mars Global surveyor (MGS) took a shot of the \"Face\" which revealied a naural landform.\r\n\r\nThe image shot in 1998 was ten times shaper and more clear than the one taken in 1976. Once the second picture was taken, it was released to the JPL web site showing all, that it was caused by natural landforms and that aliens were not the case. People began to say that the aliens were hidden by a haze since the camera it was taken with had to zoom through the clouds in order to take the shot.",
        "In 1976, NASA was taking pictures of Mars and found what looked like a human face looking at them. When the news got to the public they emediatly jumped to the conclution that it was an alian artifact. I can reasure you that it is nothing more than a natural landform that looks like a face.\r\n\r\nWhen NASA went back to retake pictures on April 5,1998, it showed that there was nothing at all but a nautral landform. The public still were not agreeing on it just being a landform due to them taking the pictures on a cloudy winter day.",

The article said it took about two weeks to get across the pacific ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to China. That's like sitting in vomet for a month.\r\n\r\nWhat would you have to eat every day. You can't keep food on a boat for a month. The boat would only be filled with food.

With driverless cars you never know when your going to have a accident or loose control of the car. I know I would like to have full control of the car that I am driving, not some robot car.

Some electrical difficulties could happen and you have your kid in the car how are you suppose to save the both of you. There is some many things that could go wrong and i think its just a way to big of a risk to take.These experiments on these andvances cars are unnessecary when we have perfectly fine cars today.

        "25 years ago NASA discovered a face on Cydonia, Mars. It was extrodinary looking like an egyptian face! Many people think it was a human face that aliens created, but surely enough it isn't. As a scientist from NASA I know for sure it is definitely not. NASA went into further detail with this \"Face\". We looked further into the face just to show people that this is not a face created by aliens.\r\n\r\nFurther more we found it was just another Martian mesa, common in Cydonia. Since the face was becoming popular, being in movies, magazines, radio shows, and books we had to prove that we are right. As a result in 2001 NASA took a even closer and more clear picture of this face on Cydonia. It showed that it was just illusions making the mesa look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Making this mesa look like a face. This revealed to all people that this face is just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion NASA knows more than just typical average day people. NASA has proved us wrong from thinking it is a face created by aliens.",

I am about to tell a few reasons you should do it. Here are some If you like animals, if you like exploring, if you want money, and even if you like to try new things, this would be a great thing for you.\r\n\r\nthe first reason is if like animals you would love this job. We take care of cattle. You get to feed them, brush them, clean their stall, and even lead them off the boat. You have to take care of almost 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them.\r\n\r\nAlso if you like to explore the world around you this would be a good opportunity to do so. We have visited Europe, China, and other places. I seen the Acropolis in Greece, I took a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the panama Canal on my way to China. There are some other reasons to join the program.",
        "Personally, I think that \"driverless\" cars are and would be extremely dangerous. They can't react to quick events as fast as a human can. They aren't even fully \"driverless\" to begin with, a person in the car would still have to be ready at all times in the occasion that something happens. The company or companies technology operating the car to drive automatically could malfunction and or crash at any given time while a person or people are in the vehicle. The main reasons why I don't support driverless cars are because they create an unsafe area and passengers could get too disracted on phones or devices.\r\n\r\nThe first reason why I don't support driverless cars are because they create an unsafe area for people. I say this because if Google or another company was supporting that over a car, if wouldn't be able to adapt to an area if an accident or something of that nature happpened. Weather might play an important factor on why this system may not be at it's best performance level.",
        "I cant imagine a life or a point in time where in the future people could be driving driverless cars. Can you? I thinks its okay if some people who need help driving uses them or might own one, but for everyone? Not exactly how I see the world becoming better for everyone because of that. The world evolves in many ways with transportation already now in numerous ways. The bike lanes are everywhere, people run, walk, or jog places, theres Uber thats now pretty big. But why a driverless car? So now people can become so lazy they barley have to drive? From the age where your remembering to be in a car you cant wait to be the next person to be able to drive thats somehing I & many others agree shouldnt be taken away.\r\n\r\nA driverless car seems very possible within the next few years but I dont see any reasoning behind the fact that we dont need it. Maybe for older folks who have trouble or someone having so much money for one they just get one for the fact that they want to say that they have it. Also technicaly it's not even a \"driverless\" car. You still have to be awake, aware, & control it through tough spots like a car crash, & road work.\r\n\r\nIf your in a age where your getting a permit or you already have one dont you think when you was younger, before all that, that you couldnt wait to get your car & licaens. You would think of driving somewhere with someone if you prefer that out to eat or to a store littlle things that make you feel like you accomplished something. You'd miss it right? So why have a company tell you dont have that excitment for being a legal driver & showing you can do things, & share thier dream of just being able to sit in the car for however long with who ever your with just to sit there?",
        "The Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, could be useful for school purposes, and may help students and teachers tremendously. On the otherhand, however, it is not perfect and may cause more issues than it solves.\r\n\r\nFor school purposes, the FACS can be used to alter an online course, assessment, or even just a simple knowledge check, using facial expressions to determine if the students are confused, bored, or if they understand it. If they are confused, it may be altered to help them understand whatever it is they're working on. For someone who is bored, it may try to make an online course more interesting to grasp their attention.\r\n\r\nHowever, the FACS is not perfect. It may mistake a facial expression for the wrong emotion. This could result in issues involving altering an online assessment, or course. Some students may feign emotions, and make faces to do the easier course that's meant for students who require additional help. Also, students who take an online course may be confused about something else, not the course they're taking. The FACS will still read that expression as confusion and alter it because of that confusion.",
        "Have you ever wanted to travel or see new places that normally others wouldn't have the opportunity to go see? Me, being in the Seagoing Cowboys program reccomend you to join for three reasons. By participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will be able to see unique places that some people might not have the opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nAnd so to start, I get that some people don't want to go out, or maybe they already travel the world - but, I will promise you, it's worth seeing. Some of the unique places include, well, water! Most of the trips you might be taking is going to be focused on water, and by saying that, I just hope that you may be at least a bit intrested in joining at this point. This will prove, that be joining, you will see new and unique places.\r\n\r\nSecondly, another reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it's loads of fun. Feeding the animals may be a hard task, but it sure frees you form some of the bordom on the boat or ship. Yes, some people don't like animals, and I get that, but it doesn't mean that they won't have even a bit of fun, there's so much more for you to explore if you just look! You can go and kill some time with the animals, and feed them when needed. At night, if you're assigned to the animals, you have to go check on them every hour. It really does seem like alot, but I don't think that anybody would want an animal, or animals, around the ship lurking around, messing up peoples things.",

        "Many people believe technology is becoming too advanced for our own good. Maybe they were right, technology is advancing at a rapid rate and can also invade one's privacy. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author describes a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions such as happy, sad, disgust, surprised, and a few other basic emotions. There is debate whether this software should become avaible in classrooms for students and if it is valuable. It is not very valuable, it is an invasion of privacy to use this software to read a students' emotional responses to their work.\r\n\r\nSchools around the world are becoming more and more advanced everyday. Students, freshman through seniors, at Floyd Central High School along with hundreds of tother high schools have ipads that students carry around and use in their everyday classes. If they were to have this new software it would not change very many things. \"For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different.\" What does web ads have to do with a student's education? This only shows that students will be recorded at all times through their ipads and/or computers while they do their school work. This is a huge invasion of privacy to students everywhere who might have to use this new emotional expression software.\r\n\r\nThe article states, \" \"A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr Huang predicts.\"Then it could modify the lesson, like the effective human instructor.\" \" Though it sounds like a step towards the right direction in technology, students will be just as bored doing random classwork on a computer without emotion software watching their every move through a camera. Also, at least 60% of students do better with a teacher in front of them to help rather than learning things online. If this software acts as a effective human instructor, students will still grow confused because as the article states that \"...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.\".",
        "Some people believed that the \"Face on Mars\" was an alien monument, and still do. This was a conspiracy theory that had been proven wrong many times by us scientists at NASA. When we first discovered this face, there was a degree of surprise among the mission controllers. But they soon figured it was another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Only this one had different shadows that gave the appearance of an Egyption Pharaoh, which caused the theories of it being an extra terrestrial monument.\r\n\r\nWhen we had unveiled the photograph of the rock formation out into the public, it had been captioned that it was a \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" This had been done to attract attention, and it did. People began to think the Face was evidence of life on Mars that NASA would rather hide. But, our NASA budgeters wish there was life on Mars because it would benefit our investigations and bring in more money. NASA would have abosolutely no reason to hide this information from the public.\r\n\r\nYet, theorists are unconvinced. On April 5, 1998, we sent the Mars Global Surveyor to fly over Cydonia and to take photographs that were ten times sharper than the original photos. We first uploaded these images onto a JPL website, explaining that the Face was a natural landform and that it was not a monument built by aliens.\r\n\r\nPeople were still not satisfied with our information at this point. Our mission controllers prepared to inspect the Face again. This time, our controllers used a camera that spanned 1.56 meters on the maximum resolution, which captured a breath-taking image. This image shows that the Face is an equivalent of a butte or mesa. This is a common landform on Earth, and proves that the Face on Mars is just an oddly shaped area of land.\r\n\r\nI do understand why people may have thought that this landform was evidence of life on Mars, but us workers at NASA gave real evidence that it wasn't.",
        "Driverless Cars and Their Risks\r\n\r\nThe concept of driverless cars, does not appeal to me whatsoever. I do not agree with the manufactoring of these cars because I do not find the concept of a driverless car to be safe. Trusting technology with something as important as driving, is nothing short of dangerous. Think of it this way, do you know that feeling of when your computer freezes? Or when your television goes out? T.V.'s and computers are some of the basic essentials of technology. They have their bugs, and they do not run flawlessly 24/7. Driverless cars can be the same way too. They can freeze and have their bugs. Are you willing to risk you and your loved ones lives with a driverless car?\r\n\r\nI certainly wouldn't and by the end of this eassy, I hope you won't risk it either.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars have been fantasized for many years. Google employees such as Sergey Brin and Sebastian Thrun claim that this fantasy is close to becoming a reality. I, for one haven't really heard any news on the matter. Sure, the rumors were there, but I honestly haven't heard of any of these breakthroughs. I don't trust it. I, and many other people want to see true facts and real results. The fantasy of driverless cars clouds people's judgement and so with such little public attention and news coverage, I honestly can see why me and so many others are skeptical of this idea.\r\n\r\nStates like California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia, have outlawed these cars. They believe that having a human driver is the safest and smartest way to drive a car. And their right.\r\n\r\nTechnology is nothing short of unpredictable, as anything can happen. A phone can shut down, a computer can catch a virus, and a T.V. can blow out. Who knows what a driverless car can do? At least if a car breaks down, the human driver has some degree of control over the matter.",
        "My point on driverless cars, I would not like to see them on the road because they can cause accidents or injuries/death. Also, they can cause serious complications on someone's life if they were injured by the driverless car.\r\n\r\nThey don't have the quick response like humans do when they drive, plus if they are on the road when its slick and they don't know to be slow when on slick roads they can cause accidents. The question would be if the driverless cars were to get into an accident, whose fault would it be? If the human driver didn't cause it should the company get fault for it and even get sued? Or should the human driver take the blame since they are human and actually driving a car. The company who manufactured the car should take full responsibily with the accident. The driverless cars could malfunction and cause a serious or life-threatening car crash to the human driver on the other side of the rucus. Many people don't want driverless cars on the road so people won't get hurt first off, and secondly they don't want them on the road so they won't mess up and cause harm. Although the driverless cars have humans on standby, they still shouldn't be made because of all the safety hazards it could cause on the other people and the technology that was built into the car, its essentially a waste of money to make a car thats driverless and it gets wrecked beyond repair.",
        "The \"Evening Star\" or otherwise known as Venus is a very dangerous planet. Despite the planet being close to us, we haven't sent any spacecrafts there in the past 30 years. The reason has alot to do with the fact that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus\u0092s atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOn the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which means that its alot of times hotter than the surface of our planet. The atmospheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, why would we want to go back there.\r\n\r\nThe reason is because Astronomers think that the Venus was once an earth like planet. They believe that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Adding more into this is that today, Venus has some features such as mountains and valleys.\r\n\r\nNASA has come up with an idea on how they would live in\r\n\r\nVenus safely and productive. The idea is to allow scientist to float above ground. About 30 miles to be exact. With them hovering 30 miles above ground they should be safe from the ground conditions. With that, NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus; such as an device that was used in World War 2 that calculates under high pressure of heat and does not require electricity.",

One example of this is that the car could malfuction its self while driving automatically. In the article it nevers explain what the car would do in a car accident or even when damaged.

What if the driverless car so happenes to malfinction? The possiblities are endless when it comes to the things that could go wrong, when it comes to driverless cars.\r\n\r\nIf you think you are prepared for driving then I think you should know all the tasks you have to do and be able to perform them tasks while driving. The person driving should be responsible and be very aware of his surrounding, and they should always be alert. If you think you should be driving then you have to be responsible for yourself and the others around you. Not only is your life on the line so is theirs. You shouldnt have to rely on electronics and computers to help you drive. That may also make you forget about the rules of driving.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I think it would be awesome if we didn't have to drive ourselves around.",
        "Twenty Five years ago, something oddly strange happend on Mars. The NASA spacecraft, Viking 1 had caught a photo on the red planet that had a very strong identical look to a human face. Many scientist thought it was the work of aliens but here are some facts to prove that this theory is incorrect. Through the process of movie films, books and other things people used to explain this phenonmean, and through scientifical evidence.\r\n\r\nWhen the news spread about the strange human face on Mars, many people became interested in the fact that aliens could have been responsibel for this event. To surpise the face on Mars has become a popular icon, with many Hollywoodfilms, books, magazines, and even talk shows. This greatly increased the number people going with the idea that aliens could be the cause of this but this idea is false. In the atricle \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", it talks about on April 5,1998 that the Mars Global Surveyor was launched over Mars to check the so called alien monument. While using the Mars Orbiter Camera, Micheal Malin and his crew used his ten time sharp vision to scan the \"alien monument\" and found out it was just a natural lanform.\r\n\r\nEven though the scince had proved that the strange face on Mars was just a landform, not alot of people were convinced. However, Science once agian came out to prove once and for all that it was indeed a landform.

        "Venus is the second planet from our sun, and it is periodically referred to as earth's twin. Both planets have the same size and density, but the similarities stop there. The atmosphere of Venus consists of 97% carbon doxide, clouds of sulfuric acid, and the hottest surface temperetue of any planet orbitting the sun. Despite this, scientists have tried to send unmanned spacecrafts to the surface of Venus. Scientists think that Venus may have been the most earthlike planet, with the planets surface like valleys and mountains and possible evidence of oceans that may have existed long ago. The author believes that it is worthy to continue trying to explore Venus despite its dangers.\r\n\r\nThe author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining the similarities that Venus has with the Earth and indicating that Venus is the closest planet to the Earth. In the text it states, \"...Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" This quote supports my claim because the author gives some evidence that Venus had some sort of body of water. The author might believe that Veus can be habitable. Another piece of information supporting my claim states, \" ...recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.\"",
        "Driverless cars have both positve and negatives aspects, but I personally do not think that we should have them on our streets. They are too complicated for people. I do not think they will ever actually be on the street because of how dangerous they are. Multiple states have already outlawed the testing of driverless cars. I am siding with those states because, driverless cars are dangerous, they will make people even lazier then what they already are, and a lot of people probably would not be able to afford these cars.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are dangerous because everything is controlled by a computer, the passenger is not in control at all times. Traffic laws state that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. If there is a passenger in a driverless car, and the car begins to malfunction and the passenger gets injured or even dies, whose fault will it be? The passenger or the manufacturer?\r\n\r\nDriverless cars just make things so much more complicated, I think most people would rather drive their own cars anyways, because they will feel as if they are control of everything, rather than having a computer control everything for you.\r\n\r\nAnother reason driverless cars are bad is because they will make America even lazier then it already is today. People in this country do not like doing anything for themselves, driverless cars will just make everything even worse. If people do not have to drive, then they will act as if they do not have to do other things. Not having to drive just leads to more and more lazy actions down the road. I think their are certain things that people will always need to do for themselves, and driving is one of them.\r\n\r\nCars that are controlled manually are already expensive enough. I can only imagine how expensive driverless cars will be.",
        "The author supports this idea by introducing us to the planet and stating key points about Venus early on in the passage. In paragraph one he says, \"In our solar system Venus is the second planet from our sun.\" and that's showing us that the author is intrested in studying Venus. In paragraph two he begins to talk about the different speeds in which Venus, Earth and Mars travel. The author states in the third sentence of paragraph two, \"These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus\".\r\n\r\nAs the author states in the third paragragraph, \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...\" Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author has to be fully intrested in Venus to know this much about the planet. You will learn that Venus is a dangerous planet and not even metal can survive on Venus's surface. The author states in paragraph two, \"Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades\". Venus is so dangerous that in order to visit the planet you can't even land, you would have to float about 30 miles from the ground.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Venus is not impossible to visit in fact NASA is still working on getting astronauts there with different approaches.",
        "\"Unmasking the Face on Mars\"\r\n\r\nThe article On the Face on Mars is very interesting, states facts,and some opinions. When the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling then planet Mars it was takikng photographs forl posiible landing sites for Viking 2 spacecraft. But when doing its job itk discovered something unusaul and different about the red planet. What the spacecraft dikscovered that was so\r\n\r\nmysterious to NASA scientist was an enormous face structure neaerly two miles from end to end. Many of some people who work for NASA say it was just another Martian mesa that was common on Mars. Could this be a natural landform or a sign form of another life form.\r\n\r\nBut this stuctuer or landform had Shadows that made it look like an Eygyptian Phharoah. Days later NASA revealed the photograph and the caption read \"huge rock formation...wich resembles a human head...formed by a shwdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Others say that the face was built or made by another life form. But others are wrong, because there are many ways this landform couldve been built by natural land.",
        "Technology is so amazing nowadays. Imagine a technology that could tell your emotion...well, it is a thing. The technology that can see and detect your emotion, it is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology could be very useful in some situations. Professer Thomas Huang is the inventer behind this magnificent technology, also with the help of Professer Nicu Sebe. Professer Thomas and his colleague are very brilliant and are coming up with better ways for computers to be even more smart. This technology may even be useful in classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe Facial Action Coding system can tell your emotions. It all starts when the computer comes up with a 3-D model of the face it will be indentifying the emotion for, it will look at the 44 biggest, and most useful muscles of the face, any movemnt of any muscle can show how you are feeling and the emotion you have. The muscle called frontalis pars lateralis, is the muscle that moves and does the most when you have an excited or suprised emotion. The muscle called the orbicularis oris is the muscle around your mouth that tightens when you are angered.\r\n\r\nThe Facial Action Coding System can detect all emotions. If you are happy, sad, angry, suprised, disgusted, or in a state of fear, the Facial Action Coding system can detect the emotion. The image may not always show a singe emotion, the model being shown could be happy, but still could be in fear of something, the technology will detect it. The technology can detect a single emotion, yet it can detect weather an image has a mixed emotion.\r\n\r\nThe Mona Lisa picture is a good example to use explaining this technology.",
        "I think that it is good that smart cars are being made because say if someone is paying attention to the road and doing something with there child like giving there baby a toy or something and there eyes are off the road then nothing is there to help stop the car. A smart car is a good thing to have because it will most likely lower the amount of crashes that happen even year and even drop the death rate per year. So i think smart cars are a good idea because say if your having a hard time parking your car then the car can do it for you? If someone is drinking and driving or texting and driving then that car can save someones from causing a death or injury.",
        "The invention of this new device could be helpful in many ways. I believe it could help with studies done on students and how they react to certain activities done online or in class and what emotions are expressed in general. It could also help with preventative measures in children and students that are depressed and can be helped. This new technology is useful and helpful in so many ways. Not only could this new technology be used as a facial decoding system, it could be used to tell what the students emotional status is.\r\n\r\nAs i said before the Facial Action Coding System could not only be used for study on students but on babies and adults. This device could help with disabled children and adults, children with birth defects and syndromes. It could help them with gaining knowlegde in emotions and how to tell when someone is mad, sad, etc. , maybe even how to properly show emotions.\r\n\r\nBack to the idea of reading student's facial expressions, it can be helpful in finding ways to make learning more fun for students and ways to make certain activities easier.

However, advanced technology has caused many problems, as it has also been effective.\r\n\r\nThere are certain things \"man\" should control themselves; automotives is one. Yes, a assemly line is much more easier than carrying heavy things to where they need to be, but completely removing a person from an object that can easily end a life is not only lazy, but abserb. Us as humans were given one specifc thing that seperates us from everything else; a brain.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the prompt, if an accident occurs, who will be held responsible?

The car may have an overide system, but a human will not be able to react quick enough in that split second in the chaos that the robot has created.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain things robots will thrive in that humans don't. For instance, a \"whiskey throttle\". This is when a human panics and gets a heavy foot, which causes an accident that was not intended. Robots do not panic, therefore, they will not rear-end the car ahead of them.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\"\r\n\r\nmay look like an alien has constructed it but the shadows of the bumps make it seem like it is an actual human face. If it were aliens who had built the Face on Mars, wouldn't there be more? The answer to that question would\r\n\r\nbe yes. The pictures from 2001 show that that the artifact was really just a natural creation. Before scientists had found the Face on Mars, the question is...just how old is it?\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the aricle it states,\"New high-resolution images and 3D alimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa\" (UTFONM, 1). Thus meaning that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. Before the pictures in 1976 and 98' were awful quality, the picture in 2001 shows exactly what the Face on Mars is. The article also stated that the Face on Mars,\"...huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by the shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth\" (UTFONM, 1). This is proof of it only being a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIf aliens had created this form, wouldn't there be more of these human looking landforms. There is no evidence in the article that states aliens were the creatures who made the Face on Mars. If the Face on Mars was created by aliens, NASA would have wanted to research it instead of hiding it because they would've gotten paid. According to the article it states, \" Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" (UTFONM, 1). It would have been beneficial to NASA if it were made by aliens.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to infer that it could only be a structure made by aliens because who knows the capabilities of these creatures.",

The man continues to argue with me and say that aliens are real and this alien artifact looks like a human face. I have to keep telling him that this is just a natural landform which is called a butte or mesa. This certain mesa looks like a face only because it shows most of the characteristics that a human has such as; the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth which are all just formed by shadows. The man asked how does NASA know that this rock formation that you \"supposedly\" think, is a mesa? He just thinks that it's a sign of aliens. I tell him that Nasa was able to figure it out because a mesa is a a big rock formation that just has a flat top and thats what the face looked like if you see it up close. He still did not believe me. I told him we will find out and we did.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 2001, our team NASA (including me), got a clear picture of this \"face\". The Mars Global Surveyor went just close enough for a look at the Face which was the perfect cloudless day. NASA was able to get a picture many times more clearer than the 1976 Viking photo.\r\n\r\nMany people who thought that the \"face\" was an alien artifact were waiting to see Nasa release how the picture looks like.",
        "Many companys out there are striving for driverless cars. It's an innovation that has been predicted for decades. There is, however, some problems that can occur with the automated car. Most people would think of this as an argument of if A.I. should drive, or if humans should, but I believe it's more like an argument between the human error or the limited thought capacity of a computer.\r\n\r\nThe thought of automated control has been thrown around in many subjects such as border control turrets to androids. It's also been a popular science fiction subject for movies like The Matrix and iRobot. In both of those movies, the A.I. takes control over humanity. If certain disasters were to happen, the A.I. wouldn't know what to do while a human could.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the automated car could save lifes. Many people each year die in car crashes, and alot of those crashes are drunk/distracted drivers. In an automated car, the human could be drunk and the car's performance wouldn't be affected. If only the human couldn't drive the car, nobody would be able to speed, or get in car chases. Car related deaths would go down for sure.",

And also scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact. I know this because in the article it states, \"The caption noted a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" This shows that there is no alien activity on Mars and that there's just shadows that forms the human shaped head.\r\n\r\nTwenty five years ago NASA found a human shaped head on the planet of Mars.

        "Driverless cars would be a huge problem honestly. if they crash who will pay for the damages done? they also wouldnt be cheap to build.\r\n\r\nFirst off they would be dangerous, because we already have drivers that go above the speed limit. now if we had driverless cars and this person could some how go really fast and he isnt paying attention to the road there will be a car crash. another thing some people still text while driving so their eyes wont be on the road it will be on their phone and then an accident could happen.\r\n\r\nBuilding these driverless cars will obviously take alot of money to build cause of all the extra parts that will be need to keep them on the road. they would also be sold at a really high price as well because who wouldnt want a car that could drive on its own.\r\n\r\nHumans would be more efficent at driving then the car driving alone. maybe the censor that keeps the car on the road goes out or anything could happen to the technoolgy in the car that is keeping the car going could mess up and result in a accident.\r\n\r\nWho would be paying for the accidents?",
        "These driverless cars should not be developed becuase technology can crash, safety concerns and lack of knowledge. These 3 reasons all tie up to each other on why these cars should not be developed.\r\n\r\nFirst reason why driverless cars should not be developed is becuase technology is not one hundred percent reliable. Technology can crash causing these cars to possibly not be functioning well which could lead to various accedents and who will take initiative for those damages? \u00a8If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\u00a8 paragraph 9. With this being said anyone can buy things that make their life easier, thats what everyone wants right? Not just becuase it makes your life easier means its safe.\r\n\r\nSecond, these cars should not be developed becuase of safety concerns. As already mentioned technology can crash leading to serious injuries, the sensors could stop working leaving huge possibilities of many crashes. Does this also mean that if these cars replace actual cars does that mean people will become lazier and or not be requiered to drive or have a liscence if indeed this project becomes successful?\r\n\r\nLastly, these cars should not be developed because of lack of knowledge. Again, if these cars replace driver cars does that mean people will become lazier, and or not be requiered to have a liscence if this porject indeed becomes successful?

Many believe it's an alien monument, many believe it's a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIt has been proven that the Face is a natural landform, but not everyone seems to agree. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equilvalent of a buttle or mesa, which are common landforms around the American West. Also, there are no scientific facts that aliens are real. Conspiracy theories lack credability. They question NASA, and conpiracy theorists believe that NASA is trying to hide something from them. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times shaper than the Viking photos.

It is a photo of small region of mars with a couple of formations. But one formation sticks out like a tall man in an elementary school. This picture was taken at the right angle at the right time. It makes it look a face with the angle and shadows. And many people believed it to be a monument made by extratellestular figures. Another reason why they believe for it to be made from aliens is because, \u00a8What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\u00a8\r\n\r\nTheir is a lot of people that would disagree with belief of this face being real. They would believe this way because they would it\u00b4s childish to believe that a rock formation on a foreign planet could ever possibly be made by aliens. Another reason why is because if it does resemble a earth-like formation that was not man made, that means the face was made by aliens, it was just an act of nature. It is physically challenging to make a formation, the shape of a human face, on a planet way far away from its neighboring planets.",

In paragraph seven where it says all the information it says \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is actually not a face but a natural landform for the following reasons, the facial features are just shadows, there isn't any real proof that aliens created it, and scientists have research that is proof of it not being alien-made.\r\n\r\nThe first reason is the facial features are just shadows. It would be nice if it was actually nad by an alien. Sadly, it isn't true. It is proven that it is actually just a huge rock formation. (Paragraph 3) \"The authors reasoned it would be good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. (Paragraph 3)\r\n\r\nSecondly, there isn't actual proof that aliens created it anyways. There isn't any proof that aliens are even completely real. It is said in the article \"Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" (Paragraph 8). So, they do not have any actual real proof.\r\n\r\nMy last reason is that scientists have done research to prove that aliens did not really creat this face in Mars. Scientists had seen this photeo in the winter of April '98. Someone would have to peer through the camera through wispy clouds. (paragraph 8).\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for believing aliens did it is that people want to believe. They want to believe that another race of people can exsist. Maybe the aliens are jsut sending a message that they are real. Wem will never really know for sure sadly.\r\n\r\nYou can belioeve what you would like to.

If the cars computer was to brake down u cant use it at all but with a normal car you can replace cars and have it working again.\r\n\r\nThe last thing i think it would be alot saffer and have faster moving traffic and going to places faster if we didnt have the driverless cars.",

They also say things like \"Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere,\" and \"the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet,\" basically emphasizing that Venus would be almost impossible to explore because of the extreme harsh conditions on the planet.\r\n\r\nFirst off, in paragraph 3 the author writes \"Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" This is the author suming up how impossible it would be to travel there with the technology scientists have today. They even state \"such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans.\" By saying this they are even supporting the fact that scientists can't get there with the technology they have now.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the only support the author has for even traveling to Venus in the first place, is that it is closely related to the planet Earth having features like valleys and mountains. In paragraph 4 he writes \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" So basically the only reason we should spend the billions of dollars it would take to travel there, is because it is somewhat similar to our planet. The only other support the author has for traveling there is the point that it is the closest planet for planetary visit.

The first thing that you have wrong is that the Face seen on Mars is of alien orgin. The Face that you see in the picture is just an oddly shaped Martian mesa. In fact there are very common on that region of Mars so for all we know there could very well be more oddly shaped mesas in that area.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that you miss read the caption of the picture or didn't even look at it at all. If you would've you should have seen the caption stating that the reason it resembles a human head is because of the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The only reason the let people see that photo is because they wanted more people to be intrested more in Mars.\r\n\r\nPlus on April 5, 1998 NASA reaveled to everyone on their website the Face was mearly an oddly shapped Natural landform.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion there are several ways that we could disprove your statement. The first being that it is just a mesa which dosen't have a distinct form, which means that if another one forms it could very well be a dog or a cat. The second being that you may have just miss read or not have read the caption.",

Landforms such as this exist on Earth and high-quality images have been taken showing a normal landform on the surface of Mars.\r\n\r\nOne reason we know the Face was not created by aliens is because of it's similarities to landforms on earth. The Face is \"the Martian equivalent\" of landforms common to the American West called mesas. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, commented on the similarities. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" The fact that the Face resembles a natural landform here on Earth supports the idea of the Face also being a natural landform.\r\n\r\nNot only does the Face have similarities to natural landforms on Earth, higher quality pictures of it have been taken since 1976. In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia where the Face was located. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team \"snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original image\". The photo was uploaded to a JPL web site where thousands were waiting for a picture. A natural landform was revealed. \"There was no alien monument after all\".\r\n\r\nSome people, however, were not convinced. \"Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by a haze.\" People believed the clouds had blocked the view of \"alien markings\". In 2001, on a \"cloudless summer day\".",
        "In this writing prompt I will be supporting the authors argument. The author belives that Venus should be explored and belives exploring Venus would bring plentiful information that could help the world learn more about other plantes and ours. But for this to be an arguemnt there must be a danger or bad factor, the bad harmful factor is the dangers on Venus. Venus has many dangers that has harmed unmanned spacecrafts. More dangers will be explained further in the prompt.\r\n\r\nVenus is often called Earths twin, Venus is the planet that is most related to earth in terms of density and size. But Venus has many more dangers than Earth. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide wich means humans will not be able to breath the air. Venus's surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than earths pressure. Because of the extremely high amount of pressure that would crush a submarine and melt any metal humans would nto be caple of landing on the surface of Venus without being crushed. And not only does Venus have very high tempertures, pressure and a deadly atmosphere, it also has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.\r\n\r\nSo why would we want to explore Venus if it is so inhospitable? Venus may have once had been like earth, with oceans and lifeforms. Venus does have a rocky surface with valleys, moutains and craters. Venus could be the human races next planet to inhabit if an incident would occur to Earth. Venus is the planet that is most like earth with its terrain and possible past life and water. Although Venus has its deadly dangers to humans, scientists are creating ways for humans to explore Venus and learn about this twin planet.\r\n\r\n\" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\"",
        "Luke had no idea that his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.\r\n\r\nIn 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.\r\n\r\nIt took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.\r\n\r\nBeing a Seagoing cow was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. \"Im grateful for the opportunity,\"he says. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion Luke had the best time of his life being a Seagoing Cowboy he didn't no his life would change so soon after his high school graduation.",

But Venus's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees, it is 90 times greater than what we experience on the Earth. I don't think we could live there.But NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, not easy comditions, but survivale for humans.\r\n\r\nAuthor saids strining to meet challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becaus human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

In 1945 they recieved there orders to New Orleans and they arrived August 14, 1945. Eventually, they headed to Greece with 335 horses also with eniugh hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned the age 18 before arriving to greece which meant he could be ready to participate for military service. When they learned he was on a cattle boat they told me to keep doing what I was doing. Luke had made 9 trips, more than any Seagoing Cowboy ever. It was an amazing opportunity for Luke, he loved visiting ancient things. Luke didn't just have to me stuck in a boat with horses he got to also go out and adventure. It took 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean, from the eastern coast of the United States. Also another month to get china, this seems like hard work.

        "Having driverless cars is a great idea, but it could also be bad. It all depends on the person in the car and what types of decisions they're making. I think the world could work better with these cars. Although I also believe that these types of cars can be dangerous.\r\n\r\nIf businesses and manufacturers really wanted to, they could make these dream cars a reality. The cars that we have now are pretty close to being completly driver independent. All we would need to do is give the cars a few more updated sensors to replace the drivers. The updated sensors would act as the human reflexes; therefore creating better driving conditions. Hopefully this would create less wrecks or accidents.\r\n\r\nAlso these driverless cars should have updated satelites and cameras, so when there is a detour or road construction it will automatically update the cars route. This will help backed up traffic a lot. If these cars could have the best technology that's out there today, they would already be a success. For now that's the only thing that's keeping the cars from success.\r\n\r\nSome people may be worried about the safety of these cars becasue at any moment in time there could be a glitch in the computer software, and that small glitch could cause an accident any second of any day. I, on the other hand, am not worried about that, becasue even if one car has a giltch there will be many other smartcars on the road to help avoid an accident.",
        "I believe driverless cars are coming, because of Technology, safety and the world's view on this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nThe technology we have today is the technology we need for driverless cars. Granted the cost of the technology is not affordable for everyday buys. \"The smart road systems work well\" said by google employers. They believe the upgrade need for the driverless car brings them a step closer to actually putting it on the market. Apparently , the cars needs new starters for it.\r\n\r\nGoogle used the toyota Primus radar sensor, a GPS reciever and an inertial motion sensor to upgrade the starter. They use the combination of all these different materials\r\n\r\nto impersonate a human driving the car.\r\n\r\nThe safety of the car is a big factor leading into the future. The google car has went more than half a million miles without a crash. I do not know too many people who drive now that have went that long without being in some kind of car crash. The safety is also more effecient because it alerts the driver to when they need to take over. The motion sensor\r\n\r\nmakes sure the driver hands never leave the wheel. These features are game changers to how people drive from here forward.\r\n\r\nI believe the world will accept the change to driverless cars . I think the cars would hit the market and sell a trendmendous amount as soon as they release. The technology to these cars are nothing new like the sensors or the radios . They are just used in a different way than before to increase a car technology and safety of others. The cars would say some energy from the engine through the sensors.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion to the topic of driverless cars is they will eventually happen.",
        "We found a face on landforms on Mars. Some think it was an alien life form and others think it was just a shadow. The faces on the landforms are shadows that show an illusion of a face.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the face in the pictures they all look like huge landforms with a face. Most of those pictures with a face shows the eyes, nose, and mouth all look darker than the face itself. Other scientist here proved that the eyes, nose, and mouths on these landforms are shadows. \"The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.'\"",

The diverless cars are smart in many ways that normal cars aren't.\r\n\r\nThey are not completely driverless but the are very close. The diverless cars are a wise choice for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Diverless cars have many cool gadget that makes the car safer. The car comes with a Spinning sensor on the roof which is laser beams constantly updating 3D model of the car surroundings. The diverless car also has a video camera on the rear view mirror that is always watching the diver, to insure that they are always paying attention. The car also has 4 atomotive sensors, and a GPS recevier. As you can see all of these things make the car safe and easy.\r\n\r\nThese cars are not completley driverless, they do need human skills in some senarios, such as when the car approches a car accedent it would need the driver to drive through it. If this were to happen then the car would vibrte the drivers seat to warn them that there is a dangerous situation and they need to intervine. Other than that the car can do many things it can steeer its self, accelerate, and brake with no human help required.\r\n\r\nThe diverless cars are not legal everywhere yet.",

        "I vow against the value of using technology to read student's emotional expressions. My reasoning is big data companies will configure this to their advantage and bordeom in a classroom can guide someone toward something higher.\r\n\r\nTo begin,\"Big Brother\" will exploit this in order to make money off of it unsuspectedly. The text gives an example of what the technology can do in terms of personalizing ads. It does not matter who someone is big data companies, will find clever ways of gathering anyones data in exchange making life more simple no matter if that person is student or not. Once the data is stockpiled, it is on the internet and avaliable to anyone that pays for it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, bordeom as terrible as it sounds is good for the brain. Bordeom in the text is mentioned as something that looms in the learning environment and this new technology can help create a more effective lesson. The second society lets such algorithms coexist with AI that is when the people lose control of their lives; because, it will let robotic minds make decisions for society.

        "I believe that driverless cars are pointless. They aren't really driverless, there are laws in some states against testing driverless cars, the traffic laws are written assuming that it is most safe to have a human driving the car & you don't know who will be to blame if an accident or something goes wrong.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars aren't fully driverless. The driver still has to take over when pulling in and out of driveways & dealing with complicated traffic issues. For example, navigating through roadwork or an accident. What's the point of having a driverless car, when you still have to be alert and paying attention? People want a driverless car so they don't have to do any work.Many people don't pay attention sometimes or get distracted while driving. This a dangerous disadvantage. The driver could be distracted and get into an accident because they weren't paying attention and didn't take over the car when they needed to.\r\n\r\nThe laws for driving rely on an alert driver to achieve safety while driving. Today, traffic laws are written assuming that the only way a car is safe is if it has a human driver in control at all times. In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars.Manufacturers hope that more states will allow them if they are proven to be more safe. However, if there is an accident involving a driverless car who will be to blame the manufacturer or the driver?\r\n\r\nDriverless cars also require a lot of sensors to mimic the controls of a human driver.Google's modified Toyota Prius uses sensors on the left rear wheel. on the roof, a video camera near the rear view mirror, four radar sensors, GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor.",
        "My agrument for this passage is that although theses cars seem to be really nice and might help save people from accidients and save money they may not be the best option. Driving is a very serious thing and in this agrument I'm going to tell why i think that they shouldn't be made. Driving can always need improvement why not keep the cars we have and help them out and keep people driving what they own. Plus money is a very important aspect in this agrument, having a driveless car can cost lots of money.\r\n\r\nPeople who drive can say that they don't like driving all the time but most can say that they enjoy getting to drive if we have cars that are driveless that takes away the fun that people have. If we make these driveless cars that means that the newer generations with not know how to drive cars. People will not want ot get put as much if we have driveless cars. I don't think that people have the money to spend on these cars to drive them so we may have lots of people walking if we were to switch to these cars.\r\n\r\nIf driveless cars are made they is a very big possibility that people will not want to pay attention to the roads and that will cause more accidents than what there already is. Even though the drive is suppose to watch the road when in the car still doesn't mean that people wont think that the car can do it all on its own. They will not watch the road as much as what they do now and it can cause wrecks that are not needed.\r\n\r\nHaving drivers have a driveless car is not a good idea because they willl think it is okay to play on their phones and mess around in the car. The car may have antilock brakes but that does not mean that the car is completely save for being accident free. If we have teenagers that are driving in these cars they might think that it is expectable to play around even more than what they do now. Maybe adding things to cra sthat we have now and giving them some newer safety assets might be the solution to our problem.",
        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. As driverless cars are becoming a new deveoping technology, it's best to ask yourself, \"Are driverless cars really a necessity?\" The answer is, no, they are not a necessity for many reasons. We should not continue to develope driverless cars mainly because; driverless cars are not completely driverless, the car would need a new built-in entertainment system to put inside of the car, and if something were to go wrong with the car, who is to blame for this?\r\n\r\nWhen you hear the words, \"driverless car\" what comes to mind? Perhaps, you think of a car that can take you anywhere, and young teens the age of thirteen not needing an adult to drive them to a desired destination. However, driverless cars are not 100% driverless. In the article, the cars are said to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, because of this an alert driver is said to still be required. People are still needed to be able to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Manufacturers are still working on creating new ways to alert the driver when human skills are needed, but it is no secret that this will continue to cost money.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why we should not have driverless cars, is because to have them, companies think a built-in entertainment system should be created, installed and required inside of all driverless vehicals. Today, we already have vehicals that contain a television inside for the passengers who occupy the back seats, to help keeped them entertained. This new entertainment system is said to shut off when the car needs the driver to take over and will not be available to a driver who is texting or using their phone in any way.",
        "When we use facial expressions it lets the person you are directing the expressions to know how we are feeling. We smile because we are happy, we frown because we are sad, we raise our eyebrows because we are shocked or surprised. We use usually identify those pretty well, but a computer can identify them better. I am for the value of using techology to read student's emotional expressions because teachers need to know what bores them or what excites them.\r\n\r\nWhen I first began to read this, I thought how can technology read our emotions? Then it states in paragraph 3 that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. With all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like human muscles. This computer can identify 6 basic emotion: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. With that type of skill, teachers can know what students like and don't like.\r\n\r\nStudents get easily bored when it comes to school. When they come into the classroom, they don't want to do the homework or the classwork that was given to them.",

The author did a very good job of explaining the reasons on why Venus is the closest planet to Earth , however he did leave out a few important ideas. The author failed to mention cost, reason, and a plan to actually get to Venus. A trip to Venus has a lot of reprecussions that the author didn't explain.\r\n\r\nThe author failed to bring up cost on why we should explore Venus. He did so purposely because the astrinomical cost of making a trip to Venus is far greater than our need of another planet. The obstacles scientists and astronauts have to overcome sound very expensive. In the text it states that Venus's average surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and that atmospheric pressure on Venus is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These 2 obstacles, around a 700 degree temperature increase and 90 times greater pressure than on Earth would require a lot of funds to overcome these problems.",
        "\"Are driverless cars coming?\" I'm against driverless cars because of saftey, cost, and law.\r\n\r\nTo begin, i'm against the driverless car because of the saftey issues. In the article it says that \"if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture\". Also in the article it points out, driverless cars have light signals to indicate traffic jams and other saftey issues.(What if a person is on a phone or is not paying attention and a car comes out in front of them and the signals dont show in time and someone is hurt).Another saftey problem is the antilock breaks. As you can see their are many things that can go wrong with this car showing that it's not yet saftey to be on the road.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the driverless car is a long way from being perfect because of the cost. The cars need smart roads to function. So the cost will fly up because of the updates to support the car. An supporting detail from the article is, \"These smart roads systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\" People that is less fortunate that wants to by the \"eco saving\" car would have to pay a enormous amount of money to get this brain car. Another detail from the passage is, Without the option of smarter roads, manufactures turned to smarter cars...\" If the manufactures didn't upgrade the roads they had to upgrade the car but it's still a major amount of money going in these cars. So this means what they paid to upgrade the car is going to double when someone wnats to buy it. The expens of this so called smart car is not worth buying.",

        "I believe that driverless cars should not be built. They seem like a good idea at the first look but imagine there would be so many downsides to owning one of these vehicles. First of all they would be extremely expensive to build and buy and the delicate snesors used in these vehicles could easly be broken or damaged. Also people would have the ability to hack into the servers that would run these vehicles and essentially make them do whatever they wanted, whether it be to wreck or cause an accident. And what would happen if one of these vehicles were to malfunction and cause the death of a driver, passenger, or pedestrian. I feel there are too many risks and downsides to be producing these vehicles.\r\n\r\nEven if we were to make these vehicles mainstream and sell them people would find something wrong with them like they always do. And if not that they would find ways around safety measures added to the vehicles. For example preasure sensors could be added to the steering wheel to only allow the cars to drive if someone has there hands on it, but someone could just tightly wrap tape or something else around the wheel instead and cause an accident.",

        "Have you ever been really bored of something, but your teacher in class can't tell? The Facial Action Coding system can be enabled on computers that can identify human emotions. There have been many scientists and researchers that are working on this so it can detect your emotions by the muscles in your body. It is kind of like when you are trying to detect a friends emotion because you can tell how they are feeling.\r\n\r\nImagine this a system that can read your emotions based on your facial expressions that is based off of facial muscles. This is something we already kind of do when we try to tell a friends facial expressions. This is something that we humans should be happy to have we hate being bored and a computer would be able to tell that we are, so it would never play that video or ad again which would make it would modify the lesson for each person according to Huang. Also if you really liked that video or ad that was just played they would play simliar ones to it.\r\n\r\nDr. Huang also explains that most communication is non verbal in fact most of our communication is non verbal.\r\n\r\nSo, what is the Facial Action Coding System you might be thinking. Well the facial action coding system is a computer that constructs a 3d model of each persons face. This must take a while since we do have 44 major muscles in our face. This computer is basically supposed to be able to detect at least the 6 main basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The machine can do so by it can tell the characteristic movements of each facial muscle. The article describes like when you raise your eyebrows you show surpise and when the muscles around your lips it shows anger. This can be benificial in a lot of ways especially when it can tell that you don't like something. Also humans might try to guess facial traits, but we can't describe each facial trait someone has.\r\n\r\nSurely you are thinking that a machine can't detect somebodies emotions, but it could detect that the Mona Lisa she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted,6% fearful, and\r\n\r\n2% angry.",

        "In the article ''Driverless Cars Are Coming,'' they talk about how there is a new invention coming. As you can tell by the title of the article, they give some pros and cons about the new invention. Some thing's the author of the article mentions is how the car works and what kind of details will be in it.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things they mentioned was how the car works. It tell's how the car would run on half the fuel we use today. Google has already made a car that is ''driverless' and it has not crashed yet. These cars would run on a track that has an electrical cable that sends radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car.\r\n\r\nFurther on, they also explained some details they might add to the car. One of the details is that the car can handle functions up to twenty-five miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Not all of the cars are completely driverless. In fact, the only main things they can do are steer,accelerate, and brake. All are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. Another detail they have is that the drivers seat vibrates when the vehicle is in dangerof backing into something. One last detail they mention is having cameras watch the driver to make sure that the drivers a remaining focused on the road.\r\n\r\nWith both of those topics being mentioned, I honestly do not think they should make the cars for public use.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. For example the author states ''A classroom computer could recognize when a studeny is becoming confused or bored,''Dr Huang predicts.''Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor''(Making Mona Lisan smile).\r\n\r\nThis new system is also really smart in detecting oneself emotions for example,the author also states that''But in a false smile,the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie;these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ''smiling''politician or celebrity isn't being truthful''(Making Mona lisa Smile).\r\n\r\nThis is important because this new technology system can help a lot with kids education.\r\n\r\nSometimes kids are afraid of asking their teachers for help because they feel embarrased but with this new technology system it will actually make students feel not afraid or embarrased.\r\n\r\nStudents are actually going to get help without having to ask a teacher because the Facial Action Coding System will be able to recognize if a student is confused or bored and then it's going to come in with help.\r\n\r\nAlso this new system can help teachers know how students are feeling towards a subject and how they are doing on a certain subject. The new system will make it easier for teachers and will also save them a huge time rather than asking or doing tests to show results on how well they know the lesson.",
        "Can you picture a life without human in control of driving? Yes, it might sound like a good idea but its more realistic then you think. In the article Driverless Cars Are Coming it states \" Telsa has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of dring on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes- Benz, Audi and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020\". Humans have always been driving cars since say cars have been invented. The idea of drivless car is new since humans have always been in control manually. Driverless cars is a idea that is inot logical. There no point in making driverless cars for people to use.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to a car there are so many parts that could go wrong. Imagine what could go on with a car that is driverless. A driverless car would have more technology parts then a normal car does. If a part goes damage you don't know what the damage could be. This idea is new and so many people will not be able to fix a part on their driverless car. Technology is still a very new idea and their people who don't know how to use it.\r\n\r\nWho really need a driverless\r\n\r\ncar in life. This idea will just increase the laziness people will have. People would depend on this car and forget how to drive a car. Life today is just fiding new ideas to make humans life easier. This car will increase the laziness in humans and make their life harder then they think. In the article is say\" Why would would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?\". This idea takes out the fun in driving a car and makes it extremely boring.\r\n\r\nThis would affect finacially people. Not everyone would be able to afford a car that is driverless. Some people can barely afford a 2002 car let alone a new driverless car.",

        "I beleive that the use of the 'Facial Action Coding System' to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is valuable and nearly detremental to a student that's learning online. In a classrom with an instructure leacturing, if the student becomes confused, he or she can raise their hand and ask a question. A teacher may even notice when a student is confused by the facial expression they make. Though, learning online is an independent task and most of the time, you don't have anyone to truly explain and fill you in on what you're just simply not grasping on to.\r\n\r\nUsing this new form of technology can be helpful to not only the student, but the website or app they are learning from. For example, if a student is reading an article, the website owner or app designer will know if most students find the article interesting or are able to see if the article provided is truly at grade level. The Facial Action Coding System could also be used in grade school type settings. There are plenty of websites now for the education of children, like ABCmouse.com. The program can possibly give the feedback of the child's emotions and sense of awareness to their parents while using the program. With that, it proves my point that the use of this technology is beneficial to all ages.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in paragraph 5, the author stated \"In fact we humans perform this same impressive \"calculation\" every day.\" then later gave an example of the ability that we have to tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look or her face. As human beings, this most likely began as an instict in order to tell how one another may react, attack, ect. Although now, we are much more than that. Some are striving to be heart surgeons or rocket scientists. We need to have the technology to explain the question in a different way if the student doesn't understand.\r\n\r\nA kid may get a bad grade on something simply because of the way the question was stated. That kid could be a genious but just learns in a differnet way.",
        "I have mixed feelings about driverless cars for many reasons even though it does have its positive effects. Can these cars be the next step of evolution in the manufacturing industry or can it be hazardous?\r\n\r\nDriverless cars do seem like a futuristic idea that does sound very amazing and can possibly happen, lets talk about some of the positves of these cars. Driverless cars are very efficient in the fact of not wasting fuels and or saving fuel as stated in paragraph one. Driverless cars will always be very aware of its own surroundings, they are equiped with sensors to stop the car, alert the drivers, or shall I say \"Passangers\" of any danger, etc. Google has had these cars go around the country and they have gone more than half a million miles without a single crash, in my own opinion, a car with a driver would have most likely crashed within those miles. Although these cars have their positives, they are also negative because they are not completely \"driverless\".\r\n\r\nThese cars are not independent for the most part. They require a driver to be in the car, but stay nuetral until the car needs help moving around an obstacle, for example a traffic jam or car crash. I do not like the fact that this is not a fully independant car, the passanger of the car is supposed to be fully aware of the vehicle and its surroundings while it is moving, but lets be honest, being in a car and not having to drive for once will make the passanger not pay attention to their surroundings, they can fall asleep and or be on their phones, etc, that is a problem. What if the car has an engineering problem and nearly drives off the road or causes an accident, is it the drivers fault or the cars fault?",
        "The future is coming at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are not just ideas anymore.\r\n\r\nThey are being manufactured and tested at this very moment.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars can be seen as both good and bad, but I do not think they are good for society just yet.\r\n\r\nFor cars to be driverless, they would have to be able to respond quickly to anything, at anytime.\r\n\r\nThey would also need to possess a faster reaction time than humans.\r\n\r\nIf all of these features were put into a car, then it is no longer a car; it is a robotic machine, capable of making decisions that could mean life or death of the passengers and nearby pedestrians.\r\n\r\nHowever, as of now, cars are still not entirely driverless.\r\n\r\nWe do not yet have the technology to manufacture cars that have the human qualities that are necessary in driving, such as natural reflexes to avoid obstacles blocking the path.\r\n\r\nThe world we live in today is not the same world we lived in yesterday, or the world we will live in tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe technology we currenetly have is progressing at an alarming speed.\r\n\r\nToday it's smart cars, tomorrow it's smart houses, and the next day it's smart people.\r\n\r\nTechnology is a good thing, but humans are so fixated on making everything bigger and better that they forget how good it is now.\r\n\r\nWhat will come of the human population if we solely rely on techonolgy and not each other?\r\n\r\nIf driverless cars become the sole transportation for short distances over land, then humans will not find a need to work on their hand- eye coordination and reflexes.\r\n\r\nIf that were to happen, then people will start to lose those motor functions.\r\n\r\nWith the speedy progression of technology, humans are slowly beginning to devolve.\r\n\r\nWith the production of smart phones and other tablets, humans have shorter attention spans than their ancestors.",
        "I think that if we ever did find aliens on Mars or even a civilazation we should stay away from it. The reason why is because if we ever did find a other planet we never really be called the only planet in the universe. In the article we found out that we have a new way to find people. We never really thought that their was ever a civilazation on Mars.\r\n\r\nAs we found out that we may have found a way to a other civilazation. I just recently told you that we should never go near Mars. The reason why I told you that is because we don't now their lifes, their ways, or even if they were freindly. When NASA told us that we have a way to find people we should never talk to them. Yes it does show that we had images of planet Mars or even that their might have been a culture.",
        "Think about the time you felt extremely tired. That time where you could barely keep your eyes open, everything you heard was a blob, because you were simply zoned out. You were feeling tired. For me this time would be sitting in my english class learning about Shakespeare. I felt as if the time were never ending in that class. Students all around me had the same facial expression on them. Facial expressions are a huge key of communication. When you are out in public you see many faces around, and you can easily assume their emotions and what they are feeling. With technology being a huge factor in tody's society, we can now use it to determine someone's emotion. I believe that using technology to read emotional expressions on students could really bring forth value in classrooms.\r\n\r\nStudents all over the school have different things going on. They show and deplict off different emotions at an instant. Sometimes these emotions make it hard for students to concentrate in class during instructions or new lessons given by the teachers. Referring back to the article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", Nick D'Alto, the writer, writes about a new software called the Facial Action Coding System. The new sytem was developed to determine the accuracy of emotions of people around us. If this software were to be implemented in our school, then this could be an advantage in shaping a better society. The software will help teachers determine the emotions students are feeling at the time of lecture. D'Alto quotes Dr. Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicting that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". Once recognizing the emotions of the student, Dr. Huang continues predicting that the software can \"Then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"",
        "They have many things that show that the landform is natrual. One reason that the landform could be real is by pointing out that back then the cameras were not as good with quality so the camera could make it look like that. Another reason could also br the weather in that time the weather could have a big part in the way it looks.\r\n\r\nThe angel of the camera could also make a big diffrence in the look of it. the angel of the light that was ln it also could mae the changed because it was the shadow that made the landform look like a human head. Back then the pixels of the photo were 43 meters compared to now which is 1.56 meters. The clouds could also change the look.\r\n\r\nMany things could of changed it those are many reasons why it is real but people think diffrent ly and also have diffrent things formed in there head.",
        "Reading someones facial expression may be effective sometimes but that does not mean that they are actually feeling a certain emotion like anger and confusion for example, but they could be feeling extremely happy. In the article, the author stated that Dr. Huang used a picture of Mona Lisa to test the new emotion-recognition software but the software may not be effective because they tested it on a painted photo and not a real living person. Also, da Vinci could have exagerrated Mona Lisas facial expression for the sake of the painting so they may not be accurate.\r\n\r\nUsing this software in a classroom may not be effective because if a student is making a certain face that does not mean that they are bored or confused, it could just be how their face naturally looks. The software can also mis read their face and even glitch. The use of this program would require the use of a camera through the computer and that is not always safe. Hackers could be trying to hack their computer and steal personal information from the person or even their identity.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this software is not valuable for classroom use because students have other things that they need other then a facial coding system. If the student knows that the camera is active then that could even become a distraction to them so they use of this software is not needed.",

To what the passage tells I think the Face was created by something other than an alien.

Throughout the years of the world, many landforms be been formed due to the weather and nothing else. The text tells of how scientists flew over to where the Face is located and clearly stated that this Face was a natural landform and that there was no monument made be aliens after all.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have read and heard about mars, there is no such thing as life on that planet. Many may argue that there is such thing as aliens on mars and that they did create or form this landform. The text states that due to the time of season, skeptics may believe that alien markings were hidden by the haze. Little do they realize that with the technology the scientists could make the photo bigger to see closer in to what the face looked like up close and the markings or anything that surround the area of the Face.\r\n\r\nIn the last paragraph of the passage, the text states that this picture show the equivalence to a butte or mesa.\r\n\r\nAlso according to the text that there are landforms common to this one in the American West.",

        "Luke is a boy signing up with his friend Don,here's some reason's why you should also sign up like Luke did himself. My first reason is you can help people while you travel like how Luke did when he went to europe to help people restock on supplies,food,and animals. You can also go because,while you're shipping animals across seas you can spend time with somepretty amazing animals. Another good one is you can go sightseeing while shipping or going on the land you shipped something to like how Luke did when he went to Europe. These are all great in my point of view because even its some hard work it can still be enjoyable because there is just so much to see like how I mentioned the animals before,and of course the sightslike ruins,structures,and much more. Another point of fun you could have while being a seagoing cowboy is after you shp the animals off of the boat or ship when the animals are gone it can clear up some room for you and any friends you may or may not have made. What I mean is after the animals are gone you can use the extra room for games,messing around,and even spending time with friends you may have made. THis is a good idea because even thogh its hard work and a little bit dangerous Luke stayed positive because of him stating \"The cattle boat trps were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy\" meaning he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy. Now even though its still fun to be a seagoing cowboy there is still dangers. The ocean is a pretty dangerous place so it'll still be a hard job especially when it comes to storms. If a serious storm hits while on a boat trip it could still be pretty devastating someone could get knocked off and go into the ocean,one of the animals could fall off,and someone cold slide and break something when they have a hard fall.",
        "It's Not An Alien\r\n\r\nIn my opinion I don't think this is a face created by aliens becuase there are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. Maybe scientists have found unusaul things and claim aliens have created them but there is no proof that aliens are real.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think it is not a face is because in \"Unmasking the ace of Mars\" it said,\"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this onbe had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egytian Pharoah.

        "The role of driverless cars have become bigger and more accessable to the public and companies. There are pros and cons to these new developments but ultimately I believe they are for the best.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are downsides to having driverless cars at the moment, such as not being comletely automatic, that will probably change in the future. The problem now is that the cars only automate themselves in certain situations so the driver has to be alert and ready to take over the wheel. So what's the\r\n\r\npoint of having a driverless car where you have to be alert at every moment? That is only a problem of the present. If more time and research is put into this project than eventually we will get cars that can drive automaticaly on the road full time without the need of being alert at all times. Human drivers make mistakes and that can cause harm to themselves and to others. Without the variable to human mistake, and if we could perfect the driverless car, there would be virtually no car crashes or car related injuries. Driverless cars have sensors and that let them take the right course of action or brake at the right time which could otherwise lead to accidents.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are getting smarter.",

        "I do not agree with the whole driverless car thing. To start off it is dangerous. The idea that the person has to always be alert defeats the purpose of it being driverless. Also the alerts to get the drivers attention should not be needed. I mean if someone creates a driverless car they should actually make it so it is, in fact, driverless.\r\n\r\nOn long road trips I get that one person has to drive the whole time, and yes the driver could get tired and want to take a nap. This would be good for them but even if the driver were to go to sleep and be awaken to an accident in front of them. You cannot expect a human that has been sleeping to be completely in control of what is going on at the time. Who knows, they might freak out and run into something else. There are so many possibilities that something could go horribly wrong with driverless car.\r\n\r\nYes, I know almost everyone expects to have all this new technology in the future.

In paragraph 7, the text clearly states, \" There was no alien monument after all.\"\r\n\r\nThis means that aliens could not have created the Face as a signification or monument to proof thier existance.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Face is a landform.

        "The way that a detective can identify lying, or truthfulness is impressive to people, while decoding emotions is definitely a little more complicated. Even if it may seem like its easy to tell how someone's feeling, and you can see your friend is simply upset, or excited, like the article said, explaining them and reading more complicated emotions, most likely isnt as easy. Technology to read our emotions is definitely a sign that software is getting more advanced, but not neccecarily more helpful. This software of course can be benfited from in ways of entertainment and efficiencey in technology, but in classrooms, I think that it's a different debate. And my thoughts of this in classrooms are that it's pretty much the opposite of helpful.\r\n\r\nIn this article, the example they use to show how it could be efficient in schools is '\"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" and then goes on to say how the software could change the lesson for them, or give some help. What would an average student (saying this software isnt yet in classrooms) do\r\n\r\nin the same situation? Raise their hand, ask for help from a teacher, and get personal help just the same way the technology would solve the problem. To be fair though, not all students have an available teacher, or some work at home, what could those students do? Contact someone else (like a teacher for example in online school), figure it out, and eventually understand the problem all the same. With this technology of course, the idea is that the student doesnt have to put in any effort of asking for help, and could identify the eventual solution by just showing emotion. Worded differently, this entire example of how classroom\r\n\r\ncomputers are beneficial, could become a statement of flaws in this idea.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the software could most likely be easily tricked, and for the evidence of students easily being able to get help & manipulate the lesson by emotions, the student could also manipulate the lesson purposefully, using the softwares features to easily get ahead in problems, or simply not put much effort into understanding it. For the point of ease becuse of the software with students who are simply confused is a good point, but what about the lessons that communicating teaches them? The future of their life isnt going to be only technology-based, and what happens when people rely too much on the ease of simply getting their emotions read, and start to not as easily communicate with actual people.

We should believe Scientist at NASA,because they have facts and pictures that look like faces made of landforms. Scientist claim they know the facts of what looks like a landform and they think this is a posibility that this is one of them. Also, We should believe its landforms because nobody has ever seen aliens before they just think that they look like on what they have on social media etc. Even if they look like what we have in pictures that still would NOT be an aliens face!! If you look at the picture it might actually look like a formed face but its not .We should also believe NASA because .. they are scientificly trained to look at these and study things to see and know what they are .. Why would you really believe and think you know whats on the internet instead of believing things that you see! Use research!\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,I think the face is a landform because if so , aliens do not look like humans and the faces on mars looks like a human face and i think we should stop assuming and go with the facts from NASA.",
        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author has a very optimisstic look on the chances of touching ground and exploring Venus someday. The author includes the risk that humans would be taking by touching ground on Venus and why humans can not withstand the conditions of the surface of the planet. But, the author counteracts the risks with new ideas of technology that we can use and some alternative ways to get closer to Venus. The article is told in a professional type way by stating the pros and cons of why we haven't been on Venus yet. But, the article also gives evidence of why humans shouldn't let the cons hold humans back from someday making it to Venus's surface safely.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 2, the author begins by creating the illusion that Venus is quite simply, \"...right around the corner...\". He also states that \"...Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too.\" These two statements alone start the paragraph off with the sense that Venus is a \"simple\" planet we could explore and that is easier to access distance wise. The author then goes on to tell us in paragraph 3 the dangers of Venus and the reason why humans haven't explored this \"simple\" plant yet. He then transitions back into an optimisstic tone by curiously explaining the past on Venus and comparing Venus to our home planet of Earth. For example, in paragraph 4, he states that \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\"",

These cars can also \"steer, accelerate, and brake themselves,\" but still are designed to tell the driver when they are needed to do tasks only the drivers can do. The information coming from the sensors can cause the car to apply \"brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control,\" than a driver can manage alone.

        "Can Cars really be driverless? This article gives us information on the science beneath the production of the driverless car. The car has some ups and downs to it, however, the technology is becoming more and more advanced and understood as we go throughout the years.\r\n\r\nThe driverless car has some great advantages to it. In the 1950s General Motors created what they call a concept car that only ran on a special test track. The track had embedded eletrical cable which sent radio signals to the car. The technology put into a car has a dubbed LIDAR, which uses and constantly updates a 3-D mode of the cars surroundings. The combination allows the driverless car to be able to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. The car manufacturers are considering putting cameras in the car to watch and make sure the drivers are still aware of what is going on on the road.\r\n\r\nHowever there are still some downfalls to the driverless cars. Although they have figured out how to make it to where the car can drive on the freeway hands free and be able to park hands free, you are never really not driving the car. A comon question asked is \"Wouldn't the driver get board wating for their turn to drive?\" Well you have to be in full alert even if you are just sitting in the car. They have created technlology to where the person sitting in the car will get alerts when they need to take over. Say the car is on the freeway and it comes to a work zone. The car will send an alert telling the driver to take over.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are on a great road to becoming something great.",
        "I'm against these cars 100 percent just for the simple fact that computers are trying to take over this world. They take jobs from people everday and it really sad, and now they are trying to take driving away from us, like one thing where we can still actually control.\r\n\r\nThat is really funny in my opinion, if it madders? Well, anyways I feel that this is not the way to get around it will eventually have wrecks which will have bad rep if they start wrecking a lot, and they will if you get enough on the road. What I do not like is that you have to stay alert while driving it I could see if you could sleep on the way while it drives. This is crazy you have to stay alert to drive a driverless car why not just drive a real car youself what do you not stay alert driveing a real car? I know I am a good alert defensive drive like everyone should this driverless car idea just comes down to being lazy honestly. On to the gas well this might use half as a real car, but if the goverment was not so messed up then maybe we'd get paid decent money and gas could be a fair price that way we can find a happy medium for everyone. you just need to stay safe do not use your phone in the car if you have to pull over to see where you are going or to make a call/text. Just get a map they still have those you know that would be better to pull over and use in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this new \"car\" is dangerous I think it should not make it on the road we do not need it just drive why are we so lazy. If you cannot be an alert driver in a real car what makes you think you will be in this car.",
        "The author in this story has a totally different persepective on studying Venus than most people probably would. He tries not to focus on the negatives since we all know that it's humanly impossible to step foot on Venus. He feels that hummanity shouldn't just give up on the mission forvever becasue it's dangerous and we have doubts on the mission. He looks at it as motivation and a challenge, rather than impossible. You never know what we could discover there so it's always good to have a strong imagination even if people think you're crazy, because those people change the world.\r\n\r\nNASA is still looking into this research. They understand that they can't send humans to the planet, but they have a plan to send scientists in space to float above Venus and do their research from up there. Obviously their information wouldn't be as valid from being up above the planet rather than being on the planet, but it's the closest they can get to this day. In the future they hope to be able to create technology and machinery that is strong enough to withstand the preasure and heat from the burning planet. Resaerchers believe that long ago Venus was a lot like Earth, and was covered with a lot of similar features like valleys, mountains, and craters.

Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. In \"The Challange of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursit despite the danger it presents. Three reasons that supports author idea is Venus has dangerous geology and weather , the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, and the surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe fisrt reason is Venus present dangerous geology and weather. In Venus, the climate and weather are worst and danger which make nothing to survive. in a paragraph, it said \" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting vocanoes, powerful earthquake, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface.\" This show why it's danger for anything that land on Venus.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is venus has the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. In a paragraph, it said \" The cloud conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth; scuh as enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\" this show how it is dangerous to humans and enviroments.\r\n\r\nThe third reason is the surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fehrenheit. Also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our planet.",
        "When someone hears the words \"driverless cars\", they get excited at the thought of something so futuristic at one time that it seems like something out of a science fiction novel. However, now that dream is becoming a reality. Large companies such as Google or BMW are advancing in this highly experimental field, and Google has been since as early as 2009. But is letting the machine take over most of the time really the best option? Could it lead to even more problems than it hopes to fix? These questions have yet to be answered and need to be.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, BMW began developing a project they dubbed the \"Traffic Jam Assistant\", allowing a car to handle all possible functions up to the speed of 25 mph. But even though the car drove itself, the driver still had to remain alert and keep both hands on the wheel where sensors were located. And in such situations as work zones or accidents, the driver had to take over. Moments like these should always be handled by the driver, because the only thing a vehicle needs is one single driver. If a pedestrian ever makes the mistake of crossing too late on a crosswalk in the middle of the street, the car is not going to be ablle to know if it is coming or not or whether the car can steer clear of causing an accident because of human error.\r\n\r\nThere is also the consideration of laws. In our current era, whoever hits someone initially in a traffic collision, is the one to blame, and the one who helps pay off the other driver's bill. Human error is a natural thing, and we all make mistakes, but if there is ever an accident in which an autonomous car is made and is involved in an accident, who is responsible in the end? Is it the driver, or is it the car which is supposed to be incapable of making mistakes? Allowing a car to be responsible for one person's life is not the best decision, and should be thought out more accordingly, than just seeing it as a fun toy because our laziness is growing so much, that we can't even drive for ourselves.\r\n\r\nThen there is the cost, both on our wealth and our experience. If we allow cars to drive us around and take us anywhere we like, what will happen when it's our turn to drive. We will be less alert, paying attention to our surroundings instead of focusing on the road. Some may argue that cars come with warning signals that the driver must take control soon, but will they have enough time to completely survey the area and assess the situation?",

All the new idea flooding out of our minds dayley are deffinatly changing our tomorrow, but one in particular that could change us forever are driverless cars.\r\n\r\nScientist are slowly creating cars that will no longer need a driver. They are creating sensors all around the car that detect anything comming twoards them. They have yet to perfect these cars because they can't get the computer to understand the skills of driving in traffic, or anything unusual about the road like road blocks. Also many states will not agree to even let them test these vehicles there because the law states \"the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.\" (P9 L4/5)\r\n\r\nPersonally I do not think this creation is one of our better ideas. I do not like this idea because I love driving. I love being able to take control of my car and make it go as fast or slow as I want. Driving is a great responsiblity to have. I just don't see how letting a machine do everything for us is fun. Also these driverless cars are \"something that was simply too expensive to be practical\" (P3 L11/12) All the money put into these cars would make them nearly impossible to buy to about anyone who is not rich.\r\n\r\nMany other people will deffinatly disagree with me, and they might say that this will be a much safer alternative. Yes, it could be much safer because we would not have to worry about texting and driving, drunk driving, or any type of reckless driving.

The author of \"The Challenge of Exporing Venus\" explains by listing the reasons why we should, listing the challenges, and saying possible solutions to those challenges.\r\n\r\nSo, why should we explore one of the solar systems most hostile planet? Well, the author explains that, at times, Venus is the closest planet to Earth. It is considered to be Earth's twin, because both planets have similar density and size. It also could have been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. It has similar features geography such as valleys, mountains, and craters; scientists believe that, long ago, Venus was covered in huge oceans and could possibly support life.\r\n\r\nThis planet, that used to support life, is now hostile. The author tells the reader that the atmosphere of Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide, has sulfiric acid, and has an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's.

        "Our facial expressions can tell someone a lot about how we feel about something or situations in our lives, sometimes even better than verbal communication. Being able to read these expressions and change the environment around us could help the human race acheive the goal of becoming monumentally more happy people. Throughout the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author mentions many studies and facts relating to the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions. This would be very useful in the classroom because the studies shown have very intelligent figures present, the article includes a thourough explanation about how the FACS operates and succeeds, and how the technology could improve the willingness to learn and the ultimate goal of maintaining happiness.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in paragraph 6, the diction in the paragraph and the implementation of an interview with an intelligent figure relating to the product prove that this machine could make a vital difference in a classroom-style learning environment. For exmaple, author Nick D'Alto interviews Dr. and Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang works with other professors such as Nicu Sebe on the FACS, and in this pragraph he states many important facts about how computers could alter the learning environment based on how the student feels. Dr. Huang says, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"\r\n\r\nBeing able to modify a lesson for a single student rather than an entire group could make a huge difference. Rather than the teacher having to chage the whole lesson for the entire class, the computer could \"read\" and individual student's face and effectively personalize the lesson for that student alone. This technology could supply a much needed change to the sometimes ineffective teaching of an instructor.\r\n\r\nAlso, in paragraphs 7 and 8, detailed instructions are given on how the machine works and how it can detect fake emotions from real emotions. For example, at the end of paragraph 7, the author states the difference between the muscle movements in a real and fake smile. He then states how the machine looks for the muscle movements and formations of a real smile rather than those of a fake one. Also, in paragraph 8, even more examples of differences in muscle formation are used to show how the technology will in fact work in a classroom environment.",
        "Students go to school everyday,and throughtout\r\n\r\ntheir day their mood and emotions can change. Ever wondered what their emotions was? No need to worry anymore there is a new technology that has just came upon us. Its called a Facial Action Coding System which allows computers to identify human emotions. Which is a stupid tool to be used in a classroom.\r\n\r\nThe FACS or readers reading this know it the Facial Action Coding System in my opinion is a not a tool that should be used in classroom for many reasons why. One of those reasons is that students go through various amounts of emotions in a day. One minute they can be happy then the next minute they can be upset. I feel as if it would be too time consuming for teachers to stop class and run a students face through a computer program to get how they are feeling. That would take away learning time not just for the child that is getting his face scan but the other kids in the classroom who would have to wait while the teacher runs the childs face.In paragraph three we can see that the process might take some time to do when the author says,\" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscless this in the model must move like human muscles.\" This shows that before you can even run the test the computer must be a model of your face which will add on to time.\r\n\r\nAlso another reason that the Facial Action Coding System shouldn't be used in classrooms is because its not gonna change the emotion of the kid. The teachers spends all of that time scanning a student face to get his emotion for no reason at all.",
        "The \"Evening Star\" as the author from \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" is another name for venus.

The author debates that the value of going to venus is worthy despite the dangers and obsticles we face.\r\n\r\nA point that the author provides is that Earth is similar to Venus and that we should conduct further studies on the planet. A point that the author makes quite often to show that we can learn about our planet based off learning from Venus, \"Today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters\" (Exploring Venus). from this peice of evidence it is clear that the author is trying to establish a link between earth and venus, That venus is very similar to us so it is worth exploring. Another example of the author connecting earth and Venus is when the author writes about what could of been on Venus \"Long ago, Venus was Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth\" (Exploring Venus). The wrtitter of this story specifically said \"just like Earth\" because his goal is to establish the scientific evidence that could be gained from going to Venus because it is similar to Earth.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the another reason that NASA should send a manned mission to Venus is that it may be the only chance at a expodition to another planet. The author provides information on how close Venus is and how this can be crucial \"occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimnes we are closer to mars and other times Venus\" (Exploring Venus).

Driverless car would make a huge change in our world today. There would be alot less bad things happening if they were driverless. People wouldnt have to go through the trouble to push the gas to make the care go or anything.\r\n\r\nThe postitive effects of turing to driveless cars are very high. People want this to happen so they are going to try to find all the positive thing about it and let other people know. The cars that Sergey Brin are creating would use half of the fuek that todays taxes and offer more flexibility than a bus. The cars have been driven more than half a million miles without crashing but the thing about that is that google care arent truly driverless. The cars still alret the driver when they are pullin gin and out of driveways or dealing with traffic suchas getting aroung roadwork and accidents.\r\n\r\nThe good thing right now is the cars are not completely driveless becuase you can steer, accelerate, and brake themseleves, but they are still designed to tell the driver that the road ahead requires them to something like get through work zones and around accidents.\r\n\r\nThere are many negitive thing to having driveless cars as well such as making sure that the automatic will happen at all times.

        "Driverless cars are definitly an advancement in society today. Although there are slightly independent cars today, it is projected that by 2020 Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan plan to have self driven automotives. In the article, \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" a decent amount of benifits were listed. One of those benifits are safety features, such as the inability to use a telocommunication device while in the vehicle.\r\n\r\nEach of the self driven automotives will have regulations. While the car is in the self driving mode the opperator must be alert. By doing this the driver must have both hands on the steering wheel. The steering wheels have a sensor built in; made to ensure that when road conditions ahead need human capabilities they can take over quickly and safely. Another restriction included in the driverless cars are the ability to shut off all systems instantly. For example in-car entertainment is a privlage but may be turned off when neccessary.\r\n\r\nThese self driven cars include many other features as well. GPS, Tire, motion, and radar sensors are installed in these vehicles. When in reverse newer cars have the ability to have a camera in there dash to see the surroundings behind them. Vibrating seats are a feature used to alert the driver when they are close to hitting an object around them. With these advancements in the self driving automotives the opporation system can be a copy cat of a human driver.\r\n\r\nNot only do the driverless cars have safety features but save on gas.",

If the driverless cars are responsive to crashes and quick breaking like they say the cars will be, then yeah i think the driverless cars are a great idea.\r\n\r\nThe movie industry has been showing us these kind of things such as driverless cars for decades. In the movies you will see flying cars or even driverless cars, so to see Google cofounder Sergey Brin taking a pledge and trying to create such a thing is really incredible. If manufactured right and having the right electronics and gadgets on it, these driverless cars could take over the future when it come to driving or selecting a car.\r\n\r\nBack in the 1950's, General Motors created a car that could run on a test track but with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the vehicle. Engineers at Barkley done something like that but with magnets that will \"self\" drive the car around the track. The only problem with that is the amount of money it would costs to supply the roads with these magnets they are wanting to put in the roads to control these cars. Also having these sensors and so much technology in the car it would not take much for something to go wrong, have the sensors in the car fail and you lose the front end of your car and causes a tramatic accident. So it is just little things that like that can put such a big downfall on a project like this.\r\n\r\nParagraph 9 talks about the laws that are directed to the regular gas, electrical and diesel vehicles, but what about the new driverless cars, won't you need new laws? Of course we will, that is one of the biggest things made in this case about the new cars, because new laws will need to be made in order to cover liability in the case of an accident.",
        "May 24, 2001 was the date it all started. When the \"Face on Mars\" conspiracy began. NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling a region of Mars called Cydonia. The Viking 1 was taking snapshots of the Cydonia when it spoted a shadowy figure close of a human face. This snapshot was sent to the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2. After careful review at the mission controllers at the Jet Propulision Lab they found out that it wasn't a human face. It turned out to be Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Although this one had an unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of the finding of the \"Face\" NASA unveiled the image for all the public to see. They added a capition to the image that quoted \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" The authors used the photo as a propaganda to get the publics attention to Mars, and it rsulted on good high notes. The \"Face of Mars\" became an pop icon from starring in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkut lines for 25years! Then to clear up that the \"Face\" didn't show signs of life Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped the same image ten times sharper and it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien momument after all. They tried another picture after people wouldn't believe the landform idea and the Martian came equivalent of a butte or mesa. Jim Garvin said it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the image of the \"Face On Mars\" sparked contrivsory in if it was a face or a natural landfrom.",
        "Many scientists and astronomers might ask \" Is exploring Venus worth the risk? This might be a question that is asked all around the world. Some people may find visiting Venus is too dangerous. Others really don't mind the challenge. The real question is, is NASA really going to conduct this unnecessary experiment?\r\n\r\nThe author seems like he or she is for exploring Venus. In paragraph 4, the author gives exceptional reasons on why Venus is a worthy pursuit. Also, the narrator seems like he or she is for sending humans to explore Venus. Throughout the whole article, the author is in favor of this idea. Well, an old friend of mine always said everything is not what it seems.\r\n\r\nThe author's idea of visiting Venus is valued but too risky. Paragraph 4 states \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.\" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because its most Earth like planet in the solar system. In paragraph 5, the article says \" NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.\" Additionally, all of this evidence supports my claim.",
        "The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He supports this idea by sharing that Venus once has been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. It expands human knowledge about the planet and enhances technology to be more capable of traveling to Venus.\r\n\r\nLong ago, Venus may have been an Earth-like planet. The planet brings danger but this won't stop scientist from disccusing how it may have been a sister planet to Earth. In the text it states \" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.\" This indicates that there were very common features about Venus long ago and even now that can relate to earth. The scientist are fascinated by these findings and are willing venture off to Venus and find out more.\r\n\r\nGoing to Venus is a tough job and can be quite dangerous. So technology is going to need to be upgraded to be able to fit Venus' harsh temperatures and atmosphere. Enhancing technology is whats going to keep people learning and wanting to improve. With these improvements travel to harsher planet will be easier. The text states \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out the way.\"",
        "The use of driveless cars can be defined as a statement of stupidity in your world today. They are not the way to the future as what this article say it is. All people need to have complete contorl of the wheel at all times. We learned that at a very young age and it needs to stick with us.\r\n\r\nMy position on this blanketed idea is that we in America should not have this type of car. There are many reasons for this ordeal. In the use of a drivelss car, many people would think to not even have to worry about driving the car since it can do it by themselves. So what happens if the car malfuncitons and the driver is asleep, then what happens, a crash, a death. That is a one reason on why we should not have these cars.\r\n\r\nAnother reason would be, the income and cost on these cars. The article doesn't state this material, but in order to make these cars so that they are drivelss, it would cost a lot more money than making an ordinary car. And the manufature has to sell it, so people are going to spend a lot more money than they have to on a car that they can drive by themselves. The money is not worth the risk.\r\n\r\nAlso google has stated that the car is not in complete control, a driver in needed. So, by this statement if a driver is needed then why do we need drivless cars if a driver is needed. Do we need them so people can text and call when they please, we have bluetooth cars for those situations. Also GM has pointed that, that in order for a car to be in complete control of the wheel, it needs roads that can read it's binary code.",

Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers.''",

This Facial Action Coding System could be incredibly valuable by reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.\r\n\r\nIn the article D'Alto states, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson..\" With this technology students may be able to understand lessons more quickly and easily. This coding system could also help more troubling students excel in the classroom while saving the teachers time. By modifying the lesson, the Facial Coding System would also keep the attention of learners. This could train students to become exception learners as they grow.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph eight of \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author describes how the muscles in the face change according to your mood.",
        "Wow! Did you know that Venus have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system? It was the second planet from our sun. Venus is very similar to earth. it was often called earth's rwin. It was one of the brighest points of light in the night sky. Scienctist tried to study Venus but they could not because they don't have devices that can stay longer than a week on Venus. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.\r\n\r\nNext, Venus is very similar to Earth. The Venus was often called Earth's twin because if you look at the Venus the color was blue and they believed taht Venus was probably covered largely with oceans. Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size and the distance are closest too. Just like in earth the Venus has a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. It was our nearest option for a planetary visit. It was one of their challenge to get to Venus and study about it. \"The Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\r\n\r\nSecond, photography and videography, and researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, Scienctist tried to study the Venus but they couldn't because they don't have any techonology that can be sent to Venus. Sometime they thought that sending people to Venus but since it was dangerous. They made electronics made of silicon carbide and they tested it. At first, it was work but it only last for onw week. Now, they are looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. This devices doesn't electronics it was faster, faster, and flexible.

        "Venus, a very powerful, interesting, planet that needs to be explored more indepth to ease our minds, to let the curiosity subdue. Venus is absolutely a planet that deserves a our attention. Why does it deserve our attention though; is it worth our time and money? If it was not worth all these risks, why would it be a topic of matter?\r\n\r\nIn the passage it states,\" Venus, sometimes called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.\" Many wondering minds think about all the possibilities of what could be on Venus and if it could be similar to Earth. Venus is our neighbor, or as paragraph 2 states,\" Earth's twin.\" \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\" If you had a brother or sister that close to you yet so far away wouldn't you want to find out about them?\r\n\r\nVenus should be worth the exploration because there are so many possibilies of what could be on Venus. The passage states,\" Venus still has some features that are analogous to those close to Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sedient and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" As crazy as it sounds, there is a chance that the sediments from Venus, and other objects like rocks, are here on Earth too. I believe that we have scientists already working on the break down of what is in these objects and how they got here.\r\n\r\nNASA workers have come up with the idea to send a hovering ship into orbit above Venus. Though the conditions are hard to work with, NASA has the capability to think of a way to let us receive information, pictures, and other objects from Venus. Towards the end of paragraph 5 it says, \" Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\"\r\n\r\nNASA should first send a demo rover out to Venus,before you send our people out. We have already discovered the conditions, like the air, and surface, of Venus.",
        "Have you ever been so confused when it comes to reading and understanding a person that you just ultimately cannot? A new technology system has been released to give exact percentages of a persons emotions just by looking into a camera. The Facial Action Coding System was designed to decode by using \"some new computer software that can recognize human emotions\" (1). The test subject, the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da VInci, has answered many questions when it comes to what she is expressing. The FACS can be valuable in classrooms because it can help with the studies of human anatomy or psychology, and it can help others understand each other.\r\n\r\nCalculating another persons emotions can help with understanding human anatomy and psychology classes at schools. For this software, human anatomy has a major role and \"stores similar anatomical informtaion as electronic code\" (5). The research going along with this system shows there are \"action units\" within facial structure that signifies the movement of one or more muscles. Each of the six basic emotions that Dr. Paul Eckman has classified are all associated with the facial muscles. It is important for students to know these muscles and learn how they work. According to Eckman, \"your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises eyebrows when you're surprised\" and the \"orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger\" (3). This up-to-speed technology comes up with information that no human could, but helps students become knowledgable of how it works. Society is based on technology as of right now, and is the forefront of the younger generations, so this software should partake in a students learning.\r\n\r\nEmotions are something that are unbelievably hard to understand when coming from other people. One typically cannot tell how a person is feeling just by the way they are looking, unless they are close with them personally. Being able to understand someone's emotions will benefit them and their surroundings, as they can get help if they are down or can have reassurance if they think someone is mad at them.",
        "Do you belive in the supernatural or in acient civilizations, like aliens? Well I don't. In the passage \"Unmasking the Face of Mars\" there are two major opinoins on if there once was a civilization on Mars or if it was a natural landform. Based on text and factual evidence I belive that the \"face\" on Mars is a natural land form.\r\n\r\nFirst, \"on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.\" (10) \"Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoulotion.\" (10) Which Means they got the best picure they could.\r\n\r\nIn addition, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digitial image 3 times bigger than you the pixel size. (11) \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see what they were!\" (11) This proves that if it was a civilization, then it would have other structure too, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\nMy last peice of evidence comes from (paragraph 12), \"The picture acutally shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa0landforms common around the American West.\" \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Gavin.\" \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" (12)\r\n\r\nFinally, to oppose my argument the article also stated that, \"The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.

        "Driverless cars are coming and are closer than we think. Driverless cars are a phenomenal idea becauase they're innovative,all major car compaines are moving toward the driverless way and they're safe. This essay will disscuss these three reasons on why driverless cars are a phenomenal idea.\r\n\r\nFirst driverless cars are overwhelmingly innovative. It states in the passage \"Originally,many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads\". This is putting into perspective that even futurists didn't believe it was possible but Google has achieved this monument to perfection. Also in the ariticle it says \"founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream\". As the original founder of this project he has even reached the level of innovation that he has been striving and working for since 2009.\r\n\r\nSecondly alot of major car companies are striving for making their product driveless. For example in the passage it conveys \"Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time\". This is shownig how a major car company as innovative as Tesla is going to release a self driving car of their own. In that same paragraph it informs \"Mercendes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020\". Showing that even some of the luxury brands and the major car compaines are releasing a driverless car. Showing how they agreee with where the future is going and how much of a phenomenal idea it is.",
        "In this article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", the author talks about the aspects of driverless cars. To me driverless cars can be a bad thing. Just think about a car running on its own without a driver. That's basically impossible and also scary. I feel like cars should always have a driver inside them.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars can sometimes be a danger to people. If the car was completly driverless then it wouldn't need human skills. A driverless car shouldn't be able to use human skill. It should be able to do everything when needed to. The driver must remain alert when in a driverless car. They must keep their hands near the steering wheeling at all times to be ready to take control.\r\n\r\nDrivers would get bored just sitting around waiting for the car to alert them. Why would anyone want to buy a driverless car isn't in full control? People shouldn't make driverless cars becasue it could probably hurt someone. What happens if the technology fails? Whose fault would it be if it does fail? In case of an accident, there should be laws. Where would they sell these cars.\r\n\r\nIf the technology ever fails I feel like it would be the drivers fault. It would be their fault simply because they were so eager to try out the driverless car. They thought it would be so perfect to try it out. But then it would the inventor's fault because they were the ones that invented it.",
        "In the article \"Driveless Cars Are Coming\" the author talks a lot about how driveless cars could be a good thing and a bad thing. My thoughts on driveless cars are negitive. My thoughts are only negitive because anything could go wrong.\r\n\r\nOne of my thoughts on driveless cars are what if you have to suddenly stop in an unknown place how whould the car know it has to stop. A driveless car could be or maybe would be the cause of most car accidents. Everyone wouldnt even know how to work it because we wernt born with it. It would maybe be a great technology but most people wouldnt be confortable doing or not doing something they havent did all their lifes.\r\n\r\nAnother one of my thoughts on driveless cars is when i think about a driveless car i think about all technology and there isnt a 100% chance that there wont be a malfunction. Most technology makes mistakes of has some type of glitch, so why would you put your life in the hands of a driveless car.\r\n\r\nOn earth, people are becoming lazier as the day goes by all the technology we have barely makes us want to move off of our couches. Which would also be another negitive thought about driveless cars.",

Be you and if you want to try something new like studying Venus because if its a worthy persuit it can be good for you because you may learn new things you have never been able to learn. What if one day they send you into space or Venus to check out you can not be scared because there are times when you get scared and that messes all your plans up and you back out.

        "With all of the advances that car companys are making there is no doubt that driverless cars are on their way to Americas roadways. The author of this article makes some good points supporting driverless cars, but they also makes some good points that lead me to be against them. I have not seen enough evidence to prove them safe.\r\n\r\nRight now we get some comfort when we see a large SUV barreling down the road, at least there is a human in charge of the vehicle that is hopfully paying attention to the driving task ahead of them. I just don't believe that a computer would be able to make all of the logical descisions neccasary for safe travel. Lets take interstate driving for example. When driving on the interstate you have to be able to quickly make decisions when someone darts in front of you, or when to pass somebody. Computers wouldn't be able to make these decisions on thier own.\r\n\r\nNow lets look at it from a legal view. The author covers some of the legal issues in paragraph nine. In the very last sentence of paragraph nine the author asks \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- The driver or the manufacturer?\" Thinking logically I have arrived at the conclusion that it would be the manufacturers fault. The driver isn't the one driving, it's the manufacturors system that is in control. This can only lead me to believe that if the manufacturer is the one that made the system, if it fails the manufacturer is to be held responsible for the failure.",
        "While it is incredible that Prof. Thomas Huang has developed this mechanism to read anyone's emotions, it should not be implemented in the classroom. As humans, we have the basic right to freedom of speech which allows us to speak our opinions, but it also allows us to keep some things to ourself, and that includes our emotions.\r\n\r\nSome peole are better at reading emotions and body language than others, and nobody can do anything about that. But sometimes students conceal emotions from teachers for reasons, and sometimes kids just want to figure out how to perform tasks on their own. If a student is taking an online course and appears confused, it's best to let them decide whether or not they need to be taught more about the subject or it they are jsut struggling with a certain aspect of it. Also, if a student's face is 45% concentrated and 55% confused, they may not want the computer to bombard them with a lesson and break their concentration, which would end up frustrating the student. In paragraph 6, the author says, \"Imagine a computer that knows when you\u2019re happy or sad.\" While it could be beneficial for a computer to know what emotions the students in the lesson are feeling, what would it do if the student was overwhelmed by emotions that weren't related to the lesson at hand? Woult the computer be able to decipher what emotions were related to the lesson and which were just carried over from their home life or other things?\r\n\r\nIn paragaph 6, the author says, \"Imagine a computer that knows when you\u2019re happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" there are already many people who are against the idea of personalized ads, and think they are an invasion of privacy.",
        "Driverless cars are too expensive, trivial, and dangerous to be developed for public use. The development of these cars would require extensive funding, and this money could be much better spent. Some of these cars would only be partially automated and would still require a capable driver at all times, so what would be the point? Finally, driverless cars would be concerning from a safety standpoint - would these cars really be able to safely maneuver out of dangerous situations?\r\n\r\nFirst, the development of driverless cars would be expensive. Automated cars require many sensors and cameras that regular cars do not need, and even with these sensors, the cars are not capaple of completely driving themselves. In order to achieve a reliable driverless system, all of our roads would have to have electricity or magnets installed, which even the article admits would be \"too expensive to be practical\". Furthermore, the money spent on developing these cars could be spent to help those who are less fortunate rather than creating new things for ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with driverless cars is the idea of cars that only assist the driver. These cars would drive most of the time, but they would, \"notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents\". These cars would certainly be helpful, but what would be the point of having a self-driving car if you still have to watch the road as if you were driving yourself? Some manufacturers talk of adding, \"in-car entertainment and information systems,\" but if the driver were focused on these systems, would they be able to react quickly enough if the car approached a dangerous situation?",
        "If you could buy a car that could drive you around, with you not having to do anything, would you buy it? Personally, I would not. There are to many things that could go wrong. We all know that technology can break down at times. Even our computers break down for no reason at times. So why let a car, that could end your life in a split second, drive you around? I wouldn't want to take that risk.\r\n\r\nIn the passage \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" they explain that even at times the driver has to take over. They said, \"the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" What if, one time, the car did not notify the driver or the driver falls asleep? This could end the drivers life and someone else's. Yes, in the passage they state \"the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.\" But, I know plenty of people, mostly teenagers, that would disconnect the wheel sensor. So again, why take this chance to end peoples life for some Driverless Car?\r\n\r\nIf we are going to have Driverless Cars then, they need to be a little safer before anyone can drive them. If we can't get our computers to work correctly sometimes, then why are we inventing Driverless Cars?",
        "The Face on Mars\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen the face on Mars? If so do you think it was a natural landform or alien made? So let's assume you think it is made by aliens and i think it wasnt. I think it wasnt because there have been things like this on earth but obviously not as big of a dent on earth. I personally think it was a natural thing like when clouds look like faces or random objects. People dont say clouds like that are made by aliens.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think it isnt alien made is because there are things on Earth comparable to the face on Mars. We don't think those are alien made. We also see clouds everday that look like faces or random objects so therefore there isnt a diffrence between the two. The only difference being clouds are in the sky and the face on Mars is on Mars.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you could also compare is the face on Mars to it the easter island heads. They are gigantic statues that kinda look like the face on Mars. A lot of people also say that those are alien made but other people could also argue they arent because they have an opinion. Most likely they will express there opinion too but it is a matter of opinion and no facts because there isnt way to tell if the face on Mars was made by aliens or not.",

I believe this because now and days you see that a lot of car accidents happen with texting and driving and also with drinking and driving. Now imagine how great it would be if those types of accidents would stop happening, well driverless cars are the answer. Now and days people can be very irresponsible and hurt others by their actions but these cars can help save lives and a lot of them. This can help keep pedestrians safe and even the drivers. Many deaths happen every year because of drivers not being able to be alert when driving, well with this type technology we can prevent this from happening. These cars will most likely be programmed to follow the law, as in mainting the speed limit and not doing illegal things on the road as in skipping a stop sign or a red light. These cars will also be able to help those who aren't able to drive like blind people, short people, and handicaped people these cars will be able to take them to their destination safely. These cars will be a great help to a lot of people who are irresponsible and to those with disadvantages. In conclusion I do believe they should develop these cars because it would be a great help to people.",

        "New software has been created to determine the facial expressions of students. It uses technology to give data as to what emotions someone is feeling such as happiness, sadness, and boredom. These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning. However, the use of software to determine the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is not valuable to the students learning experience.\r\n\r\nTo start, in order for this new technology to work, students woukld have to constantly be watched by cameras that read their expressions. This is said in the text when it says, \"Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements,\" (D'Alto 4). One can see from this that the students would always have to be watched and their facial movements would all be recorded. This could be an issue of privacy for some students if they do not want to constantly be recorded. It also makes it easy for outside threats to hack this system and watch students or get personal information from the videos. Emotion-recognition software can also be expensive for schools, especially since it doesnt work on normal PC computers. The text states, \" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" (D'Alto 7). This shows that normal computers that students would typically use cannot support this technology, making the school buy the technology that can support it. This would be a costly job and if the school cannot pay for it then the students would have to and some families may not be able to afford it. Lastly, students facial expressions may not directly correlate with the emotion they are feeling towards the lesson that they are learning.",
        "I see that you believe that the Face could mean that there are or were a sort of life form on Mars. This is easy to belive at first glance, but we decided to look further. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over this red planet. The MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed a natural landform. This concluded that there was no alien monument on Mars.\r\n\r\nBut many theorists, like yourself, stayed unconvinced. Again on April 8, 2001 another photo was taken. This time the photo was taken by Malin's team, and they used the camera's maximum resloution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This means that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. The image taken actually portrays a Martian version of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the American West.",
        "The technology emotional expression is helpful because now that we have that we can look back at old pictures and wonder. What was Abraham so mad about? Or why was George Washington so happy but sad about? This experiment can change the way we look at history.\r\n\r\nThis experiment can help us more understand the past. Like the Mona Lisa nobody knew she had all that emotion in her when she took that picture. Because her smile was so big it stood out. When really she was happy but had all these other emotions in her that we didn't know she had.\r\n\r\nThis can help students by doing projects on the person they picked and they can research a pciture and then use the experiment to discover their emotions at the time. This new experiment can change alot of wrong discovers that were made in the past. Now we can know more with the new emotional expressions.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to tell if some one is lying or telling the truth. It's so many celebrities that put on a fake smile to the press when really there's something going on behind closed doors. This new thing can help people that have problems because we can see how they really feel. Say if we used this in the school year book and we use it on a student that does abd in school or is always in trouble.",
        "I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it a really good program. You will see lots of different things that you probabaly have never seen before. Wouldn't that be cool? I was one and it was a lot of fun. You get to meet new people and see new things.\r\n\r\nSome things that are a downside are when you are on the ship and a storm comes you have to make sure everything is latched shut and close everything. You also have to make sure that no one or nothing gets thrown overboard. It almost happened to me once, I was a watchman on my second trip. My job was to check on all of the animals every hour. Well, one night I was doing just that and I slid down a slippery ladder. I thought that I was going to go overboard, my heart was racing as I shot feet first toward a big opening in the side of the ship. I thought I was going to die, but I didn't obviously cause I'm still here talking to you. Well, a small metal strip stopped my slide, keeping me from going overboard. It was the best moment of my life when that metal strip saved me.\r\n\r\nNow that that is over with I am goign to tell you some amazing places you might be able to go. These trips where amazing for a small town boy like me. I would have so much fun in the places that we would go.",
        "I think that using the Facial Action Coding System could be a valuable tool in the classroom. This technology could help teachers teach efficiently in a classroom. It could tailor the learning experience so that each student's feelings are interpreted and addressed properly. This could also help online learning systems by giving easier questions or explaining things with more depth when certain faces are made.\r\n\r\nThe facial expression for each emotion is universal. Different muscles make different faces to show different emotions. Facial muscle movement can even show mixed emotions. With the new technology a person's face is compared to and judged by neutral faces. This can help identify and distinguish specific emotions, and make it easier to get inside a student's head.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of using computers to determine feeling is being able to tailor learning to an individual's feelings. The computers can recognize feelings like disgust, confusion, and boredom. This way it can be known if a teacher's lesson becomes too cumbersome, or if the teacher doesn't explain things quite right. Then they can know when they need to slow down and take a little more time with the topic, and therefore teach students more effectively.\r\n\r\nOnline learning or learning from a computer would benefit as well. Teachers can identify different emotions in different students. Humans can sort of \"calculate\" different emotions ourselves. If a student is learning from a computer it can be difficult to adjust the lesson to the student's needs. If the computer can recognize different emotions then it could try to present the information in different preset ways. If the student is bored the computer could give a humorous example to explain the problem or make it more interesting so that the learning process is easier. If the student appears confused the computer could slow down and go over the past few things it just taught.",

In 2009, Google had already created a car that was almost completely independent and, many other companies such as General Motors had created similar cars. These cars have many unknown variables that still need to be worked out but, driverless cars will be a positive change towards the future.\r\n\r\nScientist have been working on creating a driverless car for years. As of 2009, Google created an almost independent car. The car could do almost anything. the downfall was that the car still relied on driver control in situations such as traffic construction zones. These cars have alert systems to alert the driver when human assistance is needed. Therefor these cars are still safe to operate but not completely independant.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the driverless cars being invented today have a great deal of sensors.\r\n\r\nThese sensors allow the cars to distinguish thier surroundings, giving the most amount of safety possible. These cars are also more fuel efficient and eco friendly. They will use less fuel and will be equipped with many safety features. These new features allow the car to see 360 degrees around the vehicle and keep the passenger as safe and comfortable as posible.\r\n\r\nAs of now, many of these cars still need human attention when driving. They are equipped with vibrating seats and sensors on the wheel to monitor that the human is alert.",

        "Twenty five years ago something very uncommon happened on our planet Mars. NASA sent a shuttle taht can take pictures of anything, NASA sent the shuttle out into space. The shuttle NASA sent out was called \"Viking 1\". Viking 1 was a shuttle that took (past tence) pictures of plantes. NASA sent the shuttle out to look for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. As the shuttle taking pictures it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. The Human face had a enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. Threw the cameras it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Those are some little details about the \"Human Face\".\r\n\r\nEven though i'm a scientist at NASA, some of my friends who were also scientist we all agreed it was probably it was just another Martian mesa, they were common around Cydonia, but this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. I was dissusing the \"Face\" with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. I was telling him (John) we unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" But now that the word got out people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. He was also saying \"Its evidence that evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" Me personally believed the Face was an alien artifact.\r\n\r\nAnd so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, so friends Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera which we called (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos.",
        "Driverless cars have always been a big idea for the future. However, there are some really important pros and cons for driverless cars. Driverless cars can be very dangerous to not only the individual driving, but also to everyone around. Perhaps driverless cars isn't such a good idea. Your biggest concerns would be the technology failing and the safety of everyone around it.\r\n\r\nSafety is the MAIN key to a driverless car. Since a driverless car would be driverless, not only the driver would need to be alert but everyone around it would need to be, which is common sense for any type of vehicle or transportation. Considering the fact that the human being is always in charge of an accident with a regular car. That woudn't be the case for a \"driverless car\". Now even though the driverless car have sensors and other types of monitoring to prevent accidents and disfunctions, who's to say the driver isn't paying attention when they need to be and something goes wrong. In paragraph 9 it talks about how traffic laws are wriiten to assume that the human is in control at all times. That's completely understandable, if the human doesn't do what he needs to do to make sure his manufacturer is working correctly, it would be his fault for not taking care of it.\r\n\r\nFor everyone else around a driverless car, would always be in great danger. No matter how well the car itself is functioning, you dont know if everyone else is paying attention to their own vehicle. Pedestrians around the driverless cars have no control over what it does. If something happens to a pedestrian, who's responsibility is that? If a sensor on the car isn't working properly, which it should be, there would be more deaths and injuries to people around the vehicle and to the person inside of the vehicle. The minor issues of a driverless vehicle could cause a huge problem.\r\n\r\nEven though having a driverless car seems like such a good idea, there could be many things to go wrong.",
        "Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is one of the brightest points of light in the sky... That is a good point to start an investigation.\r\n\r\nIt is called ''The Earth Twin'' because Venus is the most closest in density, size and distance too. Humans have sent a lot of spacecrafts to study a phenomenom related with the speed of the planets that are in our solar system, all of the times that humans have sent spacecrafts trying to stdy Venus they just got the destruction of them, that could be the reason of why Venus have not being touched in the past thirty years, that is why humans want to know new qualities, more than the ones that we already know.\r\n\r\nOne of the factors that makes Venus one of the most challenging planets to study is its thick atmosphere, which is composed of almost 100 percent of a kind of ''blankets'', under those ''blankets'' are clouds containing sulfuric acid. Humans just cannot go and walk in Venus as we did in the Moon, and that is because Venus has a lot of extreme environments, which are too different to any environment we can find in the Earth, these conditions are the insane temperatures, Venus has the hottest surface than any other planet in our solar system, not even Mercury has a surface like that. The temperature in Venus could reach a level of 800 degrees Fahrenheit which is a totaly unknown temperature for humans. Another extreme fact of Venus's environment is its atmospheric pressure which is more than 90 times greater that the pressure we experience in the Earth. But that is not all about Venus, the geology and weather that Venus presents include erupting volcanoes, earthquakes and sometimes it gets some lightning strikes.\r\n\r\nHumans are completly surprised by Venus and its environment today, because there are astronomers who could be totally sure about Venus having oceans and a few forms of life a long time ago, those who can be sure about it say that Venus still has some features similar to the Earth, some of them are valleys, mountains and craters.\r\n\r\nNASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus, it will be so complicated to do, but the astronomers say that is the only way to get more information of Venus, having humans in the surface of Venus they could take samples of rock, gas, or anything else. Astronomers say that if they really want to know more about Venus they have to be there and experience all its difficulties despite the risks. They take all of its difficulties as challenges. Many others astronomers are working in machines that could be send to Venus, maybe that is because they think that step the surface of Venus is completly impossible.",

It was a unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, (He mentioned in paragraph 4) not only did I help people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe,China, and Acropolis in Greece which was special. I also got to care for animals (as mentioned in paragraph 6). Helping out at aunt Katie's farm prepared me for hard work but not for the dangers of the sea (as mentioned in paragraph 7).\r\n\r\nWhen I was serving as a nightman on my second trip, I still checked on the animals every hour (as mentioned in paragraph 7). One rainy night I injured my ribs but didn't fly off the ship and though I still couldn't work for a few days I was happy to be alive (as mentioned in paragraph 7). I had a fun time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The other cowboys and I played baseball and Volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been housed (as mentioned in paragaph 8). I'm grateful for the opportunity and I t made me more aware of other people of other countries and their needs (as mentioned in paragraph 9).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion should join this program because of the sight seeing and fun you'll have.",

A good exapmle of a question that most readers will thnk of would be \"Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?\"(Paragraph 4). This question not only supports his claim but also gains the readers trust knowing that the author is very informed about what he/she is talking about and knows what the readers want to know about.

Driverless cars may in fact reduce collisions with other cars due to human error, but computer errors can just as likely occur.

Drivers that use driverless cars would not have enough experiance behind the wheel to fix, or take over the car if needed.

This creation can help our world have safer roads, better environment, and could actually help our environment in many ways. With the correct technology and great intention, we could eventually live in a futuristic type of world like we have always seen in movies.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars aren't actually driverless quite yet, but they still need assitance in different occassions.

The conditions where it can't perform by itself is pulling out of drive ways or driving around complex traffic. These cars still allow one to drive but it also is a way for people to sit back and just enjoy the ride. So although we might not have complete driverless cars, we have already been proven that it is possible top have a car that drives safely by itself.\r\n\r\nSince we have seen that these cars can perform safely without an accident occurring, think of how many less accidents would occur. Many lives have been lost due to drunk driving, reckless driving, and even texting while driving. With these cars that perform on their own, people will no longer have to drive under the influence. People will now have the chance to text or call while in the car, and it will eliminate more accidents from occurring by this type of reckless driving.",

While these conspiracy theorist go with the common opinion about it floating around, and do no reasearch at all. The conspiracy theorists think that may NASA is hiding the fact that aliens have made this from the public because it may harm their budget. Taking this to 1976, camera resolution wasn't high enough to take good high quality photos yet because the technology was behind. The picture was blurry and it was one of those, \"you've got to see it to believe it\" moments because nothing could be made out from it. This is probably where that \"aliens made this\" conspiracy came from, the photo is so blurry looks as though some sort of alien space craft had landed here or the doing of aliens for artwork.

        "I think there should be driverless cars in the development and hope there is a legitiment product for one. For one it may be safer than actual drivers driving a car. It can save alot of natural resources for gas.\r\n\r\nThe big concern for the whole article is that if the automated car can be safe and I can tell you that the manufacturer's are working on it. According to the text: \"some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Sush displayscan be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to drivers to text aith a cell hpone.\"",
        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author claims that studying Venus is worth the possible risks and dangers, because as science evolves technology and experiments should evolve too. Venus, also called Earths's \"twin\", could be a planet that was actually visited by humans and make the innovation of technology even greater.\r\n\r\nThe author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers, because Venus could have been at one point our most Earth-like planet and may eventually become a planet that is able to sustain life. Venus had at one point contained similar characteristics like that of Earth, and could possibly be an opportunity for sending a human to another planet which could advance technology enough to sustain life there. The author states, \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit\". The fact that Venus could have possibly sustained life in the past means that there is a slight window of opportunity for it to sustain humans and be \"our nearest option for a planetary visit\" again.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System created by Dr. Paul Eckman, it is a man-made computer, in which it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Many would say that this new break in technology is useless, but there is more that meets the eye when it comes to the Facial Action Coding System. This coding system can read the emotional expressions of any student in a classroom! This is extreamly useful as it can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, it will then modify the lesson to fit the needs of that student, and human communication is nonverbal so therfore the computers are trained to react like a human in any situation.\r\n\r\nWhen a child is sitting in a classroom with many other students while the teacher is explaining a lesson plan, they might fall to boredom or simply be confused. Many students could say, that they have at one point or another felt overwhelmed by a certain lesson in their classroom. The Action Coding System can, as said by Dr. Huang, \"..recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" Imagine having a computer that would allow you to read into the emotion of a student. This device could be the greatest asset to any teacher. Many students will subside their emotion for the thought of being cast out by their peers for not understanding a lesson, now with the Action Coding System created a student will not feel the pressure of being discriminated against, and teachers have a reliable source of technology to make sure their classrooms are being used to the best of their ability.\r\n\r\nAs well, the Action Coding System not only can scan a student's emotions, but when it finds a student confused or bored, it will modify the lesson for the child. As said by Dr, Huang, \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This piece of technology can even modify a lesson plan for a child struggeling to understand the curriculum or a student who struggles with ADHD. A teacher with this device could always know what is happeing in her class and how his/her students are feeling.",

The author has different details and has found them.\r\n\r\nThe author talks about different stuff how our sister plant is so inhospitable\". Scientists also see and search what's going on in the world and in the planets. I think it's good that we know some of these stuff so we know in the future that can happen. If you don't know none of these details you can search stuff online.\r\n\r\nIt's also good knowing these stuff because it's better to know them. Scientists do a lot of researching that's going around the world and earth. Also Venus is worthy to know what dangercan happen. It can get to 170 degrees Fahrenheit the air will be close to the area.\r\n\r\nThe solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels.

        "In this article Driverless Cars are coming i agree with them. It would be nice to have cars that can help us drive or even drive for us. First that would be really good for peoplewho drink and drive. Then it would be the same for\r\n\r\npeople who are tired from work or an type of activity and cant drive because there just so tired.Plus i feel its a good investment in our country, instead of getting a taxi.\r\n\r\nFirst i think its a good idea because the people who drink and drive now have this driverless car to take them home. There friends dont have to worry if he or she made it home safetly cause there is this car that is\r\n\r\nkeeeping them safe from driving. They wont hurt anybody or themselves. Also if they do try to drive and put there hand on the wheel maybe they should have the car sense there is too much alchahol in there system.Like how paragraph 4 said that \"they will needed a\r\n\r\nwhole lot of sensors\" for the car so maybe then can put a sensor like that put in the car.\r\n\r\nThen the people who are tired from work and from doing something very tiring or the people who cant see even at night\r\n\r\nand they suufer from driving and they end up up a car crash so the car can help\r\n\r\nthem out a lot because many people suffer from not seeing in the dark when they drive. Or when you\r\n\r\ngo grocery shopping and your reallly tired and cant really much for yourself the car is there for you to take you home.\r\n\r\nLast, its a good investment for our country in paragraph 1 they mention that\r\n\r\n\"the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibllity than a bus.\" so i feel why not take up that offer when there is so many companies out there that offer a taxie system, so we can replace all of that and save more money in this counry and possibly other contries.",
        "Why do you think the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit disregarding the danger that is being presented.\r\n\r\nVenus is the closest planet to Earth which is why it is referred to as the Earths ''twin''. Most people study geography which is all around the world such as Earth. Meanwhile, others are studying or learning more about venus . Such as , venus is more dangerous because of how close it is to the sun and carbon dioxide that revolves around it.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is also an effect on how dangerous it is .\r\n\r\nEven though mercury is closer to the sun venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet . This can result in erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes .Others on the other hand are fascinated by Venus because it has been the most Earth - like planet in our solar system . Earth is covered of different bodies of water and that could support different forms of life. Venus a very long time ago ,was also covered in large oceans which help others to adapt to . Planetary visiters put the option of venus out there because of its physical features such as valleys,mountains and craters. The NASA is sending people who are intrested in studying space and planets to visit Venus.\r\n\r\nThe people who are going to traveling on ship will not see as much due to the dense atmosphere .You aren't going to be able to take sample of things from a distance because of the risk that will be taken . Risk like taking resources from the planet can harm you . They are making different ways to travel to venus so it would be worth the time period and not limited.\r\n\r\nThe authors has used a good choice of words by saying ''that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presesnt . The trip would be very observative and informational .",

Do you think that the face is actually a face?\r\n\r\nA few days after NASA sent Viking 1 to Mars to take pictures, they got back photos of a face. Not just any face, it was a human face. Not only is this crazy, it's impossible. It's impossible because we spent a lot of time and money reaserching if humans can go live on Mars. And it has been scientifcally proven by us that no human can live on Mars, so for that reason I don't know how that human face got there in the first place.\r\n\r\nI know that some people think that maybe aliens are the ones who made the face, and you may be right. In some cases though, while we we'er reaserching, we would have noticed already. What we think it is is a natural landform. I know that it sounds crazy, but it is a possibility. It would make more sense if it was a natural landform.\r\n\r\nIf you can't decide if it's a face, aliens, or just a natural landform, then let me take some details from the article to support my idea.",

        "We humans have been trying to discover aliens for more than a million years. Why have we not found them yet? We have been up in space multiple times and we have had yet another more multipe times sent space robots that went into orbital. So ask your self this question why have we not found aliens yet?\r\n\r\nI think due to evidence that it is a natural landform. I think it is a natural landform because in paragraph one it states that \"...when it spotted the shadowly likeness of a human face.\" When I read this I then concluded that it only really looked like a human because of the shadows that make up the \"eyes, nose and mouth\" in which makes this rock figure looking as if it has a face. I do think that is a natural rock landform because God created the earth so that only people would live on earth. Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible. Another example of why that the \"face\" on Mars is a natural landform is because it states in the text on paragraph seven that \"There was no alien monument after all.\" This is poroving that even scienctists have conculuded that there was no landform on mars. Then on April 8, 2001 the space station found to \"face landform\".",

It would probably say how they feel out loud, and maybe someone doesnt want to be pointed out. \"You can tell how someone feels by their actions and look on their face\", I don't think they'd need a \"robot\" to understand how someone feels in that exact moment. I think teachers or whoever themselves should go up to that person and have a proivate conversation, some teachers see the facial expressions on some students and wont bother to ask. I feel like the technology would be expensive as well and they would need a lot of them. It would just be a waste of money. Plus, it goes by your facial expressions. I don't believe it would actually tell you how you feel.",
        "For someone who does not believe in aliens, this is only but a mere coincidence. We have no facts to prove that it WAS made by aliens, furthermore there being a whole civilization of aliens living on mars. There are many landforms as this one on Mars, and even on Earth, that happen to show some type of face, or object that would rather look man-made or even \"alien\" made. Just because there is a landform that has a shape, and look of a face, doesn't neccessarily mean that there is a life-form living on Mars. For there to be some type of life-for on Mars, yes, it would most benefit NASA, by finding out what is that life-form, how its living, and so on. But for someone to think that alien life-forms made this landform of a face, you can't really say that aliens have done so without having the proper information that shows, \"aliens\" have done so.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, from the photograph, we can say that yes, it does look like a face. But at this time, technology wasn't at it's highest. Since technology hadn't been as high tech as it is now, we could assume that, of the photo were taken now, yes, it'd be much more different, more defined. More so, there had been more photos taken on April 5th, 1998, with photos sharper than the original, being said that there had been no alien monument after all.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this argument, you could still go on saying how aliens are real, and how they created this landform.

        "Driverless cars being brought into the world sounds like a dream come true, no more worrying about horrible car accidents, or having the urge to text and drive at the same time, right? Wrong. Having driverless cars may sound like a good idea, but to me they're not. Especially when a persons' fate in being messed with.Plus bringing driverless cars into mind would also bring an even lazier world, and people that work as driving instructors would be out of a job. Having driverless cars will lead to humans becoming lazier than they already are, twice as many car accidents as there were before, and some lots of people around the world wouldn't have a job.\r\n\r\nCar accidents can happen anywhere at anytime, and they are not a pretty sight to look at. Most car accidents happen during \" work traffic\" and on the highway. Now think of how many more car accidents would happen if we have \"smart\" cars driving by themselves. The damge would be horrific. In the passage, paragraphs 7-8, they talk mainly about how even though these are computer engineered cars, they still would need human assistance if nessecary. A line from paragraph 7 says \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselevs, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" This sentence showed that even though these are smart cars, humans still have to be alert at all time. But what if the technology in the smart car refuses to provide smart alerts and warnings to the human? This would lead to a huge accident. And since the law doesn't know wheather to blame it on the manufracturer or the driver, its completely pointless to take the risk of putting these cars on the road.",
        "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" was a interesting factual article to read. My opion on driverless cars is they're not a good idea. I am against driverless cars. My reasons for this are an increasing rate of accidents, technology failing, and the cost. In the following paragraphs are reasons why I am against the ideal of driverless cars.\r\n\r\nStarting off, my first reason for being against driverless cars was the increasing rate of accidents. Not all drivers pay attention to the road while driving (especially teens) and riding in a driverless car, coming into a situation that requires a human being to take control of the wheel can lead to accidents if they're not paying attention. The rates of car accidents are already high till this day, just imagine how high the rate would be having driverless cars. It may not even be the drivers fault, a glitch can happen with the car causing it to get into a accident injuring somebody, as said in passage 9; who's fault would it be then? The person or the manufacturers fault? That is my first reasoning opposing driverless cars.\r\n\r\nNext, my second reason was the technology failing. We live in a society where technology advances EVERYDAY, but there is always a complications with technology. Updated technology isn't always perfect. For instence the computer system in the car could crash, shutting off the whole car, there might be a hay wire causing the car to spin out of control, causing an accident, and even a more dangerous situation the car could explode or catch on fire due to the technology. An example of today's most updated piece of technology that went bad is the \"Hoover Board,\" many people could just be riding on it, and it could burst into flames. The same thing could happen with driverless cars.",

So this is a not a good option to used in a clasroom because if you fells happy, or sad, the teacher can ask you if yor are mad because acording with the computer you are.\r\n\r\nOr your friends see the program that says you are happy, but yourself is sad, your friend will be start to joke with you and, you do not liked, maybe they will be have problems.",
        "Venus is possibly the closest to Earth in size and density then and other planet. Which, makes you belive that just maybe, us humans can live on Venus just as we do live on Earth. Even tho Venus is very similar to our Earth it is very different. For example, Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Even the surface is affected and can average 800 degrees Farenheit. Even though these conditons are too extreme for our human kind. We can possibly create something or discover something greater that can withstand all of those extreme enviorments.\r\n\r\nEarth has an abundant of shapes and sizes of clouds. Not only do we have clouds that not only look beautiful, we also tend to have clouds that can harm us. Between a mixture of fog and rain it creates smog,which, can harm our skin. Not only does Earth have clouds, Venus does too. But Venus has clouds that can potentially kill all of human kind or melt through many types of metal. Venus has these very high corrosive sulfuric acid clouds in the atmosphere that would be a big problem for us humans to explore Venus.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, all of these conditions on Venus doesnt have to be as problem as long as we can create or discover something to counteract the conditions.",
        "Driverless cars have both a postive and negative side. It can help people or it can harm them. Those who invented driverless cars had a vision on making it easier for people, but are they really making it easier? My position on driverless cars is neutral. I think it can benefit us but also take us down.\r\n\r\nMany people may be confused on what driverless cars means, in my point of view they're cars that drive you to your destination without you having to do anything but getting in the car. Google confounder Sergey Brin's definition is different. Driverless cars to him are those who still need human assistance. Paragraph 7 states \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills...\". The Google car tells the driver when it's time to take over.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 2 it says \"Their cars have driven up to half a million miles without a crash...\" it may be safe but also dangerous if you don't know how to control it. Humans can take over if needed to and the way these cars are invented they need a lot of sensor for it to work, but sensors aren't anything new. In paragraph 7 it says \" While the driver watches the road, the car watches\r\n\r\nthe driver.\" saying the driver stills need to be on alert if anything is needed. The car and the driver are basically friends helping each other make it to the destination safely.\r\n\r\nThe thing to question is if an accident occured with a driverless car who's fault would it be? The drivers or the manufacturer? The manufacturer wouldn't want any problems and neither would the individual. They even quetioned who's fault it would be in paragraph 9 because they don't know the answer.If it affects the individual and they are the ones that got hurt it wouldn't even cross my mind to get one of these cas.",

        "I am against driverless cars being made. I think it will be too dangerous. It's cool that they are being made, but it will not end well. There are too many things to worry about with them. I think it's a bad thing because there are dangerous drivers out there, there are many road hazards, and weather conditions can make it even more dangerous.\r\n\r\nSome drivers are already making the roads more hazardous. They do things like speed, illegal turns, and do not use blinkers. With a human driver behind the wheel, if they see this they will most likely avoid the person the best they can, but what will a driverless car do. It might not be able to detect them so if it makes a turn, not knowing about the wreckless driver, it can cause an accident. The car can follow the rules of the road, but without human instincts, it's just waiting to get hit. This can very bad and effect a lot of people's thought about purchasing one of these vehicles.\r\n\r\nIt says in paragraph 7 that the driver must be ready to drive, just in case the car approaches a work zone, but what about small hazards. While the feature alerts them about work zones, it doesn't say anything about alerting the driver about a pot hole or dangerous material in the road. If it's driving in a small city, there could be some kind of hazard that needs a human to know how to avoid it. How would the car know to alert them if it hasn't seen anything like it before? It can alert for simple things, but for things like pot holes, it's better just to have someone behind the wheel instead of risking falling into the hole because the car didn't alert you to take over.\r\n\r\nDriving in bad weather can still be a problem. In paragraph 5, it states how it could react better than a human, stopping individual wheels and making it a lot less likely to skid out, but its not fullproof.",
        "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. These cars have been thought of in 2009 and have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash. The negative way is that most people will still have to be alert and this will cost more money, and depending on the crash of both veichle and drive we will not be able to fiigure out who has done it.\r\n\r\nMost people are having a hard time focusing on the road just because of texting or being on the phone with others. There were positive ways of the driverless cars,but there are limits these cars can face.\r\n\r\nThere are some positive ways of the driverless cars. In 2009, google cars has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions. These cars read the positive and negative polarity as messgae in the binary code.There were also sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes, they have become more advanced in the pass ten years. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer. Driverless cars will give the driver more time to text and finish phone calls with others.

They decided that it was another Martian mesa which were common around Cydonia.\r\n\r\nA few days after, NASA unveiled the image for all people to see. When they released the photo, the caption was \"huge rock formation.\" Some of the scientists say that the rock formation looks like a face. They said \"formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" An author later decided that the Face would be a great way to get the public's attention and attract them to Mars.\r\n\r\nAfter the Face was released to the public, it became a pop icon around the world. the Face appeared in Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. In the passage it says, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" This is evidence that NASA wanted to hide from the public. Some say that the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look.

        "I am for the development of smart/driverless cars. I have chosen to support these cars because they will use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus, they can sense the road and dangers better, and the cars require little human attention.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the cars will potentially replace taxi services. I think this will be a great idea because while you would still have to pay for the service, there is no human element of error. If there is an element of error, however, you will be the one at fault because you are the only passenger and driver. I believe the replacement of the traditional taxi service is a good thing.\r\n\r\nThe smart cars are good at sensing dangers on the road ahead. Because the cars have technology that can even start to turn on the brakes before the driver can, the driver will be safer and does not have to respond as quickly. The \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" is a good development because the driver must still remain alert but the car does most of the work.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think the smart cars are a good idea to develop because they allow the driver to be safe in a vehicle that they are not in full control of.",

        "Is the face on Mars the face of a new discovery in our universe? When a face was discovered on Mars, the idea of it was quite controversial. Generally speaking, the face on Mars was just a pop icon, not a sign of life. The face on Mars was proven to be a simple landform because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to determine, there were no signs of any civilization, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. The Face on Mars was just a pop icon and a skeptic's thought, not a sign of martian life or civilization.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to find evidence, when all they found was a natural landform.\r\n\r\nThe Red Planet was very cloudy that time of year, and theorists believed that the haze was hiding any martian evidence or civilization. However, it is not easy to target Cydonia, because of Mars' natural orbit and the fog and haze Mars receives every so often. So, in 2001, NASA sent the Surveyor back up to Mars to take pictures and investigate.\r\n\r\nWhen the photos were taken, the photos were discerned three times bigger than the pixel size, and no signs of civilization appeared.",

This from of technology is unpresidented their is nothing else out there like it. This Facial Action system have many uses that can be aplied to schools, art, and law enforecment. This would help teachers to be able to see what emotions that this person is having because it is important what your students are trying to learn.\r\n\r\nIn a school where you are teaching math you would like to know what a student was thinking Dr. Huang said that \"when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" you would be able to tell with the Facial Action Coding System.

These classroom computers will be able to tell us what we fell about the subject so lets say we are confused and the teacher knows that he could explain what is being taught to you in a different way so that you get it. The instruct can also see if you are bored so he can tell you to snap back into it or let the class take a little break.

        "I am personally against the idea of driverless cars. Some people are already dangerous behind the wheel as it is. I don't think a computer would do any better behind the wheel. Dirverless cars can be very dangerous and I think people would be better off not being lazy and driving themselves where ever they needed to go.\r\n\r\nOne reason that I am against driverless cars is that they are not 100% driverless. There are still issues that the car can't handle on it's own and will require the driver to take over. Driverless cars can be very dangerous because if the car would ever require the driver, and it fails to alert the driver in time, there could be fatal consequences. Drunk drivers could also try to take advantage of the fact that the car would be driverless and have the car drive itself. But if he driver were to be too drunk to take over, it could casue a very bad accident.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that I am against driverless cars is that they would be compter dependent and would run on it's own. And every skilled programmer or hacker would know that you would be able to hack the computer driven car to do what ever they wanted it to. Hackers can already hack a lot of vehicles as it is, they can send codes to a smart vehicle to unlock and even start the car without owning or having the key to the car. There are way too many dangerous things that could possibly happen with that to list. Hackers could change the course of the vehicle to any given location, they could make the car crash itslef, and they could make the car failt to alert the driver and every one would blame either the driver or the car.",

Not all teacher or staff can tell, but just looking at the students mouth or orbicularis tighten around their lips should show that they are angry or happy.

        "For many years, researchers have stared at the Mona Lisa. They have made countless observations and have even created this new technology that detects her emotions through facial recognition. Creator Prof. Thomas Huang has named this the Facial Action Coding System. This may not seem very important in the outside world, but the use of Facial Action Coding could be very beneficial in classrooms because it could understand the student's frustration and confusion and would modify the lesson to better fit the student, counselors could use it ot help determine how a student is truly feeling, and it would help teachers better understand the students who rarely talk in their class.\r\n\r\nFacial Action Coding could be benificial in classrooms because the technology could understand the student's frustration and confusion and modify the lesson to better fit the student. In schools all around, students are starting to give up. They get too angry at their homework and decide that they don't want to work on it anymore. The problems don't change--but with the Facial Action Coding System, the problems and even the lesson itself could change and become easier for the student. This would allow for the student to wrap their mind around the concept that was given to them. In the article, Dr. Huang states in paragraph 6, \"'A classroom computer could recognize when astudent is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'\" This quote tells its readers that that is what Dr. Huang wants this new technology to do. Teachers have to follow a guideline and a lesson plan; they have to be on track as to what the students are learning. Dealing with almost fifteen to twenty students a class, the teacher cannot physically help a student one-on-one all of the time. The Facial Action Coding System, however, would be able to.",
        "A computer reading your emotions? In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smila\" the author talks about how Facial Action Coding System is able to read emotions and how it may help students in the classroom. This technology in a classroom will not be beneficial because it is costly, may distract students, invades privacy, and may lead to ineffective learning.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 7 the author states \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile\". The average home PC's price ranges from about $200 USD to $500 USD. Since the average home computers can not handle these algorithms then the school must purchase higher end computers which will be very costly since every student will need one. Also every student travels throughout the school so the school must be able to purchase laptops with this advanced hardware and software so that the students will be able to use them in every class they attend.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 6 of the article the author states \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" and \"then it could modify the lesson\". When in a lesson at school not every student will enjoy the lesson, which will cause them to have a bored or even tiresome expression. Having this expression will cause the computer to attempt and make the lesson more intresting; but what if the student is still bored? The computer will keep trying to modify the lesson which could cause it to lead away from the original goal of the lesson so much that the student is no longer focused on the original topic.\r\n\r\nHaving a computer constantly reading your emotions will invade on your privacy. Paragraph 6 states \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" \"Then it could modify the lesson\". When detecting the student is bored or confused it will have to relay this information to the teacher letting them know that due to the student's emotion that it will be modifying the lesson to accomodate them. This means that when a student may be having a bad day or may just be in a bad mood that it will recognize that and store that information so that the teacher can know.",
        "Driverless cars should not be allowed in today's day and age because they are a safety hazard to not only the driver, but also to passengers and pedestrians. They are too much of an invitation to look at a cell phone or to get distracted by something else, such as a child in the back seat. They can cause wrecks and fatalities to skyrocket. Driving a vehicle is something that should be monitored at all times. When operating a vehicle, you must always be alert for not onlt your safety, but everyone else's.\r\n\r\nThe media has long been fascinated with vehicles that can drive themselves, but have they thougth out the idea entirely? Since 2009, Google has made cars that can drive independently under certain conditions. However, these cars are not totally driverless. They alert the driver when pulling in and out of driveways, driving through construction, traffic issues, and accidents. This can lead to distraction and not knowing what is going on around you. Adding to this, it can cause a leap in accidents and fatalities caused by these death machines.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, BMW announced their development of \"Traffic Jam Assisstant\". This is a vehicle that can drive on its own at speeds of up to 25 mph but has touch sensors to make sure the driver has his or her hands on the wheel. This shows that this car is only good for certain residential areas, and not highways or interstates where speed limits can reach up to 70 mph. Also, a driver can fall asleep at the wheel and not even realize it when it's time to be alert. This can cause major accidents in which legal battles can occur against manufacturers and individuals.\r\n\r\nAdding to issues above, some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. These diplays can be turned off when the driver takes the wheel, but this also allows drivers to get distracted and television instead of driving.",
        "Personally i am for driverless cars because with these cars if a accident were to ever occur the car would prevent it from happening which would prevent lots of deaths from texting and driveing from hit an runs. It would also keep the driver protected and also other drivers on the road protected. And also the sensors on the car modify when you are to close to a object or are going to hit a object before it is going to happen. And also the dubbed LIDAR use laser beams to form a constant updateing 3-D model of the car's surroundings with this combination the input is necessary for the driverless to mimic the real skill of a human at the wheel. And with the assistance and help of google the GPS his able to connect to google maps to navigate the driverless car to it's destination. With the sensors on and in the car drivers assistance isnt a problem, with the antilock brakes the is willing to stop when something is blocking it or is comeing at it with a equal speed. With more roadside assistance from google you can connect your cell phone to the car and answer the phone as you please and still be able to safely drive on the road.\r\n\r\nWith some of the assistance there is another added one its called \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but the special touch sensors makes sure the driver keeps hold of wheel. But not any of the cars made today so far has not accomplished makeing cars competely driverless they can break themselves, steer and also accelerate and all this tecnology keeps driver notified when on the road.\r\n\r\nThe car cant do all this on its on it needs human skill and assistance at the wheel along with it.",
        "Technology to read students emootions.\r\n\r\nI think that being able to read someone that way is really not okay. it sorta takes to personal space because there are reason these emmotions are not shown towards others and that normaly because nobody wants their feelings hurt or hurting sombody else. it doesnt feel good inside, being able to help sombody and help them keep there head up high and keep them walking tall.\r\n\r\nThe technology would be very interesting but i think it shoud only be used at certain times not to read what a student is feeling, use it on criminals and watch there change in mood threw there facial movements almost like a lie detector test. there is nothing in the article stateing the cons of this item its all about the pro's\r\n\r\nso i cannot really find much except to type what i think it should be used for. it would be some really great stuff if it ends up being used for the right thing t the right time so hope fully when somthings likes this happens they will use it wisely.",
        "Join the Seagoing program! The Seagoing Cowboys will be a great opportunity to have fun on the seas. You could go to different country's. I went to China and Europe. UURRA hired Seagoing cowboys to take care of young cattle,horses,and mules.\r\n\r\nI went on gondola in Italy and I took nine trips. That was the highest than any other Seagoing Cowboy. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you could beat my highscore. It might take long to go place to place but it is worth having fun on the boat so it doesn't get boring like that and this ain't where it ends. the fun doesn't stop here.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have fun going to different countrys. Then, have fun on board.\r\n\r\nMake up tournaments while you are going to a different place play different games like baseball, volleyball, and much more to do on board. Then, relax and read a book and sleep or take a nap and feed the animals and keep them clean so they don't be stinky and filfty. Keep yourself occupied and do something so you don't get bored and quit.\r\n\r\nThere are so many reasons to become a Cowboy. For starters, if you don't know how to do what a Cowboy does watch from other Cowboys or ask for help.",
        "Imagine what it would be like to drive past a car with no driver. The thought of driverless cars is really something to think about. But after reading the article, its clear that even though it shows some good qualities, driverless cars should not be an invention we soon incopperate into our daily lives.\r\n\r\nIn the article, the author makes some good points about some of the cons of driverless cars. Such as, the need for new traffic laws, accidents and the safety of the pedestrians and drivers of other vehicles. As of right now, the traffic laws are written under the assumption that a car is only a safe car if it has a human driver controlling it at all times, which makes it illegal in most states to even test cars that are run by computers.\r\n\r\nThe safety of these driverless cars is concerning as well. They do have many cameras and sensors as the article points out, but technology has not be perfected yet, so the sensors or cameras failing is a possible outcome of these cars. Then, a failed system in these cars could cause an accident. This comprimises the safety of other drivers and even pedestrians. Then, if a person is harmed in an accident with a driverless car, who is to blame? We have to make new laws just for the purpose of having driverless cars when we could just drive our own cars.\r\n\r\nAlso, a downfall of driverless cars is that people lose jobs. Driving services would no longer need human drivers to control the cars. This puts thousands of people out of jobs which raises the unemployment rate. Which then causes the government to need to give more money to support families becasue now someone from the family isnt bringing in money because they lost their job due to the driverless cars now transporting people instead of driving services using humans.",
        "I think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think you should becuase you get to visit places that you might never get to go to in life or to see things that you may no get a chance to witness.\r\n\r\nFor example in text, Luke found as much time as he can to have as much fun. Him and his cowboy friends played baseball, vollyball games, etc. They also had some tournaments, like fencing, boxing, reading whatever they can think of to pass time.\r\n\r\nSome more infomation from the article is The boat ride was fun and they had chances of seeing countrys like Europe and China and Greece. They took gondala rides in Venice, Italy, In the streets with water. If I was there i would enjoy myself more than other. Even in after the war in Europe was over left in ash and all they still went to the cities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion this shows that you should participate in alot of things, Because you will never kniw what will come your way.

        "I would have to say that I am in favor of moving forward and progressing towards driverless cars. There are quite a few reasons why I believe it's a great idea. After the idea is perfected, roads will be much safer, The cost of transportation will go down and also it could possibly make transporting on roads much faster.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this \"driverless car\" is quite astonishing, but once it is perfected it will open up doors to new oppurtunities in transporting on roads. For example, the car would be able to sense cars that a human could possibly not see. This would make the amount of car accidents go down.\r\n\r\nAlso, some states have already allowed computer driven cars on the road, as it says in the passage. This demonstates that these driverless cars are becoming safer everyday. It also says in the article that manufacturers believe the number of states to allow driverless cars is only going to continue rising as they advance there search for safer and possibly cheaper cars or solutions.\r\n\r\nOne other reason that i believe that these cars are a great idea is because it says that the cars can make for cheaper transportation. For example, it states in the article that Sergey Brin, cofounder of google, believes that the fuel amount needed in these futuristic cars will be half of what we use today. We would be able to do less harm to the environment by using less fuel. Also, Sergey Brin states that taxis would be more flexible and safe.",

        "Some people believe that this landform is an alien signal. Sure, it might look like one. That still doesent that it is one.\r\n\r\nThis object in space is just another accidental landform that happened to form there. There are not any alien landforms. There is no actual proof that the aliens have built this structure. Many strange occurances happen. This just happened to be one of them.\r\n\r\nThis is a common thing that occurs on mars. This is just a coincidence that it happened to look like it was an egyptian person. Up close this big rock is just a plain rock. It is just the sun shining on it that makes it look like it is a face. Thats all that it is.\r\n\r\nWithin our article on passage 9 it says that it was super hard to find this one. So that means that there is not that many of this oddly shaped landform. If you really think about it if there were really aliens there they would build more than just one.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be more proof that the aliens built that. This is also common on earth. Some people say that they can see a celebritty in there food. Really it is just some bad shaped food item.\r\n\r\nWe just need some cold hard proof of it. For us it just looks like a big rock that has been there forever.",
        "This Facial Action Coding System is weird. Why would anyone want to know what someone else is feeling or how their emotions are? To me that is personal information that I would want to myself. Plus I doubt that there would be a whoe lot a people who would put money into this to just see what emotion they are. That is just me though. What do you think about this idea? Would you spend time and money on it to just see your emotions and what mood you were in? I wouldn't.\r\n\r\nIf you keep reading from now on I am going to argue why this is a bad idea, because it is. I mean who would spend any type of time, effort, or money on this just to see what your emotions are or how you are feeling. Honestly who wants to know what facial expressions to use to show that you are happy, I think we already know how to be happy. We dont need a machine to tell us how to look happy. Obviously when someone is happy something great has happened to them or in their lives and they have a great big smile on their face. We also know when someone is mad, obviously when someone is mad they don't like to talk very much, and usually look like they are about to punch you in the face. For example in the text it shows you step by step what expression on your face we need to use to make us look happy, like no I know how to look happy or sad or mad, I don't need a machine to tell me how to do that.\r\n\r\nSo why do we need a machine to tell us these things when we already know them.

        "Students can feel various different types of emotions throughout the school day. School can be very stressful and overwhelming yet so enjoyable at the same time. When students are feeling a certain way, it may affect their ablity to learn. By incorporating the use of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom, teachers or even the computers themsleves could alter the learning style of the information being taught, making it customized and fitting for a specific student based on their emotions.\r\n\r\nEveryone is different when it comes to learning. Some students may be visual learners where as some students may be auditory learners. There are numerous, unique differences spanning from individual to indivdual which makes it hard on teachers when trying to teach a group of students the same material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System would make the job easier on teachers and prove helpful for students. For example, if a teacher could not visually recognize that one of thier students was tired, they may continue on with the way they are teaching the information, and that particular student may not grasp the concept being taught. With the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher would be able to recognize the students emotions and would have the opprotunity to alter her teaching method to somehting more engaging for the student. This would also prove helpful for the student that was feeling tired becasue they would now be able to become engaged with a modified style of learning.\r\n\r\nIf the Facial Action Coding System recognized that the students appeared to be happy and engaged, this could guide the teacher to continue teaching in that particular style and it would benefit the students trying to learn. Another way that this new technology could prove valuble in the classroom is if students were doing work on their computer or other elctronic device. If the Facial Action Coding System was installed into the learning devices that the students are using, the device itself could alter the learning style of the information given to fit the students needs.",

        "So you believe that the face on Mars was alien made. There are very many people that belive it is alien made to. There are also many people that believe it is not alien made. I believe that it is not alien made. I believe that the \"face\" is actually a natural landform.\r\n\r\nI believe that it is a natural landform because it is said that it looks like another landform on Earth. It is also shown on the pictures that NASA astronuats have taking that it is not alien made. The shadows have made the landforms craters look like facial features. There wasn't any proof of alien life on the face just theories made by consumers.\r\n\r\nPeople who believe it was made by aliens say that for many reason. The first reason is that hte first picture showed what look like a face staring back at you. Sencond reason is because they believe that we are trying to hide something from them. Also people want something to believe even if it doesn't have any realistic evidence. Last but not least the theory that aliens are out there has been around for ages so it wouldn't be wrong for them to believe that aliens did it.\r\n\r\nIt may look that way in the past but only because the images we captured then were not as inhansed as the ones now. The first photograph, made from the Viking 1, may have give the illusion that it was a face. Now that our technology is now modified we can see that is was just a landform.",
        "Using the same technology configured using the Facial Action Coding System into school technology would be a valuable tool in the classroom because the often hidden signals or vibes students show can often give teachers mixed feelings about the effectiveness of their lessons or how student are being treated emotionally by others, but this is still something that we must not make this something that interfears or plays with the personal feelings of the students. It would be a valuable addition to any classroom for its in-depth look into how the information is reaching the students, how they are reacting, and what the teacher can do differently to get the most out of thier lesson plans.\r\n\r\nEspecially in the mornings and end of the day, students' laziness, tiredness, or anticipation to get home can often disturb with how teachers percieve how their lesson plans are effecting the child. With the same Facial Action Coding System in our own school computers, online activities and assignments can track the emotional responses of the students while they work such as their attentiveness. Since this technology is, \"compared against a neutral face\", teachers will be able to witness firsthand their student's reactions. Oftentimes, early morning weariness or late school day excitement can fool the teacher's perception of the situation, but with the analyzing of the six basic emotions using \"video imagery\" of the, \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\", this technology would be able to offer to give an accurate conclusion to the student's reactions to each lesson.\r\n\r\nAnother commonly addressed situation is when students become \"confused or board\" with an assignment; both of these natural reactions show that the challenge level is not suited to the student's level. Teachers often want to offer help to the confused and challenge or entice board students, but these emotions are often not shown to the human eye. Especially with confused students, they hide this sense of confusion from the teacher to avoid embarassment. However, with this new technology, students who need more attention can be noticed. With the software's facial recogntion using minor muscle movements, it can make a conclusion without the student fully showing the emotion. With this in depth look, teachers are able to provide tutoring for those who need extra explaination and modify of their lessons for individuals who are not finding interest or challenge in the current lesson. With this technology, teachers will be able to realize how challenged each student needs to be even when they put up a ficade.",

We would like you to be our newest Seagoing Cowboy. After your first trip you might even want to invite your friends to become a Cowboy too.\r\n\r\nSeagoing Cowboys see new places, because of the work that they do. They must take food, animals, and supplies to countries who can not grow and thrive after tragic accidents. In the passage Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist become Seagoing Cowboys and work together on a boat traveling to Europe. In Europe the people had just fought in World War II and had no food or supplies, not even animals. So the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration sent supplies and animals on a ship to help the people in Europe.\r\n\r\nSeagoing Cowboys learn responsiblity by taking care of the animals and crew members on board their ship. In the article Luke must take care of horses, young cows, and mules by giving them water and food, cleaning the pens, and pulling hay and supplies from the lower decks. Seagoing Cowboys not only take care of animals they have to watch out for one another. In the passage Luke was almost knocked overvoard but thankfully a strip of metal caught him and his crewmates pulled him back aboard.\r\n\r\nThe people who do sign up to become Seagoing Cowboys get to travel around the world and learn about new cultures, eat new and interesting foods, and even get to see amazing landscapes and structures.

        "Have you seen the \"Face on Mars\"? If so, do you believe it is natural or created by alien activity? Many people believe the face is evidence of alien life however this is probably not the case. The Mars Global Surveyor ,a mapping spacecraft, has passed over the area few times. However the few times it has passed over there has been no evidence of any form of alien civilization. This led us to believe it is just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nThis all began when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting Mars. Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible landing sites for his sibling Viking 2. In the midst of doing so Viking 1 spotted what looked like a human face. This was extraordinary because it was on planet Mars! When the images were leaked it led the public to believe that this is evidence of life outside of Earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis might not be the case however. NASA believes that the face is just a natural landform similiar to a butte or mesa on that of Earth. There was a lot more evidence pointing towards the side of NASA but that didn't put peoples hopes down. Some of the public hoped and believed this was in some shape or form, evidence of extraterrestriel life.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of the \"Face on Mars\" that NASA had were actually kind of foggy. They were foggy because the Mars Global Surveyor had to get the photos through clouds. This then led people to believe that NASA was hiding something in the fog. They thought they were hiding the evidence of life. NASA, however wanted to show them this was not the case.\r\n\r\nNASA then ,a few years later, passed over the face on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, and rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. NASA eventually captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. This photo cleared up a lot of confusion.\r\n\r\nAs NASA studied the photograph, they came to realize that the Face was in fact caused by natural means. They then leaked the image to the public and cleared up confusion there too.",

The FACS would also help understand how the student is feeling in the classroom. It could aslo help in many ways by understanding how the students feel about like a lesson that is given or feel throughout the whole classroom time.

        "My years a Seagoing Cowboy was a great time. Not only did I do it with one of my best friends, I got to experince something that comes once in a life time. Also, I had many different experinces out of the United States. Finally, I was kept from going to serve in the military. I for one was a little excited about that.\r\n\r\nLike I said, for a small town boy like me, sailing around the world is an opprotunity of a life time. There was no way I was going to turn down something like that. On my first trip I turned 18 years old and as you probably know, I would have had to join the military. But, they made an exeption due to the fact that I was already involved with the Seagoing Cowboys. Again, there was know way I would take serving in the military over sailing around the world. Another reason why I think that anyone should tryout the Seagoing Cowboys program is because, I had the opprotunity to see many different cultures or ways of life. Once, I got to go on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece. Finally, I got to see many parts of China.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Seagoing Cowboys program, I have gained knowledge about Europe and China. Now, I hope that you will go and enjoy it too.",
        "After reading the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" I have been asked to tell weather or not i think the author did a good job supporting and evaluating his ideas. As i read through the text i looked for key moments that stood out. This author beleives it is right and just to continue our missions to try and explore our neighboring planet. I feel that he does a very good job backing up his statement because he has an interesting introduction, middle and end. The author also does a very good job explaining his theory through lots of detail and background. Finally, the author doesnt just use his knowledge but he goes out there and finds information from experts. To me, those are three componets that will really prove what you believe in.\r\n\r\nThe article starts out with some basic background information to get you hooked onto the topic. It reads, \"IN our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point from earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.\" those few sentences hook the reader on their claim and make you want the author to prove him self. therefore, the author does exactly that throughout the body of the text. He gives detail, background and outside sources but, we'll get into that later. In the end, he raps up the text with his claim once a again and that final kicker that get any strageling readers that dont quite believe him. It states, \"Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the body the author illustrates textbook detailing and informing.",
        "I beileve the tecnology of \"Driverless\" cars is necessary in todays society, and should be used for its worth. One of the few big ideas i saw in the article was the newer use of sensors in the vehicles we use today. Many of the sensors today are used to warn and stop the driver from any collisions or accidents that may accure, at any moment. I beileve that this technology is needed now more than ever for everyone, and not just unexperienced or handicaped drivers. I am currently still learning how to drive and will get my license very, and i am very cautious of my peers driving too. I would feel more comfortable that the car could stop itself wiith out the drivers noticing, and possibly stoping to stop a collision or save my very own life. I would very much like to see this technology come to fruition, and let the world harness it's abilities to further mankind towards a safer and better future.\r\n\r\nThe laws aginst the use of these \"Driverless\" cars are very reasonable too, and need to adjust for further research towards the safety of the people they aim to protect with these laws. I beileve they dont realize that testing and researching these new methods is a step foward, for safety, and not for just the sake of testing variables on somethings. They don't seem to understand that these technologies are being invented to help save people today. If you searched on the internet for just one second you could find all sorts of stories, about their own cars saving the drivers from creating a terrible mistake and saving their lives. These laws make me question us, as a society, more than ever, and as a society how are we allowed to grow in knowledge and sciences, if we cannot test our ideas? We must further sucome to the new technologies we have available, at this time, but we must not lose ourselves in context. We have to push towards breaking these laws aginst testing and accept the new technology, for the future.\r\n\r\nAs a child i watched cartoons with flying cars and cities in space, and in todays age we have the ability to strive for this dream of the future. One day I hope to be sitting in a cab that s driving itself perfectly fine and not releasing large amounts of toxins into the air that we all breath, to survive. This is yet another thing to admire of these \"driverless\" cars, and that is the ability to use much less amounts of fuel, rather than traditional vehicles.",
        "I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. Another big reason is that we really don't know just how much computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad.\r\n\r\nPerforming this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions. New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code. Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units. We really don't know how much the computer can do, it can detect if you're happy or sad, and make computer-animated faces.\r\n\r\nIn a whole, this is a lot to disagree with, since computers are taking over our world now so I believe this is a great idea.",

And if we never took those last photos what would of happen to this research project.\r\n\r\nAs they told us in the story that this as probably just a huge rock formation with shadow giving it the facial feautures to make it look like a person. Some people stil dont belive NASA that that is what it is, they think alliens created that.

        "There are positive and negative aspects of a driverless car. Some people might love the idea on the other hand other people might not. I believe driverless cars are the future, and there going to come up with some very smart cars in the near future.\r\n\r\nI believe that driverles cars are a genius idea because you can do anything while the car is driving. Well of course not everything you don't want to be sleeping and the car crashes onto something because it doesn't detect it. Many people run late in the morning on there way to work or school or wherever they might go and maybe didn't have time for breakfest or didn't finish getting ready\r\n\r\nI believe that you can do that stuff while the car is in motion. Even though you need a driver there in the car \"Tesla is going to release a car capable of driving on autopilot ninety percent of the time\" which means you'll only be driving that ten percent which isn't alot. Yes I do believe the safety of one another is very important but I think the manufactures wouldn't release a car if they knew it wasn't capable of doing the things that the manufactures promised.",
        "People have been debating if the use of new technology should be used in the classroom; however, people have yet to decide. There are two sides to this arugment the pro side. The people who want the use of new technology and then there are them who think newer technology is not needed to learn. These people are the con side. The author Nick D'Alto made great points on how new facal technology could be helpful in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe first way, new facal technology could help in the classroom is by showing when a student is confused and not sure whats going on. In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states \" A classroom computer can recognoze when a student is becoming confused or cored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" As for example, of this when doing math homework online or english the computor could recoginize when the student is confused and then send the student step-by-step insturction. Also the teacher could request this imfomation on which problem the students are confused on and go over them into more detailed.\r\n\r\nThe second reason, as to why we should use facial technology is for students who are intrested into coding and computer-animations. Students can learn how to make video games charactaers more expressive. As in paragraph 6, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video suregery\" This could help when student is taking and computer-animation class and is very intrested into becoming an coder. When making these games the more detail and expresstion the animators can put into these games the more infomation they need. This program can help provide that kind of knowleage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, yes this new facial technology is not nessary. People often say teacher can read their students facial expersstions just fine without technology; however, an teacher might just over look it or not be able to tell what the student is feeling.",

        "A new computer software designed by Thomas Huang can detect emotions just by scanning the face. Everyday, many people hide their emotions, but with this new software, even the slightest bit of discomfort or anguish can be recognized. In classrooms, this innovation will be useful for many reasons.\r\n\r\nFor many years, students have been confused in the classroom or too afraid to ask questions about a particular subject. However, this new software can detect when a student is confused,thus making the lesson easier for the student to understand. The text states that the classroom computer can also recognize when a student is becoming bored, also modifying the lesson to become more entertaining.\r\n\r\nAlthough this new software is groundbreaking, it may have some negative effects. For instance, teachers and professors may lose their jobs as students will no longer feel the need to ask questions. Schools may start to replace teachers with more computers with this software, therefore causing a lesser demand for teachers. Although this may not happen for a while, this concept should still be worrisome and also brought forward.\r\n\r\nThis new innovation, however, should be used more and more everyday for the results are truly remarkeable. Students will no longer be confused or bored in class, and certain ads can be changed to a preference. Video games and other media can also be more enjoyable.",

Some of you would like to pay attention to the streets or what not. It does not matter if you dont like space or planets but if you thinking about it, then now is the time to learn about the planet Venus. In the excerpt, the author explains that Venus is sometimes called the \u00a8Evening Star.\u00a8 This something that you will be shocked about because I wouldve never known. He also explains that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He explains the idea very well because want to welcome many people to study the world to see whats its like to know when something is gonna happen or how its gonna happen.\r\n\r\nSometimes studying things can be real helpful because you can learn so many things about it. The article states, \u00a8These differences in the speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times we are closer to\r\n\r\nVenus.\u00a8 This indicate that anything could happen if we touch one of those planets. He addresses the speed in the planets when it orbits the sun. Anything can go wrong if its always going like that. Its like having something spinning around everyday. Eventually, something is gonna go wrong and its gonna mess everything up. On the other hand, People who study space would know the answer to what will happen if they was to touch.

Would you feel like your privacy was invaded? Would you feel judged? I know I personally would feel threatened and exposed. I beleive that the\r\n\r\nFacial Action Coding System, a computer program that can identify human emotions, would have no value in a classrom because, it has no practical use in a learning enviorment such as a classroom, it would be an invasion of students privacy, and while it may not be of use in a calssroom, it could be put to use in other fields of work.\r\n\r\nI think that this emotion identifing technology would have no practical use in a learning classroom enviorment becasuse teachers have to ensure the material is digested by students no matter what emotinal state they are in. While recogonizing a students emotions could expalin why they may be uninterested in the material it does not change the fact that they still must learn it if they want to further their own education. Therfore, I beleive that this technology would be of no use to both the student and the teacher.\r\n\r\nI also beleive that this technology would have no practical use or value in a classroom due to its nature, its a blatant invasion of privacy.

        "Driverless cars are somethign that has become athign in the last couple of years. This brought great contorversy on whether it is neccessary or if it is plain idiotic. Some people belive that there is no point in a driverless car because it's not technically driverless at this point, it still needs a driver to drive for certain things. I however believe driverless cars is a great idea here is why.\r\n\r\nA driverless car cuts back on gas nearly by half and this is great al around. Gas fumes cause pollution especially with nearly everyone beign a motorist in this day and age; more cars are on the street whihc adds up to more fumes. The gas fumes cut throught the ozone which is very important to the biosphere. Without the ozone layer the air quality will plummit. So if there is a small chance that a driverless car can cut back n gas that;s a great idea. Not only will this cut back on pollution it will cut back on gas prices. Gas prices have steadily increasing over the years and this had put a dent in your pocket. Many people work hard for their money, and a fraction of that goes to your car for gas. So driverless cars are beginning to sound a lot better in these aspects, but how about the overall effect of them.\r\n\r\nIs a driverless car actually driving or assisting you? I believe it is assisting you, which isn't entirely bad. Especillay if you are a new driver it takes some of the pressure off of you as you try adn advance your driving skills. Driverless cars can,\" Steer, accelerate,and brake themselves, but notify thre driver when the road ahead requires human skills.\" If the driver's attention is needed, GM has developed seat that vibrate when the vehicle is\r\n\r\nin danger of backing into an object. Google has a car that announces when the driver is needed.\r\n\r\nThe people and comapnies that develop these cars are keeping safety in mind which leads to a happier consimer.",

It read Mona Lisa smile symply from a computer software and tells what percentage of their emotion she is in. According to the article this can give you any details of a person in paragraph 6 \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confured or bored.\" I actually think that is smart because any you cant see when a person is sad but they have a smile in their face. It tells you how they are feeling that exact time.\r\n\r\nFor instance humans perform the same emotion everyday either if you are happy or sad. In the article it says that they are \"44 muscles just like human muscles\" that can tell your emotion and the percentage of ur emotion. Sometimes they compared it to a real a nuetral face to see the difference.",

Dr. Huang predicts. \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"\r\n\r\nYou can't\r\n\r\nprobably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

        "Driverless cars seem like they would take over the future in about the next twenty years. When in reality technology is not pregressing as quickly as you think.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars would cause chaos in the world. Causing problems the car salesman would not even mention to you. Heres why they would be bad for society.\r\n\r\nWhen people think of this idea of driverless cars they think finally the future has come upon us for once and for all. As stated in the article driverless cars could malfunction and legally the manufacturer would be to blame.All drivers would have to take caution and be aware of there surroundings everywhere they went. Drivers everywhere would have to be alert and furthermore, know that everytime they get into there driverless vehichle that there are risks. The accidents are just one factor there are many others.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars are said to have a feature where the human or driver is alerted to know when to take over. This feature on the car could not be as safe as we are blinded to believe. What if the car does not alert the person fast enough.In that case that would cause lots of problems for everyone who has a driverless cars. I learned from the article that the car does not know how to avoid traffic stops or work zones. That would mean the driver would have to step up and take over for the time being. The article states that they are still working on the type of signaling that it would want to include. I'm sure they would try to find the safest one possible. On a 55 mph freeway would the driver be alerted fast enough to take over ? This question troubles me because what if the vehicle does not stop and the person ignores the signaling.",
        "For many people, including myself, we have days when we are happy, optomistic, and just in a good mood for whatever reason. Then we have days where are sad, pesemistic and overall just in a bad mood.\r\n\r\nOn paragraph eight of this paasage it states that faces don't lie. while I do think that is true I do not think we are at a point where this technology can be accurate enough for us to be able to determine our emotions. Although I do not think it is accurate right now I do believe that in the future technology will able to accurately read our faces and find our emotions and this article shows why and how it is possible.\r\n\r\nThe first way that this passage shows us how emotion reading is possible is by bringing us an example in paragraph one of the Mona Lisa. The paragraph says that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This example right here is meant to show us how the technology can work but brings us more questions that we hopfully get answers for. In paragraph three lots of backround information is given to us so that we can get an idea on how they were able to determine what the emotions of the girl in painting are. the author talks about the main emotions humans show and how technology can now allow us to mimick the muscles that humans have in their face and the movments they can make. In paragraph four the author elaborates a bit more on the technology and how it can be used to search for those mixed emotions. The author cites quotes from Dr. Huang, one of the main people behind the project, in order to give insight to the readers who may not fully belive that reading emotions through technology is possible.",
        "There is a new technology called Facial Action Coding System. This Coding System can identify your emotions. Dr. Paul Eckamn has been classifiying six emotions.\" Eckamn has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.\" \"-Then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\"\r\n\r\nThey have started useing this technology in schools now. \"A classroom computer could recognize when a studen is becoming confused or bored.\" \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" After reading this information from the article, I think we should have this type of technology in school. It could really help the kids who do not talk to their teacher at all. But there is also a downfall of useing this type of technology.\r\n\r\nSome of the bad things that could happen is the computer misreading the kid wrong. Therefore, giving him wrong information about what ever he is learning about. It is also very expensive. The worst thing that could happen is the teachers who went to school their whole life trying to become a teacher, they are now jobless. What is the point of paying somebody to teach a student when there is now a computer in their school to do it. That is one of the major negative things from this technology.\r\n\r\nSome of the good things that could happen is the student actually learning. There are many students who just sit in the back of the class not talking, but when a computer can do it for them they will probably learn a lot more. They don't have to say one word because when the computer feels that you are sad/happy it would change the subject.\"For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.",
        "There are many people that love driving for the fun of it or for family bonding or even friendly bonding. There are companies that want to start making driverless cars so that we don't have to drive and I don't think that should happen because obesity and laziness is a huge problem in america already, these cars I believe are unsafe, and I don't think the laws will even allow this. Driverless cars should'nt be made and in these paragraphs I will tell you why.\r\n\r\nThe first reason I have is that obesity and laziness is already a huge problem in America. I have read many articles and heard many stories on the news about America being obese. If these cars are made this will only add to the problem and I say that because if people don't have to drive anymore then most will go home and sit on the couch to watch some tv. And when doing that they usually have a bite to eat while doing it. When driving you have to walk out to the car, move your foot when your driving, move your hands to steer, and also get out the car and walk to where your going. These are all ways of getting some type of excercise. The world needs it's excercise.\r\n\r\nThe second reason I have is that it appears to be unsafe. In the article it states that, \" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--- the driver or the manufaturer?\". This is why I think it is unsafe if the car as some type of disfunction or mishap while on the road with other human controlled cars it could hurt someone really bad or maybe even kill a person.",

The author describes the similarities of Venus and Earth, provides solutions to living on Venus, and expresses how researching Venus would be an advancement of the human mind.\r\n\r\nThe author supports their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit despite its dangers, by suggesting that Venus may have once been similar to Earth. The author wrote in paragraph 4, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" By suggesting that Venus could have some answers to Earth's climate, the author provides strong support to their claim. The text also states in paragraph 4, \"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" The author goes on to describe how Earth and Venus may have been closely related long ago. It is also mentioned that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit, which is beneficial considering the how long space travel takes. The author's claim is supported through this evidence of Venus being Earth-like at one point in time.\r\n\r\nAnother way that the author suppprts their claim is by providing some solutions to studying Venus, despite the dangers it possesses. The author writes in paragraph 5, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.\" In paragraph 5, the author continues to explain how the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not go over the radiation levels on Earth. The solution that the author suggests helps support their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit by giving direct evidence as to how researchers may go about doing this.",

It tell you about tells you about all the grater thing that they can do and even the not so greater outcomes that can come from a driverless car.\r\n\r\nMy position with driverless cars is that I think they will be a great idea because it gives humans a better chance at looking out for thing that might potically can get them into a car accident. \" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on idividual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better repsonse and control than a human driver could manage alone.\" The driverless cars can protect you than you can protect yourself and anyone else in the car with you. The driverless car can even handle any driving functions up to the speeds of 25mph. The cars are designed to let the driver know when there is accident ahead of when there is road constrution going on so it tells the humans to take control because the car knows that it can't do it by itself. \" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves,but all are esigned to notify the driver when the road ahead requries human skills,... navigating through work zones and aroung accidents.\" The car can a geart thing that happens to the world.\r\n\r\nThe driveless car has been around for as couple of years.

It is a good idea because in the article it says that the drivers will get an alert to when they have to take control over the wheel. In paragraph 5 it states \"Special touch sensors make sure the drivers keep hold of the wheel.\" The car isnt dangerous or anything. The car will be safe and smart. In paragraph 2 it says that \"Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.\" maybe we could reduce the amount of car crashes per year.\r\n\r\nYes , there is some negative results but what are the chances? People want a safer car and about half of the world will accept the Driverless Cars. It has more positives results than negative. \"Sensing the World\"? the cars have sensors that detect a problem around the car. In this article it said that sensors arent new. Sensors should be a problem to the people since they have been out. Also in the article it says \" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\"",
        "In 1976, a Mars Global Surveyor snapped pictures of what is known as the \"Face on Mars.\" It is a natural landformation and is visible becuase of the pictures shown, the internet, and the area the landform is located.\r\n\r\nFirst, the pictures show the \"face.\" In 1976, the pixels were 43m (meters) per pixel. In 2001, the pixels were only 1.56m per pixel. The quality is worse the bigger the pixels.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, the quality of the pixels were clear enough to show that the \"face\" was only a lanform. In the picture of 1976, it is visible that the picture is blurry. In the picture of 1998, the picture is less blurry, but still hard to see. In the 2001 picturer, the picture is very visible and well seen. At the bottom of the mesa, it is also visible to see the lanform has a rounded, smooth, almost non man-made surface that buried the landform into the planet side.\r\n\r\nNext, the Internet, showed what the scientists and the picters showed. A landform.\r\n\r\nIn the text, it states that when the picture was taken in 1998, it was the cloudy time of theyear on the red planet.\r\n\r\nFinally, where the \"face\" is located. The face is located in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.\r\n\r\nIn the article, it states that \"The sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah.\" Although the NASA researchers have concluded the \"face\" to be a natural landform, many are not satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nMany people claim that it was built by aliens, however, pictures do not lie.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the \"Face on Mars\" is really a mystery.",

Venus is the closest planet to Earth and people can not land on its surface for long because it is very different, as in the way it orbits the sun or how the clouds are corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" suggest that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is so close to earth and share similar traits with each other, the author wants this challenge to be conquered, and for the experience to be a learning insight.\r\n\r\nFirst, the author states that Venus is referred to as Earth's \"twin\" because of their close proximity, density and size. This is a way that the author supports the idea because it should be a way that humans can reach this planet and study it. Also, because Venus is thought to be the most Earth like planet in the solar system. Ideas should be created in order to reach the limits of Venus.\r\n\r\nThen, the author supports the idea with the statistic of how spaceships has not been able to touch Venus in more than three decades. As said in the article, \"the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?\"(paragraph 4) If the challenge can be conquered of landing on Venus safely, Astronomers can gather so much insight that could also lead to other big things being conquered.\r\n\r\nLastly, the author supports the idea with the knowledge that can be gained from the experience. There has already been an idea of how humans will get to Venus, \" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.",

Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, would agree. \"He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world.\" With such new and brilliant technology, drivers will be able to sit back and watch as the car drives them. Some new cars have cameras and multiple different types of sensors. This gives drivers a full car body view of what is going on around the car. This technology will bring a new sense of safeness to passengers.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Google had already started inventing and testing a car that was able to drive independently \"under specific conditions.\" It has been said that this and other models of the car were able to drive over half a million miles without getting into a car accident. However, these cars are not yet completely driver-free. Certain situations such as pulling in and out of a driveway, and dealing with complicated road traffic require human assistance. The Toyota Prius was modified by Google, and on the car, sensors and cameras were implanted. The \"dubbed LIDAR\" \"uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.\" This allows drivers to get a 360 view of what is around them, and the feel of being more safe will be implemented.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" produced by BMW, was able to withstand speeds of 25 mph and below, but required human touch on the steereing wheel.",

Having a computer read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom can be both effective, and ineffective for several different reasons. Some of these reasons may include: emotional state, lesson planning, facial structure, critical thinking, puberty, and more.\r\n\r\nThe emotional state of most kids in school can vary on a day to day basis. Not every kid is always happy, and not every kid is always sad. By having a computer that can read and detect emotions, people might not feel the need to try and read each other's emotion. This would lessen their contact with their peers and lessen their ability to comprehending and understand other people's emotions and situations. Teachers might also worry if they detect that a student is sad, or angry.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, having a machine that can detect emotions may be helpful to some students. As stated in the article, If most, or all, of the class is confused, this machine would help the teacher detect the confusion and help him or her explain in a way that the student's can understand. \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" In this quote, we see how this computer could help adapt a better lesson plan for confused or uninterested students. If a student is depressed, anxious, or something of the like; the teacher can pull them off to the side and send them to a counselor to talk about it and help them feel better. However, we may wonder if the student is actually feeling this way.\r\n\r\nIf a technology like this is used, it will obviously have loads of coding in it. Sometimes there can be flaws in coding, or someone that can hack into it and change it. To have such a sensitive thing in a classroom may be dangerous for some students. Another point is that not everyone has the same facial structure. Some people even have deformities or problems that make their appearance different than other people's.",
        "There is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. It can be used to capture images of a person's face and decide if that person is happy, sad, etc. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the autor talks about how \"A classroom computer could reconginze when a student is becomeing confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This could be valuable in some cases, but in most, it won't be of any help.\r\n\r\nThe main reason that this new technoogy won't work is that there are multiple people in a class. Different students can have different emotions about a certain topic in school. For example, if a teacher is teaching math, 5 kids might think that what they are learing is really cool and interesting but, 10 other kids might think that math is dull and irritating.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may be times where there is only one kid in a classroom, like explained in paragraph 6. In this case you can change the lesson. When there is 30 to 50 kids in a class, how can you change a whole lesson just because a fraction of the students thinks it's boring? It would be really unfair to the majority of the kids who currently like the lesson plan. You also can't teach some kids one lesson, then the other kids a different lesson. It won't be the same and this can put a lot of stress on the teachers that have to teach and grade the lessons.\r\n\r\nThere is a way that the FACS could work.",
        "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The text states many facts and statistics; therefore, the author supports this idea well, for he/she describes why astronomers are amazed by Venus, what NASA is planning on approaching the planet, and explaining the type of challenge it is to explore this dangerous \"Evening Star.\" Reading the passage, the author is convincing about the subject that he/she has chosen.\r\n\r\nThe planet, Venus, is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, as the author suggests. Supporting this idea, the author shows many examples, facts, and ideas why he/she thinks Venus is a worthy planet to keep studying, for the text states, \"Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.\" The writer describes that important studies come out of exploring Venus's reputation, even though it is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author supports the claim that Venus has many thrilling factors in Paragraph 3. Paragraph 3, Line 6 states, \"Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface.\" The author demonstrates his knowledge telling the readers that Venus cause many disasterous events that happen all around the world.\r\n\r\nAs the author claims that Venus is worth studying for, Paragraphs 4 through 7 shows evidence about scientists still studying Venus as of today and why geologists and atronomers are so fascinated with the blazing planet. In Paragraph 4, Line 2 states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" Scientists state that even today, Venus has features that look like mountains, as read in the passage. Testing his knowledge in the prompt, the author demonstrates that NASA wants to make visiting Venus possible. Throughout Paragraphs 5 through 7, it states what NASA's (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) plan is to successfully observing Venus from a up-close point of view. In Paragraph 5, Line 2 and 3 state, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.\" As being stated as a \"possible solution,\" the author shows NASA's solution is not an effecient plan, for Paragraph 6, Lines 1 through 4 state, \"However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.",
        "This article for me is kind of hard to believe. These people have never been up there to see this face on the red planet. Instead of sending a person up there to actually see it they send a machine to Mars to capture pictures of this face.\r\n\r\nScientist believe that this face is remains of alien structure but, do they have proof that aliens even exist? If they could get a picture of the face then why could they not get a picture of the aliens that were up there to die and have this face on face of Mars. This photo could just be a regular bump on the surface and the way the lighting is might make it look kind of like a face but, they have not yet to send anyone up there so they do not know for sure. If they really think that this is a face then they should send someone up there to capture a legit photo that is close up to prve that this face is really there. The face does not even look like a deformed creature it looks like a humans face and that is another thing that makes me not believe it. The scientist said that this face is a remain of an alien artifact but, if this is an alien than people might as well just start calling themselves aliens and aliens humans. If you look on the right side of the face you can not see anything but the shadow.",
        "The Facial Action Coding Sytem is not valuable in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the the introduction say, \"New sofware has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others.\" I say this because techology can make mistskes such as a computer that can read your emotions through your face and can have an accurate result. For example you might think an person who is happy by showing a smile but is the person really happy behind that smile with hidden emotions. It's not only one person there are others too who hide their emotions.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 5 says, \"For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actuallly describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convry specific emotions.\" I can somewhat agree because he is right about the fact that it's hard describing a facial expreesion that includes surprised or sad.\r\n\r\nThis shows that we dont need this type technology to show other people how we feel if they accurate.",
        "Do you think that the \"Face on Mars\" is not a real face but just a natural landform? Well, we think it is just a naural landform because when the first image appeared on JPL web site, it rereal that it's just a natural landform. Also, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground you would be able to see what they were. In addition, what the picture actually shows is a landform common around the American West.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surefers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing that it's just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nNext, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" Garvin added. \"So, If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people might say that the Mars Orbiter Camera team didn't take the photo cleary than the original Viking photos or they could think that the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars but, on April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" said Garvin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\r\n\r\nLast, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a landforms common aroung the American West.",
        "The computer used to reccognisze peoples emotions uses muscle but the computer is not smart enough to recognize their emotions within their heart and hypocracy,which is the opposite of an emotion,the computer also forgets that there\r\n\r\na talented paople and there are some some people that have mental problems,\r\n\r\nand lastly people that get fraustrated when suprised.Sometimes when a comedian makes up a joke,he expects the audience to laugh,but in most cases 30% of the\r\n\r\naudience find it funny out of the 100%,but if the remaiming 70% finds out that other people are laughing,they just have to follow the crowd and reduce tension\r\n\r\nto the comedian.\r\n\r\nFrom the passage,in paragraph 4,the author says that it's \"unversal\",but again forgets that there are unique people,just like the left handed people and people\r\n\r\nwith high IQ.This doesn't make the computer to recognize everyones emotion,\r\n\r\nunless being forced to make an emotion,but by this,it makes the unique feel left\r\n\r\nout which is a contributing factor to commiting suicide.And in paragraph 8,if faces of paople doesn't lie,what about people with down syndrome and thieves that escapes trials for murder,because there are some murderers that calls the emergency themselves as an acs of deceiving.And as for student,they happily\r\n\r\ncheat in the examination,but when the teacher asks\"how was it\",the student will reply in a sad tone saying that \"it was too hard\".",
        "This is not created by aliens, it was created by landforms and only landforms because aliens are not smart. What would they do with a face, just make a rock out of it? Scientists agree that is was created by natural landforms.\r\n\r\nThe only way it could have been created is by natural landform that happen way longer than when they dicovered the face. In paragraph 7 it says \"Revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien minument after all\". That states that there was no aliens involved with the face. What would aliens use to make the face in the rocks?\r\n\r\nScientists say that in paragraph 12 \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West\". So this means that it doesn't really have any evidence that aliens made it. This just means that it very well could be just natural landform creating things.\r\n\r\nBut, some people may think like the people in paragraph 8. \" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze\".",
        "I think that we should have this Facial Action Coding System. It can make teaching much easier for a teacher and learning much easier on students. The FACS can change just about everything we know about human emotions. This could be a new way to help people in classrooms and people with depression.\r\n\r\nSince this FACS was made we are able to better understand how people are feeling. Wethier its in the classroom helping the teacher better engage his or her students into there lesson, or its helping someone who dosent want to show emoting get help with something thats bothering them.Since the face can show so much more emotion than we can normally see we are able to see deeper down at what they are actually feeling. As in paragraph 6 it quotes \"A Classroom coumputer could recognzer when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrutor.\" Knowing that many people dont want to be in a classroom there whole day this system will be able to change there action of study to where its more enjoyable for the student to sit there and actually learn about the material.",
        "On May 24, 2001 25 years ago something wierd happend on Mars. Viking 1 spacecraft was going around Mars, taking pictures of landing places for its sister ship. While taking pictures the Vicking saw the shadowy likeness of a human face. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time ever. Michael Malin and and his Mars Orbiter Camera, took picturse 10 times shaper then then from the preveous Viking picture. After that they conclued that there was no alien monument after all.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor came realy close for a second look. Garvin said this \" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to the center the Face in look.\" Malins team got an really extraordinary picture of the face, by using camera's absolute maximum resoltion.\r\n\r\nIn the 2001 Viking photo its spans 1.56 meters, in 1976 Viking photo comaperd to 43 meters per pixel.\r\n\r\nAfter all of the studies and looking at the picturese, what the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa. They are landforms common in West American. Its a lava dome that takes a form of a isolated mesa its about the same size and height as the face of Mars. So thats why the pictue is just a natural landform. And not alien artifact.",
        "I am against this Facial Action Coding System because how diffcult it will be for these teacher to put this modification in every school and computer. How long would it take for this project to happen, will it work, going through all this can be a problem, why would we need all this if we can ask one simple question to all the students \"Are you ok?\" Even if the school wants this we will need to take each of the students picture and modify it into a \"3-D computer model program\" as said in paragraph 3 we have 44 major face muscles which they will need to go into to that program and modify it. Every kid has mixed emotions one day they can be happy one day they can be sad, angry, and or stressfull. This Program can not improve or prove how us students are feeling, We would be happy and the computer program pops up with anti-depression pills, Computers are like us humans we mess up sometimes and we arent always right.\r\n\r\nLike what i said we can ask the students directly without any expensive computer programs, with one little questions \"are you ok?\" \"Are you doing fine?\" \"For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/her face. we won't be needing these 3-D facial modifications, sometimes people can be smilling but deep inside they could be mad,sad, angry,glad. I don't think it matters about the face it matter about the heart, nobody can tell how you're feeling with just a face. If you're watching a sad movie and you're crying your happy but sad at the same time how can a computer program no that you're really not sad but happy.",

Scientist should study Venus because they could find more similiaraties between Earth and Venus, there could have been life in Venus long ago, and We could one day live in Venus.\r\n\r\nIf scientists studied Venus they could find many more similarities.

These two quotes shows us we have to study Venus more to see what other similarities it has to Earth.\r\n\r\nScientist should study Venus to see if there has been life at Venus long ago. On paragraph 4 the author states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,\" this means that it once was the most Earth-like planet. On paragraph 4 it also states that, \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth,\" this is telling us that long ago it was probably covered in water and it supported various forms of life. if there is water on the planet, there was probably life long ago.",

It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows\u0097even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" Lots of people believe it is an alien, but it is not.

In fact, the Face is just a natural landform.\r\n\r\nThe Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could make images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

        "I belive that driverless cars are a good idea. Personaly, I don't trust people on the roads. People get distracted easily, can have slow reaction times, and sometimes just are not safe. Driverless cars can fix all these problems easily.\r\n\r\nOne issue is that people easily get distracted. Smart cars, on the otherhand, are complety built for the purpose of diving and analizing the roads. The feature most appealing to me and that fixes this issue is found here in the passage, \" Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.\".\r\n\r\nThe second issue with drivers in cars are the drivers reaction times being to slow. Some people just do not have the reactions to be able to use the breaks fast enough to avoid accidents. These cars do it instantly, as stated in the passage, \" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels and reduce power from ethe engine, allowing far bettter response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\".\r\n\r\nFinaly, sometimes people just are not safe. Doing anything from texting while driving or taking erratic turns without signal can be extreamly dangerous to themselfs or anyone around them.",

I think you need to try seagoing Cowboy program beacause in the passage \"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.\" There was a man named Luke Bomberger he loved this program he even experienced going over the Alantic Ocean six-teen times and also went though the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by the World War ll.

That needed to be recoverdfrom desasters.\r\n\r\nI also think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program because it states that in paragraph six that you care about animals on the way back from safty. Would you like to save a pour animals life? It states that \"Bales of hay and bages of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.\" It also states that they have to clean the stalls. that would mean that the pour animals need your help because they need more people to help them out with the pour animals with feeding them and also cleanding there stalls.",

By having driverless cars it takes away that.\r\n\r\nWhere is the fun in driving if its doing it for you? As a teenager you look forward to first getting a car and driving around with your friends. Its a time where you can bond and be social. By having driverless cars its the fun out it , think about what is fun about sitting behind a wheel while it drives itself?\r\n\r\nDriverless cars create alot of danger also. Even today when drivers are more alert ever , there are millions of people who die in car crashes every year. Imagine the number of people who will die because people are not aware while the car is driving its self. Its in human nature for people to get a certain comfort level while doing something. Thousands of people on the road driving unalert and comfortable is not a safe thing.\r\n\r\nBy having driverless car it takes out alot business also. There's million of kids who learn how to drive thru drivers ed.",
        "In 1976 NASA captured a picture of Mars with the Viking 1. This photo was taken of a Martian mesa which resembled a human face. When this was shown to the public, people went crazy. People said that it was created by aliens, but others say it was\r\n\r\njust a landform on Mars.\r\n\r\nFor my evidence that this photo is in fact a normal natural landfrom on Mars. We shall compare the dates these photos were taken. When Viking 1 first took the picture of the \"Face\" we weren't able to see all of the details. Remember at the time photography wasn't as superb as it was in 2001. In 1998 when MGS took the picture of the \"Face\" we were able to get a clearer product, but there were clouds in the way. If those clouds were not in the way we would have evidence it was a landform sooner. At the perfect time NASA was able to get a clear photo with better technology we were able to see the \"Face\" for what is really was.\r\n\r\nAt the time conspiracy theorist said that NASA was hiding the truth from the public saying that life on Mars did exist, but they were relunctant to show it. Even if they did find life on Mars it would be a huge scientific discovery. Why would we be forced to hide the truth from the people and not answer the biggest question in\r\n\r\nhistory. Are We Alone. Just to add on, these conspiracy theorist did not have enough evidence to prove their claim either.\r\n\r\nNow this ties in with my first claim of technology at the time. if you compare the photo from 1976 and 2001 you can see a major difference. Shading. In the Voyager 1's photo the lighting is not the best. Shadows in the photo make the illusion that there is a face in this rock.",
        "I am against the driverless cars because it would take alot of money to make these cars and they could also be dangerous and cause crashes. If the car needs you to take over and the person isnt paying attencion then it could cause an accident. Another way it could be dangerous is if the car wasnt made right and the technology fails. And maybe people would save money on gas but they would lose alot of money making them because of all the things the car needs like sensors. And if the car did fail whos fault would it be the driver or the manufacturers.",

        "Driving has been a necessary skill in society ever since Ford made the T Model. Since then the use of cars has only become more common within society. People use cars to go to and from work, as well as to travel on vacation and chauffer people around. While driving, people could be doing much more productive things, such as preparing for the arrival of a destination, or doing homework or fun activities. The legitamacy of the development of the driverless car is confirmed by the by the actions that people go through each day and the convenience that the car would provide, once laws are passed to make the car a reality.\r\n\r\nThese days people's lives are filled with stressful tasks such as work, school, and extracurricular activities. A lot of peoples' time is used to drive when the time could be directed towards more productive things. The development of sensor technology (paragraph 5) has allowed for the possibility of a car that can almost drive itself. As companies such as Tesla, Audi, Mercedez Benz, and Nissan come closer to the objective of a car that can completely drive itself (paragraph 10), people are still presented with difficult tasks to fulfill other than driving. That is why the development of technology that can drive itself and take the work load off of the driver and free up time for the driver would be beneficial to society.\r\n\r\nThe arguement that the people might have against the car could be laws that prohibit unattended vehicles on the road, and the conflict between driver or manufacturer if there is an accident. It is clearly stated in the passage (paragraph 9) that manufactureres belive that more states will allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars on roads as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. Many automakers are predicting that the problems ahead will be solved (paragraph 10). Also, the debate between the drivers fault, or the manufacturers fault (paragraph 9) can easily be settled with a few waivers, laws, and signed papers.\r\n\r\nThe convenience and safety of the driverless car is becoming more and more legitimate as manufactureres continue to produce and develop capable cars.",

As stated by the article, \" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" Driverless cars today aren't all that beneficial and requiredue the attention of drivers, how can we be positive that the new cars said to come will be ready to prevent accidents without the requirence of human attention? Not only do these cars seem to be safeless, but due to all that worl that is said to come and all the new technology, dont they seem expensive and out of reach?\r\n\r\nThe driverless cars are said to come, but with the technology that will be invested into this project, it seems to be out of reach from those who are interested.

If this technology can read facial expressions then it could be a good thing but this is why it would not help.\r\n\r\nWhen you are in school do you ever feel bored? We all do sometimes that is just how things work. Now do you think that if our computers could tell if we were bored that it would make the lesson any more exciting. The lessons that we are taugh are mostly given to the teachers or the teachers make it. If our computers think that we are bored of the lesson it wants to change that. How does that happen? The teahcer would have to make more than one lesson to teach the class. There are also things that are just completely boring at school there can not be a way to make them any better.\r\n\r\nThen there is also one or two good things about it like if it were able to detecte if someone were not feeling very good about themselves.

        "Is the Facial Action Coding System Useful in Classrooms?\r\n\r\nWhat if there was a machine capable of not only reconizing, but also understanding feelings via facial expressions? There actually is a machine that could do that. It is called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. This technology could be very useful in classrooms, it could reconize the emotions of the students, it could help identify or even prevent certain situations before they even happen by identifying a problem, and it could help give teachers much needed feedback on the class that they wouldn't verbally recieve.\r\n\r\nFACS constructs a 3-D model of the face. It takes into account all 44 maajor facial muscles to determine the feelings or emotions of a person. For example, if you raise your forntalis pars lateralis, or the mucles above your eyes, you are displaying surprise. Using this technology in classrooms could help learn the emotions of students and show how they are feeling.\r\n\r\nIdentifying emotions in the classroom could be very useful. Students on average sit in classrooms for 6-8 hours a day. Their emotions are still developing and they themselves are still maturing. Sometimes, students may have breakdown or outburst because of various reasons. A student might be stressed out about their grades and begin to preform poorly. Usinng FACS this behavior could be predicted and prevented, letting the teacher know that that student needs a little extra encouragement or more academic assitment. Also, the school enviroment has many variables aside from classrooms alone and that could also cause problems. A student who becomes angry at their classmates has the possibilty of putting them in trouble, It coould either lead to a fight, confrontation, bullying, an other things. Yet, if the problem could be determined becore it could even start, it could help defuse or prevent the situation from escalating resulting in a safer learning enviroment.",
        "My approach on drivless cars is, everything works perfectly, the car coudln't get better than that. It has sensors to notify you that there is an accident ahead, or a road blocik ahead. I got the following details from the passage. I would honestly buy one, it seems much, safer than the average car. When you drive the average car now people tend to get drunk and reckless drive. But the Driverless car prevents that because there are alot sensors.\r\n\r\nI would rather drive the Driverless Car because it is much safer for younger drivers. The whole entire car is like a human steering the wheel, I read this part in the passage. \" The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.\" So the car is like a professional driver. Drunk drivers would be safer driving the driverless car, instead of a 2012 Impala. The driverless car is a much safer car for the community.\r\n\r\nI have came to my conclusion that the driverless car is safer than an average car. The driverless car can steer itself, the driverless car has driven more than half a million miles without crashing, and the driverless car mimics the skill of a human at the wheel."

        "The emergence of autonomous vehicles heralds a seismic shift in the realm of transportation, offering a glimpse into a future where vehicles navigate themselves. However, this groundbreaking advancement is not devoid of pitfalls. While advocates champion the heightened safety and convenience that driverless cars promise, the specter of unforeseen repercussions necessitates vigilance and prudence. In my view, the progress of autonomous driving should be met with tempered enthusiasm, underscoring the importance of rigorous testing and comprehensive regulatory frameworks prior to its wide-scale integration.\n\nIn an enlightening piece titled \"The Oncoming Wave of Autonomous Vehicles,\" there is poignant emphasis on the notable safety enhancements attributed to self-driving cars. By eradicating human fallibility\u2014a primary catalyst for numerous vehicular mishaps\u2014these automated vehicles have unparalleled potential to significantly curtail traffic-related fatalities. The article presents compelling data showcasing a decline in accidents observed during trials featuring driverless cars, lending credence to arguments advocating for an upswing in road safety standards. Moreover, it underscores the undeniable ease that automated transport offers, especially for individuals from aging or disabled demographics.\n\nNevertheless, pertinent concerns highlighted within the article shed light on issues such as job displacement within the transportation sector and susceptibilities inherent in these systems towards hacking incidents and technical glitches.",
        "I believe we should employ technology to decode the Face on Mars, as our current observations might not fully capture its true essence. That's precisely why we have advanced technology today, allowing us to attempt a clearer understanding of this enigmatic structure or at least try to discern what it truly represents. Everything aligns perfectly because researchers now possess sophisticated equipment capable of capturing higher resolution images and interpreting the geological features with precision. The initial images may have given rise to misconceptions due to lighting effects, yet ongoing analysis proves that what seemed like a face is merely an illusion created by shadows.\n\nDespite widespread belief in its mysterious appearance, scientists perform detailed calculations and analyses regularly. I think using scientific methods is undoubtedly the best approach because how else can we explore such phenomena besides relying on evidence-based research? Our brains are inclined toward pareidolia\u2014seeing familiar patterns where none exist\u2014but advanced imaging helps dispel these illusions by revealing natural landforms shaped by geological activity over millions of years.\n\nUltimately, while it's tempting to indulge in fantasies about extraterrestrial artistry, scientific consensus strongly supports that the Face on Mars is a natural formation. Its origins lie in geological processes and optical illusions rather than alien craftsmanship. Therefore, when faced with uncertainties like this one, employing technological advancements remains our most reliable tool for uncovering truth from speculation.",
        "In this piece of writing, the author tells us that looking into Venus is a good idea because it's kind of like Earth.  Venus is about the same size and isn't too far away, distance-wise.  No spacecraft has ever had people on it because they don't last long once they get to the planet. The planet's stmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, like 97%, and corrosive sulfuric acid.  It's super hot, over 800 degrees Fahrenheit on average, and the air pressure is almost 90 times more than ours.\n\nA long time ago, Venus probably had oceans and maybe even life like Earth. It has similar stuff on the surface like valleys, mountains, and craters. Because it's close by, it might be the easiest planet to visit. NASA especially wants to send people there to study it. They think if they make the spacecraft float about 30 miles above the surface, they can avoid most of the problems. It would still be hot, around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to what we have here at sea level.",
        "Here's my rewrite of the text about the Face on Mars, adopting the style and tone of the reference text:\n\nThe \"Face on Mars,\" as captured by Viking 1's orbiter in 1976, presents a fascinating subject that deserves thorough examination despite skepticism it has received. As the author suggests through careful analysis of scientific data, this geological formation is worthy of study, for it teaches us about natural Martian processes, what NASA has discovered through various missions, and explaining why some still believe in artificial origins despite evidence to the contrary. Reading the scientific findings, the data is convincing about the natural formation of this feature.\n\nThe Face on Mars is a remarkable example of natural geological processes, as the evidence clearly shows. Supporting this conclusion, scientists present many examples, facts, and observations that demonstrate why they believe the Face is naturally formed, for the data states that high-resolution imaging reveals an asymmetrical formation consistent with wind erosion. The writer describes that important scientific understanding comes from studying such formations, even though some still cling to more fantastic explanations... \"Our pursuit of knowledge about Mars and other celestial bodies should not be limited by preconceived notions but should be expanded through careful scientific observation and analysis.\" The evidence claims that exploring all possible explanations is important, but we must follow where the data leads us.",

        "Here's an enriched version of the text with more sophisticated language and varied structures while maintaining the core message:\n\nThe dawn of autonomous vehicle technology heralds an unprecedented metamorphosis in the annals of transportation. Though skeptics voice trepidation regarding safety protocols and workforce displacement, the evolution of self-navigating automobiles harbors transformative potential that eclipses these concerns. The seamless incorporation of autonomous vehicles into our existing infrastructure promises to revolutionize road safety paradigms, democratize mobility access, and orchestrate a more streamlined transportation ecosystem.\n\nThe cornerstone of the autonomous vehicle proposition rests in its capacity to curtail traffic-related casualties dramatically. Research illuminates a sobering statistic: human fallibility underlies more than 90% of vehicular incidents, with driver exhaustion, wandering attention, and chemical impairment emerging as principal culprits. In contrast, autonomous vehicles\u2014outfitted with state-of-the-art sensory arrays and sophisticated algorithmic frameworks\u2014exhibit superhuman information processing capabilities while maintaining vigilance that never wavers. Moreover, these technological marvels stand poised to emancipate countless individuals\u2014particularly the elderly and differently-abled\u2014from the constraints of traditional transportation dependencies. The transformative impact of this innovation promises to restore autonomy to millions of Americans previously marginalized by conventional mobility paradigms, fundamentally reshaping their daily lived experiences and diminishing their reliance on external support networks.\n\nWhile detractors underscore potential job displacement within the transportation sector and raise valid cybersecurity apprehensions, these challenges warrant reframing as catalysts for innovation rather than insurmountable barriers. The burgeoning autonomous vehicle industry has already spawned myriad employment opportunities across diverse domains\u2014from software architecture to systems maintenance and operational oversight. Simultaneously, manufacturers are pioneering sophisticated security protocols to fortify these systems against digital threats.",
        "Here's my rewrite of the FACS text, matching the more informal, personal style of the reference text:\n\nI think the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a really interesting idea, but there's definitely good and bad sides to it. Some people might love using it in classrooms, while others might not. The way FACS works is pretty amazing - it lets computers look at tiny movements in your face to figure out how you're feeling.\n\nI believe FACS in classrooms isn't such a great idea because you can't really trust it to understand what students are actually feeling. Like, what if a student is just thinking really hard about something, but the computer thinks they're confused or upset? That wouldn't be good at all. Even though the technology is super smart, it's not perfect.\n\nI think the biggest problem is that students might feel weird knowing they're being watched all the time.",
        "We are not into creating quote- earning similar line systems and rather we aim to make a difference in the\u2002educational sector by effectively integrating technology to cater to the student community. In \u201cMaking Mona Lisa Smile,\u201d one of the innovations discussed is the Facial Action Coding\u2002System (FACS), which allows computers to detect \u2014 and interpret \u2014 human emotions through facial expressions. Of course, some may decry using this technology to analyze the emotional expressions of students in a classroom as an unwarranted invasion of privacy\u2014but when the potential benefits (minimal risk to the individual, as you are a data point in the system) are analysed in relation to the cost of not knowing, the use of such technology in a classroom in\u2002order to better engage students renders the benefits clear.\n\nEducators would have more relevant data to design teaching approaches that meet students' emotional state when using the FACS\u2002in classrooms. For instance, by accurately measuring student emotions, teachers can tailor the instruction to meet the individual needs,\u2002building a more personalized and effective learning. Consider, for\u2002example, the scenario in which a student shows glimpses of frustration or confusion in a lesson: the teacher can step in while the information is fresh and offer clarification or extra help to ensure that the student does not get behind academically.\n\nIn addition to supporting specific learning objectives, the use of technology (e.g., FACS) can also help develop\u2002social and emotional learning skills for students such as self-awareness and empathy. In the process, by encouraging students to consider their\u2002own emotional reactions and identify those of their peers, teachers can foster key social skills for interpersonal communication and collaboration. Furthermore, using data obtained via the FACS, patterns in emotional expressions can be detected which may also highlight\u2002when a subject faces deteriorating mental health or behavioral issues that would otherwise remain undetected. In such cases, early detection and intervention can make all of the difference in terms of giving students\u2002the support and resources they need to flourish academically and personally.\n\nPara: Despite the occasional objections that may be raised regarding the privacy issues associated with letting the FACS scan the emotional expressions of students in the classroom- the power of amending curriculum through reading the metrics of how students feel, can hold unfathomable\u2002potential.",

        "Here's an enriched version that maintains the core message while elevating the language and structural variety:\n\nThe emergence of autonomous vehicles, as chronicled in \"Driverless Cars are Coming,\" heralds a revolutionary metamorphosis in transportation. While advocates extol their potential to revolutionize road safety, ameliorate traffic flow, and democratize mobility for non-drivers, I maintain that their wholesale integration into our transportation ecosystem warrants measured deliberation, given the profound implications for public safety, workforce dynamics, and technological resilience.\n\nAt the forefront of these considerations lies the paramount issue of public safety. Though the article illuminates how autonomous vehicles might mitigate human error\u2014the predominant factor in traffic incidents\u2014the technology's track record reveals disconcerting vulnerabilities. A particularly sobering case in point: the fatal collision where a self-driving vehicle's sensory array failed to register a pedestrian's presence. Such incidents cast long shadows over the technology's current capabilities and underscore the chasm between aspiration and reality. Beyond safety concerns, the socioeconomic reverberations of this technological shift loom large. The displacement of professional drivers\u2014from taxi operators to long-haul truckers\u2014threatens to unleash a cascade of economic disruption that could exacerbate existing societal fissures and trigger widespread occupational displacement. Moreover, the technological infrastructure underpinning these vehicles presents its own labyrinth of challenges. The article astutely observes that autonomous vehicles depend on an intricate ballet of software and hardware components, which must perform flawlessly across an infinite spectrum of scenarios\u2014a benchmark that remains tantalizingly out of reach. The specter of system vulnerabilities and potential cyber intrusions poses an additional layer of complexity that demands resolution.\n\nWhile the transformative potential of autonomous vehicles remains indisputable, their current limitations mandate a prudent approach to implementation. The confluence of safety concerns, workforce implications, and technological hurdles necessitates thorough resolution before these vehicles can be entrusted with our daily transportation needs. In the interim, the focus must remain on cultivating robust regulatory frameworks and implementing comprehensive safeguards to ensure both public safety and economic stability. The road to autonomous transportation, while promising, requires careful navigation through these complex challenges.",
        "Why the author puts forward that exploring Venus is worthy. The author, I believe, is trying to convey that if Earth ever became uninhabitable, Venus could be a potential habitat. Often called Earth's \"twin,\" Venus stands as the nearest in density and size and sometimes even in distance. However, its scorching surface temperatures exceed 800 degrees, with atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. It's hard to imagine living there. Yet NASA harbors a particularly intriguing notion for sending humans to study this formidable neighbor\u2014not an easy task given its harsh conditions but one that's survivable.\n\nThe author claims that confronting the challenges presented by Venus holds value not only for insights into the planet itself but also because human curiosity naturally drives us toward equally daunting quests. The path of discovery on Earth and beyond shouldn't be curtailed by dangers or doubts; rather, it should stretch to the very edges of imagination and innovation.\n\nThus, this article serves as an explanation by the author of both Venus's merits and drawbacks.\n\nIf relocating to another planet ever becomes necessary, my own view is that Venus might be preferable over others due to its closeness and similarity to Earth.",
        "The integration of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) within educational environments unveils a tapestry of compelling prospects and notable apprehensions for contemporary pedagogy. While this cutting-edge technology proffers unparalleled insights into student involvement and emotional states, its incorporation in classrooms necessitates meticulous contemplation of both its merits and potential pitfalls.\n\nThe capacity to automatically discern and scrutinize students' facial expressions could furnish instructors with invaluable real-time assessments regarding their pedagogical efficacy. In instances where learners exhibit perplexity or disinterest, educators could promptly fine-tune their teaching approaches or tempo to better cater to their charges. This innovation holds particular promise in sprawling classroom milieus where individual pupil supervision proves arduous, or in virtual learning spheres where traditional visual hints may prove elusive. Moreover, the methodical aggregation of emotional responsiveness data might unveil recurrent trends in student engagement across diverse subjects or instructional techniques, conceivably paving the way for more efficacious educational methodologies.\n\nNonetheless, the introduction of FACS within school premises raises grave ethical and pragmatic qualms that demand attention. Students may experience unease knowing that their countenances are under perpetual surveillance, potentially fostering an ambiance of scrutiny that could stifle organic learning behaviors and spontaneous participation. Furthermore, emotional manifestations are profoundly idiosyncratic and culturally imbued, rendering standardized interpretation thorny. Some pupils might maintain impassive visages despite being deeply absorbed while others may grin or nod courteously even when grappling with comprehension issues.

        "Ever have a happy feeling where you can't stop smiling or felt that lack of happiness to where you may possibly cry? Those are part of your learning experience, something every student has.  Dr. Carol Dweck has created valuable research to help show a student's learning mindset. Dr. Lisa Son helps us reveal much of the science of learning.\n\nYour brain is fraught with billions of neurons. These neurons connect in various ways to show learning as well as other activities used by your brain.  These connections have been theorized into different learning models to help educators show someone's different learning styles. Dr. Carol Dweck, a prominent researcher in learning mindsets, has classified two basic mindsets \u2013 growth mindset and fixed mindset \u2013 and then associated each with characteristic responses to challenges. For example, when you embrace challenges, you demonstrate a growth mindset, showing that you're open to learning. You use your prefrontal cortex\u2026 enabling me to learn.\n\nCreating and strengthening different neural  pathways to develop different learning approaches can actually make you learn in that certain way. According to the Growth Mindset Theory of Learning, developing a growth mindset not only expresses a willingness to learn, but also may even help produce better learning outcomes. A renowned educator, Maria Montessori, had her students engage in hands-on activities as a way of creating these learning experiences. In the classroom a teacher may have his or her students try different approaches to problem-solving to help their students develop a growth mindset. In the beginning of class a teacher may use an example of someone persevering through a difficult task and having the students reflect on its implications to positively improve the learning mindsets of the students during class.\n\nEducational research has its value in observing, understanding, and improving learning mindsets that can be expressed by students in a classroom.

This assertion is fortified by meticulous scrutiny of high-resolution images and scientific evaluations conducted during subsequent missions like the Mars Global Surveyor and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.\n\nThese sophisticated ventures have yielded detailed portrayals that divulge the true nature of this formation as nothing more than a weathered mesa or butte, akin to geological features seen on our own planet. The interplay of shadows and lighting at the time of Viking 1\u2019s original snapshot may have engendered an illusion of facial characteristics, yet upon closer examination, no traces of artificial craftsmanship are discernible. Furthermore, the topography surrounding this enigma adheres to natural erosion patterns, corroborating its organic genesis theory. Thus, despite kindling imaginations far and wide, it becomes evident that the Face on Mars emerges from terrestrial processes rather than otherworldly intervention.",
        "In delving into the enigmatic case of the enigmatic \"Face on Mars,\" it is imperative to heed the scientific elucidation and evaluations furnished by NASA and assorted celestial expositor institutions. This countenance, initially captured by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976, has been shrouded in a veil of conjecture, with conjectural musings speculating its origins as potential manifestations of primordial extraterrestrial actions. Nonetheless, a meticulous scrutiny of both visual depictions and geological statistics vehemently suggests that this seemingly visage-bearing entity is naught but an indigenous terrestrial configuration.\n\nDetailed scrutiny through high-definition imagery courtesy of the Mars Global Surveyor during the late 1990s till early 2000s unveiled that this ostensible \"Face\" is, indeed, an elevation apparelled with semblances to human features specifically discernible under certain vantage points and luminous ambiances. This perceptual phenomenon termed pareidolia denotes a customary cognitive inclination where our cerebral faculties perceive commonplace structures in arrant random patterns. Furthermore, anatomical attributes within this locality, encompassing wear patterns from erosion activities alongside manifest companionship with akin formations, incontrovertibly buttress assertions that this perplexing entity epitomizes components resultant from nature's unfettered mechanisms instead of artificially contrived machinations.\n\nErgo, notwithstanding how magnetically alluring the allure encapsulating the \"Face on Mars\" may seem\u2014scientific evidentiary corroboration resoundingly affirms its natural genesis sculpted over eons by analogous forces at play fashioning Mar's unearthly panorama.",
        "With the development of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which translates the emotional significance of facial expressions into a coding system, we can better appreciate the depth of\u2002human emotion, particularly in the classroom. This sends me to\u2002the story \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" which states that this technology can accurately analyze facial expressions and determine a person's emotional state. This could change the way we teach in the classroom by providing immediate insights into when students feel bored, confused, excited or engaged\u2002by a lesson. For example, if a student looks confused or bored, the teacher could slow down or change the lesson in a way that better serves\u2002the student. Instant emotion recognition opens doors\u2002to more personalized learning experiences that meet the students at their educational and emotional needs and adapt on the fly with every answer and student interaction.\n\nBut deploying\u2002FACS in the classroom also poses major ethical and practical challenges. A main concern is the risk\u2002of privacy encroachment. Students\u2002may not like the idea that every look on their face is being logged and analyzed. This could foster a climate of always having to be on guard, which would\u2002hamper natural emotional expression and create a less open and supportive learning climate. Additionally, the technology may not be reliable, especially in diverse classrooms in which cultural\u2002differences in facial expressions can be significant. It could also lead to misconcepts of what students are feeling, which could result in prescriptions\u2002that exacerbate the problem, rather than solving it.\n\nAnother\u2002factor is the misuse of data collected by FACS. Educational institutions and schools should be proactive about protecting this sensitive information\u2002on students. Emotional data might be misused for things like disciplinary actions (i.e. marking for academic dishonesty) or even be exploited commercially, which is extremely harmful and should be avoided at all\u2002costs. If\u2002this data is accessed by a company, they might use it to run advertisements or other marketing tactics targeting those students, which can be very unethical and harmful for the kids and their welfare, for example.\n\nFirst and foremost, although the Facial Action Coding System seems inherently promising and capable in\u2002providing teachers the sublime ability to understand the emotional lives of their students, its unique potential for use in the classroom must be handled with extreme care.",

        "Wow, the face on Mars looks so much like a human's. It has eyes, a nose, and even a mouth. It's weird that on Mars there's nothing much around, yet you find something shaped like that. A lot of folks think aliens might have been there or even live there now. But I reckon it\u2019s just another natural landform since there's no alien monument up there.\n\nFirst off, the face on Mars is really popular among people. It's shown up in Hollywood films, books, magazines\u2014even radio talks about it! Maybe we just ain't gotten close enough to see if it's flat or more like a mountain. There's definitely plenty going on up there on Mars. The date May 24, 2001, is big in history for many.\n\nNext up, I\u2019d say it's just another natural landform 'cause when you look at the shadowing it sometimes seems pyramid-like. If you check out those shadows real close you'll notice how pointed it ain't at the top\u2014kind of suggests that what they're calling eyes could be holes where water used to flow and the mouth might just be some crack.\n\nFinally, if we got closer scientists from NASA might confirm and tell us more clearly what's going on with this feature we're always seeing from afar. They can\u2019t know everything by only looking straight-on; they need side views too for full understanding! They'll decide better whether there's any alien connection when viewed more closely\u2014but until then it's likely just terrain since no one's found any alien monuments yet.",
        "Instead of an artificial product of the ancient alien civilization, \"The Face on Mars\" is a natural landform. This claim has been supported by strong scientific evidence and deductions. Being a NASA scientist, on the Cydonia region of Mars, home to the Face, I have done thorough research. A key factor to support the natural formation theory is the geological environment of the Face, with its chaotic terrain featuring mesas, buttes, and other erosional structures formed over millions of years through wind, water, and ice erosion. The symmetrical Face is a mesa formed by these natural processes.\n\nThis natural explanation is further reinforced by additional evidence provided by the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\". As high-resolution photos captured by the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal, the so-called facial structure is only the work of shadow and lighting effects. These photos provide multiple-angled views that indicate the obvious symmetry and features are merely the results of light interacting with eroded rock. In addition, in this article the author notes the absence of any nearby evidence suggesting an intelligent structure or ancient civilization. Features like the layering and fractures of the rocks comply with natural geological processes.  \n\nTo summarize, instead of a product of alien civilization, the Face on Mars is the perfect example of a natural landform formed by geological processes over time.",

The societal costs associated with such extensive unemployment deserve serious consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, although driverless cars possess undeniable allure with their promise of innovation and efficiency, their potential hazards along with societal ramifications are too critical to disregard lightly. Until robust measures are established to tackle issues surrounding malfunctions, ethical decision-making frameworks are devised adequately addressing moral complexities posed by these vehicles\u2014and until strategies mitigating job disruptions are formulated\u2014adopting a cautious stance towards developing this technology is essential.",
        "Having encountered a multitude of individuals within my work as a NASA scientist, I have been met with the unwavering belief that the enigmatic Face on Mars is an artificial construct crafted by extraterrestrial entities. However, through extensive research and meticulous data analysis, I remain resolute in my conviction that the Face is purely a product of natural geology. The allure of alien intervention in forming this feature is undeniably captivating, yet the dearth of substantive evidence to substantiate this hypothesis renders it untenable.\n\nMy stance derives from several pivotal considerations, encompassing Mars' geological evolution and the profound impact of erosion on shaping its terrain over eons. As detailed in the publication \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" Cydonia\u2014wherein lies the enigmatic visage\u2014has undergone transformative alterations owing to seismic activity and aqueous processes. The article posits that \"the face-like shape can be elucidated through amalgamated natural phenomena like erosion and faulting.\" This compelling narrative implies that far from being an intentional artifact, the Face is instead an intricate outcome of elemental forces sculpting Mars' topography.\n\nIn conclusion, while the notion of a Martian countenance handcrafted by aliens sparks our imagination, grounding conclusions in empirical facts remains imperative. The geological chronicle of Mars intertwined with erosive vicissitudes and tectonic dynamics furnishes reasonable explication for how the enigmatic effigy came into existence. Echoed within scholarly discourse\u2014\"the face-like shape can be explained by natural processes\"\u2014bolsters my assertion that indeed, what we behold is a relic borne out of celestial craftsmanship. By delving into empirical underpinnings and entertaining alternate hypotheses judiciously, we can confidently assert no necessity exists to invoke extraterrestrial artistry to clarify this beguiling Martian marvel.",
        "In the rapidly shifting world of technology, innovations like the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) have transformed our comprehension of human emotions. The article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" delves into how these technological strides have enabled computers to decode and interpret an array of emotional expressions on people's faces. While this breakthrough shows potential in domains such as market research and psychology, its implementation in educational environments, particularly classrooms, remains a hotly debated issue. Advocates maintain that employing FACS technology to scrutinize students' emotional signals can lead to improved learning outcomes by allowing educators to customize their teaching approaches accordingly. For example, pinpointing when a student feels perplexed or disengaged can prompt teachers to deliver timely interventions or adapt their instructional methods, thereby nurturing a more inclusive and effective educational landscape.\n\nConversely, critics voice concerns over the ethical ramifications and privacy challenges tied to deploying facial recognition technology in academic settings. They assert that applying FACS for monitoring students' emotional states might violate their right to privacy and autonomy within schools.

From curbing traffic mishaps to enhancing mobility options for the elderly and differently-abled, autonomous vehicles stand on the brink of reshaping our modes of travel and existence.\n\nThe most compelling argument advocating for driverless cars resides in their capacity to save lives. According to recent findings, human error is responsible for more than 90% of road accidents annually, leading to countless avoidable fatalities. Equipped with sophisticated sensors and artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles boast superior information processing capabilities compared to human drivers. They never succumb to distractions, fatigue or impairment - offering a heightened level of road safety. Furthermore, such vehicles streamline traffic circulation by fostering seamless communication with other automobiles and infrastructural elements - thereby mitigating congestion and emissions woes.

        "I'll help you rewrite the text about autonomous vehicles to match the style, tone, and expression of the reference text about Venus. Here's my attempt:\n\nThe development of self-driving cars is something that many people think we should study and work on. There are many reasons why people think we should develop these cars, no matter what the problems or dangers might be. I think it would be good to develop self-driving cars because they could make driving more like how safe transportation should be.\n\nSelf-driving cars are often called \"robot drivers,\" and they are becoming more common on our roads besides regular cars. These cars are also called \"autonomous vehicles\" because sometimes they can drive all by themselves. The way humans and self-driving cars operate is very different, although experts think that at one point, all cars could be self-driving, with no accidents, and could be very close to how we imagine perfect transportation. Self-driving cars still have features that make them similar to regular cars.\n\nSelf-driving cars now have a different way of working. The technology is more complex and uses many computers and sensors. Companies have tried to develop self-driving cars in the past, but no car could drive completely by itself for more than a few test runs. Some companies have not tried to make fully self-driving cars for many years. In self-driving cars, the computer processes over 100 decisions per second. The technology is far more advanced. Self-driving cars have the most advanced safety features of any other vehicle.\n\nCompanies eventually want to make all cars self-driving, although they would not be able to remove human drivers completely.",
        "The article outlines the benefits and drawbacks of driverless cars\u2002with deep analysis. As with many breakthroughs, challenges are to be accepted, however, in my\u2002opinion we should embrace the automation of road vehicles based on the substantial positive changes it would bring to road safety, throughput and accessibility. The\u2002article describes how these autonomous vehicles could save lives by reducing traffic accidents, as well as save people money by improving their fuel efficiency, and provide transportation to people who are unable to drive for reasons related to age or disability.\n\nOf the many\u2002strong arguments made for the introduction of driverless cars, the potential for huge improvements in road safety is one of the most persuasive. As the article points\u2002out, human error is responsible for over 90 percent of traffic accidents. By substituting error-prone human drivers\u2002with a sophisticated piece of technology that can process data and make instantaneous decisions, then the amount of accidents would likely decrease significantly. Self-driving cars are outfitted with both a variety of sensors and software that are designed to avoid crashes, capable of reacting faster than any human ever\u2002could. In addition to improving safety, these vehicles may also\u2002have some environmental benefits due to better fuel efficiency. Driverless cars, the article says, are programmed to run at optimal speeds and also utilize automated braking that reduces unnecessary acceleration and deceleration (and therefore fuel consumption\u2002and emissions). This conservation not only saves\u2002energy sources, but it also reduces the carbon footprint of daily commutes, providing a unified source of pollution for urban areas.\n\nThough you do have to worry about people currently doing jobs based around cars losing employment and the high initial investment into this type of tech, the gains to be made are\u2002more than just this; being able to offer greater access to people is a major incentive to driving big. The article notes that self-driving cars can transform the lives of both disabled individuals and the elderly, allowing them greater\u2002independence and mobility. People in these demographics tend not to be able to drive and need\u2002to rely on public transport or other people for transit, which reduces access to essential services or opportunities. Driver-less cars are doing away with this barrier, enabling a practical way for all people to participate\u2002more fully in society.",
        "I am opposed to the advancement of autonomous vehicles for a series of compelling reasons.\n\nForemost among these is the fundamental issue of safety. The unpredictable nature of driving conditions poses inherent risks that even the most sophisticated technology may struggle to navigate. Factors such as driver inattentiveness, icy road surfaces, or construction zones can easily confound a driverless car's abilities. Imagine the potential consequences should you succumb to drowsiness while relying on autonomous driving\u2014the prospect of more accidents, possible fatalities, and legal repercussions for reckless behavior looms ominously.\n\nA second key concern revolves around the impact on employment opportunities. The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles threatens numerous livelihoods across various sectors\u2014from automobile dealerships and valet services to airport parking attendants\u2014casting a shadow over job security for many individuals within the automotive industry. The ripple effect could lead to widespread economic upheaval, potentially leaving countless workers without viable sources of income.\n\nLastly, there's the significant issue of resource allocation. Why invest substantial resources into acquiring a self-driving vehicle when operating it yourself remains a feasible option? This raises questions about societal values and personal responsibility: Are we truly so indolent that we require automation in every aspect of our lives? Moreover, those involved in producing these autonomous cars stand to face financial losses as resources are diverted towards an arguably unnecessary pursuit.\n\nIn summary, I firmly contend that pursuing driverless cars represents an unfounded waste\u2014both in terms of time and financial resources\u2014that could be more prudently spent elsewhere.",
        "Here's an enriched version with more varied language and sophisticated expression:\n\nEmbarking on the Seagoing Cowboys expedition proved to be a transformative odyssey\u2014one I wholeheartedly endorse for kindred spirits yearning for both adventure and meaningful impact. This extraordinary endeavor transported me to the far reaches of our planet, immersing me in a tapestry of cultures that challenged and expanded my worldview. As we traversed the mighty oceans, our mission transcended mere navigation; we served as maritime ambassadors, shepherding vital livestock to communities rebuilding from the ravages of war, weaving threads of hope through our humanitarian efforts.\n\nBeneath celestial canopies, an ineffable bond flourished among our seafaring brotherhood. We exchanged tales that echoed across moonlit waves, forging connections that would weather the tests of time. Perhaps most profound was witnessing the raw emotion in recipients' eyes as our precious cargo reached distant shores\u2014a poignant reminder of humanity's intrinsic interconnectedness.",
        "By presenting evidence of the danger that Venus poses, the author of \"The\u2002Challenge of Exploring Venus\" creates an effective argument in favor of why Venus is worth exploring. Venus is an extremely inhospitable environment, with surface temperatures peaking at 462\u00b0C, making it one of the least welcoming spots in the solar system and the article shines\u2002a light on that. However, the author posits that this extreme environment actually renders Venus a compelling subject for study,\u2002as its dense atmosphere and volcanic surface could provide useful information on the planet's geological past. In the book, the author reviews on how we are not just able to study Venus, as we had\u2002already proven through our successful Venera missions with the Soviet Union, but that studying Venus would bring bountiful science findings, if only we want to try it. Overall, the author's use of evidence and examples effectively illustrates that the benefits of\u2002studying Venus outweigh the risks and makes a compelling case for continued exploration and research.",
        "The mysterious geological feature on Mars, dubbed the \"Face on Mars,\" has captivated the imaginations of many since its discovery in 1976, leading some to hypothesize it was artificially constructed by an alien civilization. However, as a NASA scientist who has extensively studied this formation, I am confident the Face was naturally formed by weathering processes over millions of years.\n\nThe original low-resolution image from the Viking orbiter that sparked theories of alien origins was taken at an angle contorting irregular depressions and ridges into the visage of a face. When NASA's Mars Global Surveyor obtained high-definition photographs of the same locale in 1998 and 2001, they revealed the true nature of this curious terrain - an ordinary eroded mesa comparable to the countless other wind-sculpted rock formations pocking Mars' ochre plains. The supposed \"eyes,\" \"nose,\" and \"mouth\" that seemed lifelike in the grainy Viking photo could now be seen as simply the results of Martian weather wearing irregularly on strata of varying resilience.\n\nFurthermore, the Face's placement in the Cydonia region supports its natural origins. This locality includes many mesas akin to the enigma, fashioned through erosion as sandborne grit ground relentlessly against the bedrock, grinding meeker minerals into dust while basalts endured. Some still claim the formation's symmetry implies artificial construction, but close inspection reveals any semblance of symmetry to be an optical trick born of low resolution rather than precise engineering.",
        "The Face on Mars was seen in a Viking 1 Orbiter picture taken in 1976 and by far the most excuse to cause intriguing speculation but ultimately mistaken speculation regarding natural versus\u2002synthetic on Mars. While some people think it\u2019s a giant sculpture that has been made by an alien civilization, as a scientist at NASA, I can assure you with confidence that it is a mere landform created\u2002by nature.\n\nFirst, the original photos shot in 1976 were shot at\u2002an angle and in lighting conditions that also created the appearance of a face. This common phenomenon, called pareidolia, is the way the brain processes abstract, visual information and interprets it\u2002as something familiar like a person or a face. This is an important point, as it explains why the Face\u2002image appeared so stark and human-like.\n\nSecond, higher resolution images have repeatedly been taken by several subsequent missions, including in 1998\u2002and 2001 by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) of the same spot. These images reveal that the \u201cFace\u201d is literally a hill featuring a number of components that just don\u2019t look like a face from any\u2002other angle. For instance, images from the MGS show the rocky ground, a feature common to atmospherically influenced landforms on Mars and\u2002elsewhere in the solar system.\n\nIn addition, geological studies confirm the natural origin\u2002theory This conflation was countered by scientists studying the Cydonia region, which is known for its wind- or water-eroded mesas and hills \u2014 common geological features shaped\u2002by natural processes over millions of years. The hill that looks like a face was sculpted by the same processes that shape other landforms in\u2002the region.\n\nMartian terrain is also affected by frequent dust storms\u2002and wind that change land over time. This constant presence of natural elements means that no manmade structure can sit unaltered or intact\u2002for millions of years.",

        "Here's my rewrite of your text, following the style and structure of the reference text:\n\nIn the article \"Driverless Cars are Coming,\" the author discusses how autonomous vehicles could transform transportation and their potential impact on society. This technology on our roads will not be beneficial because it poses safety risks, threatens jobs, and creates complex ethical challenges.\n\nIn paragraph 4 the author states \"Even a minor programming error could result in fatal accidents.\" Regular human drivers can make split-second decisions based on instinct and experience, but autonomous vehicles rely on complex algorithms that can fail. When these systems malfunction, the consequences are severe, as demonstrated by several test vehicle crashes mentioned in the article. Also, the widespread implementation of this technology would require extensive infrastructure changes and updates to our current road systems.\n\nIn paragraph 8 of the article the author discusses how \"millions of professional drivers could face unemployment.\" This massive job displacement would affect truck drivers, taxi operators, and delivery personnel who depend on driving for their livelihood. The technology removes these workers' ability to earn a living, forcing them to seek new careers in an increasingly automated job market.",
        "Here's an enriched version of the text with more sophisticated language and varied structures while maintaining the core message:\n\nIn \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author crafts a compelling narrative that champions the pursuit of Venusian exploration, deftly balancing the formidable obstacles with the tantalizing prospects it presents.

        "As a NASA scientist, I firmly contend that the so-called \"Face on Mars\" is merely a naturally occurring landform, not a sign of alien construction. The article Unmasking the Face on Mars offers persuasive evidence that challenges extraterrestrial interpretations. It demonstrates that the feature in question displays typical geological traits\u2014such as erosion patterns and the interplay of natural shadows\u2014that can easily create deceptive illusions. Moreover, the phenomenon of pareidolia, where our brains tend to recognize familiar shapes in random visual stimuli, provides a rational explanation for why some observers might mistakenly perceive a human-made structure.\n\nRecent high-resolution imagery captured by advanced Mars missions further undermines the alien hypothesis by revealing the feature as an unremarkable mesa with no signs of deliberate design. This body of evidence underscores the importance of relying on robust scientific data and logical analysis rather than succumbing to sensational claims. In essence, the Face on Mars is a captivating example of natural geological processes at work over millennia, and a proper understanding of these processes helps dispel the myth of extraterrestrial intervention.",

        "Utilizing the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to decipher the emotional cues of students in a classroom situation poses a intricate ethical dilemma imbued with both promising advantages and profound detriments. Advocates may posit that such technological integration could bestow invaluable insights into student engagement and comprehension, thereby facilitating educators to customize their teaching approaches and dispense personalized assistance. Notwithstanding, the underlying risk of misconstrual and exploitation raises substantial apprehensions. The discourse entitled \"Eliciting Mona Lisa's Smile\" accentuates FACS's adeptness in discerning subtle intricacies within facial expressions, intimating its capacity to identify students grappling with subject matter or feeling disconnected from the learning process. Theoretically speaking, this intelligence could endow instructors with an opportunity for timely intervention and targeted support, potentially warding off academic setbacks for individuals.\n\nHowever, the premise that distinct facial cues unfailingly align with exact emotions presents a conundrum of sorts. Variances rooted in culture, individual idiosyncrasies, and the fluidity inherent in emotional manifestations engender a perceptible margin for misjudgment. A pupil's furrowed brow might signify perplexity, contemplation at depth or simply an abiding headache; yet FACS\u2014bereft of human observers' nuanced acuity\u2014runs the peril of interpreting such visual indicators inaccurately leading to unwarranted interventions. Moreover, the perpetual surveillance ingrained in this technological apparatus casts a pall on classroom dynamics which might smother candid expression and critical cogitation by fostering pervasive hesitance among students aware they are under unceasing scrutiny\u2014disincentivizing dissenting viewpoints or authentic displays of sentiment hence impeding their intellectual growth and personal evolution.\n\nThe ramifications regarding privacy loom large as well broaching salient concerns about data protection protocols alongside potential algorithmic biases perpetuating extant disparities.",
        "The \"Face on Mars\" has long captivated the public and generated conjecture about alien societies. Many people thought that the first pictures of this strange landform were proof of an alien monument. I have done extensive research on this landform as a NASA scientist, and I would like to present scientific proof that clarifies its origins. The \"Face\" is a naturally occurring geological feature that was produced by a mix of human pattern recognition and lighting, defying the alien notion. The evidence that is now available strongly supports this natural explanation.\n\nThe first low-resolution photos captured by the Viking spacecraft gave rise to the hypothesis of an alien structure. When paired with particular lighting conditions, these photos produced shadows that resembled facial features. Many people thought the \"Face\" was an alien monument because of this visual illusion and the human propensity to see patterns. When evaluating confusing images, individuals frequently exhibit pareidolia, the tendency to see faces in random patterns.\n\nThe Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft has just released high-resolution photos that have improved our understanding of the \"Face.\" What at first glance looks like a face in these photos is actually a mesa, a flat-topped landform that is typical on Mars. The mesa's features are quite similar to those of other mesas on Mars, and it has been eroded over time by wind and probably water. The illusion that the landform was a human-like face was produced by the interaction of light and shadow as well as the human propensity to see faces.\n\nThere are serious logistical and scientific issues with the notion that aliens might build such a large building. The construction of a face-shaped mesa would require resources and technology far beyond what we presently understand, and there is no additional indication of extraterrestrial activity on Mars.",
        "The so-called \"Face on Mars,\" initially thought by some to offer proof of otherworldly life, is actually a natural geological formation. Captured in a 1976 photograph taken by the Viking 1 orbiter, this site sparked widespread debate regarding possible alien involvement owing to its apparent likeness to a human visage. However, further examination and later missions have provided compelling evidence that this feature is merely an optical illusion caused by natural processes.\n\nCentral to disproving the alien theory are higher-definition images captured subsequently by spacecraft including the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These images uncover that what seemed like exact facial attributes are in fact irregularities in rock structures and shadows cast under precise lighting conditions. As light shifts throughout the Martian day, these shadows change dramatically, sometimes entirely erasing the look of facial features.\n\nIn addition, geological experts recognize other common formations on Earth that can generate similar deceptions without involvement from intelligent entities. For instance, pareidolia\u2014our tendency to see familiar shapes where none exist\u2014has been thoroughly documented; clouds often mimic recognizable objects purely due to our imaginative interpretations rather than planned design. The Face on Mars essentially amounts to an extension of this phenomenon exacerbated by shading at specific angles along Mesozoic-era plateaus.",

        "As a new technology to interpret student emotions in the classroom, Facial Action Coding System (FACS) has restricted practical value while creating a complicated ethical dilemma. Supporters state that by recognizing students with boredom, confusion or frustration, FACS enables teachers to customize their instruction. However, the significant limitations in relating facial expressions to real emotional states are highlighted in the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\". FACS usually relies on the interpretation of specific muscle movements, that do not always represent underlying emotions. A student could frown because of concentration, but the system might misinterpret it as frustration.\n\nFurthermore, reliance on FACS could possibly increase student anxiety and sabotage the trust between students and teachers  by causing misdiagnoses and inappropriate interventions. It is already subtle and complicated in a classroom context; a new technology that simplifies expressions and emotions to pre-programmed interpretations may degrade these interactions. In the end, it can sabotage instead of promoting the learning process. \n\nThe possible misuse and misinterpretation of FACS outweigh the potential benefits in an educational context. Educators should put more importance on open communication and genuine interaction with students instead of using technology to interpret often vague facial expressions, in a way to measure their understanding and emotional well-being.",
        "Mars' Face on Mars has intrigued people for many decades and start discussions about its origin. Some people think it serves as evidence from a lost alien civilization while other people say it looks more like a natural feature. As a NASA scientist, I have investigated this phenomenon in great detail and can positively state that the Face on Mars appears through natural processes. Research and examinations performed multiple space agencies support this conclusion.    Scientific observations backed by multiple space agencies play a major role in proving that the Face on Mars exists naturally. Spacecraft like the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) produced high-resolution photos which show that low-resolution images from earlier missions such as Viking 1 in 1976 create a face-like appearance. The MGS photos demonstrate that this \"face\" consists of multiple distinctive geological elements which match ordinary Martian geological events. Martian wind and dust storms cause natural erosion which leads to the formation of detailed patterns on Martian landforms. Lighting conditions together with shadow effects significantly affect how these structures appear to our eyes from particular angles. 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' examines how light variations produce significant changes in our visual interpretation of these Martian landforms.    Planetary scientists' geomorphological analyses serve to enhance the evidence supporting natural origin of these formations. Planetary scientists studied Martian landforms throughout the planet and discovered similar geological features which do not have face or artificial object shapes when viewed up close. Large Martian plateaus have formed throughout Martian geography because sedimentary layers have eroded through time. The article explains that mesas throughout Mars vary in form because their geological makeup and wind and dust devil exposure differ. Natural processes created this appearance because the \"Face\" matches typical Martian geological features rather than extraterrestrial construction.",
        "Delving into Venus, the planet just a stone's throw away from Earth, presents formidable hurdles owing to its harsh conditions.

        "The author believes that studying Venus is a worthwhile endeavor, even with the dangers involved.  He backs this up by pointing out that Venus was once much like Earth.  This kind of research expands what we know about the planet and pushes us to develop better technology for space travel.\n\nA long time ago, Venus might have been similar to Earth.  The planet is dangerous, but scientists are still interested in how it might have been Earth's sister planet.  The text says, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.\"",
        "Data\u2002is limited only to October 2023. This claim ONGOING with saying that the Face is a man-made object\u2002from a previous civilization that used to inhabit Mars. But as a scientist at NASA, I can tell you personally that the Face is simply the result of natural processes acting on the\u2002Moon\u2019s surface.\n\nFirst, we have high-resolution images of the\u2002Face taken by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) in 1998. But these new, higher-res images, taken in the spring/summer of 2001, finally show that the Face is not a face at all, but\u2002rather a mesa\u2014a flat-topped hill. The light and angle of the original Viking image made it appear maternal or feminine, but a closer look right there indicates a rocky, uneven surface that shows no\u2002examples of any man-made structures.\n\nIn addition, the geology of the Cydonia area, home of\u2002the Face, suggests a natural cause as well. The region is\u2002characterized by numerous mesas and buttes, common landforms formed by the erosion of stratified sedimentary rock. The formation known\u2002as Face on Mars also appears consistent with this geology, and its discovery has helped to solidify the idea that it is a geological formation rather than a face.\n\nThe Face also does not have the internal or systematic structure you\u2002would expect from something artificial. Unlike structures on the planet Earth, such as the pyramids or Stonehenge that display symmetry and indications of careful construction, the Face on Mars lacks direct confirmation\u2002of symmetry or human hands shaping the geological aspect. It actually looks like an\u2002arbitrary, weathered rock pile, like so many other geological features found on Mars.\n\nThe Face, they argue, fits into one large, structured matrix of information on\u2002top of the Martian surface that must have been laid out with intention. However, using geological surveys and\u2002satellite images, no discernible patterns or structures have been discovered to corroborate this claim. Cydonia region structures consistent with\u2002natural randomness of erosion and deposition processes.\n\nThat is in addition to the\u2002absence of any supporting evidence for an advanced Kahless Martian civilization. For the Face to be an artificial\u2002structure, we would not expect it to be alone without any artifacts, ruins, or anything to indicate civilization.",
        "I think that driverless cars are good because they can stop accidents from happening because they don't make mistakes like people do, which is why most accidents happen.  Driverless cars are really good at driving and they always look around with special cameras and computers that don't get sleepy or look at their phones or drink too much.  They also can help old people and people who can't drive get around, which makes them more free and happy.

        "In \"Facial Recognition in the Classroom: A Double-Edged Sword,\" the author suggests that using FACS to study student emotions is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because it offers potential benefits for personalized learning, much like individualized instruction benefits students.  There are some similarities between effective teaching and FACS analysis, which means there could be advantages to using FACS in classrooms. If FACS is beneficial and things are the same as individualized learning, teachers could use FACS to improve instruction. Educators should study FACS because they could find more similarities between effective teaching and FACS analysis, there could be ways to mitigate the risks of FACS, and we could one day use FACS responsibly in classrooms.\n\nIf educators studied FACS they could find many more similarities to effective teaching practices. On paragraph 1 it says, \"This individualized approach could be particularly beneficial for students who struggle to articulate their emotional state,\" this means that FACS is pretty much like personalized tutoring, they have so many similarities.  On paragraph 2 it mentions, \"The potential for early intervention and personalized learning offered by this technology is undoubtedly appealing,\" what this quote... using FACS, there was probably a way to make it work for students long ago.\n\nIf educators study FACS they could find out if it's safe to use or if it's too dangerous for students' privacy. On paragraph 3 it says, \"The constant monitoring of students\u2019 faces creates an environment of surveillance,\" this is telling us that using FACS could be very challenging. On paragraph 4 it says, \"The lack of explicit consent and the potential for biased algorithms further exacerbate the ethical dilemmas,\"  this quote is saying that it is something very extreme for student privacy. It might be very dangerous for us to use FACS, but there could be advantages to the technology.",

        "The so-called \u201cFace on Mars\u201d has long captured\u2002imaginations, fueling speculation about otherworldly civilizations. But as a NASA scientist, I can tell you that this fascinating structure is the result of natural\u2002geological processes, not extraterrestrial craftsmanship. The evidence mustered for this claim is compelling, dispelling the idea of\u2002human tinkering.\n\nFirst, the original image taken\u2002by the Viking orbiter in 1976 was low resolution and open to interpretation. These shadowing effects produced the illusion of eyes and a nose \u2014 just as they do on human faces \u2014 and\u2002with that, the perception of a face. Later pictures taken by higher resolution cameras, such as the\u2002Mars Global Surveyor, show a much more eroded and less face-like mesa. It shows how lighting\u2002and image quality can completely change perception.\n\nAdditionally, Cydonia is not a flat region\u2002\u2013 it has mesa-like formations. These table mountains, eroded by wind into their current forms over\u2002millions of years, are a common feature on Mars. The \u201cFace\u201d of the\u2002\u201cDevil\u201d is perfectly in accordance with the local geology, showing the same layer cake and erosional face as local mesas. That\u2002indicates a common ancestry through natural processes.\n\nThus, the\u2002initial picture of the \"Face on Mars\" remains, though it made for a signifi\u00adcant deal of excite\u00adment as well as apoc\u00adalyptic con\u00adjecture, due to its erro\u00adneous as well as ten\u00adta\u00adtive nature\u2013but even\u00adtu\u00adal greater analy\u00adsis has provided a more plea\u00adsur\u00adable response. The recent better images and\u2002understanding of the geology of Mars make it absolutely clear that the \u201cFace\u201d is just a natural landform, the result of the erosive power of wind, and no monument erected by aliens architects.",
        "Automated vehicles, as delineated in the article \"The Oncoming Era of Automated Vehicles,\" harbor the potential to revolutionize transportation, yet their progress is riddled with obstacles.

The technological prowess underpinning self-driving cars is remarkable; nonetheless, the perils stemming from potential glitches and cyber breaches demand due consideration.\n\nA pivotal issue underscored in the discourse pertains to safety. Notwithstanding that autonomous vehicles are meticulously programmed to adhere to traffic regulations, they may falter when confronted with unforeseen circumstances or capricious human drivers on the thoroughfare. The author illustrates instances where automated systems erred in object detection, culminating in avoidable mishaps that a vigilant human operator could have averted. Moreover, there looms a substantial menace from malevolent actors seeking to exploit susceptibilities in these sophisticated frameworks. Such vulnerabilities underscore why it is imperative to prioritize further enhancement prior to broad-scale deployment of these automobiles.\n\nIn summation, while driverless cars epitomize an imaginable future brimful of promises such as mitigated traffic congestion and reduced emissions delineated in the narrative, these advantages do not eclipse extant drawbacks related to safety and security predicaments. Until these barriers are assiduously surmounted through comprehensive testing and technological headways, embracing self-driving vehicles wholeheartedly would be premature and potentially hazardous.",
        "Here's a rewrite of the NASA text in the informal, conversational style of the reference text:\n\nThe Face on Mars is a big deal for people who are interested in space stuff. A lot of people think this thing we saw in some pictures from 1976 was made by aliens, but that's not really true.\n\nMe personally, I think that the Face is just rocks and dirt that look weird in the pictures. The reason that people got confused is becouse the first pictures weren't very good quality. When NASA took better pictures later, you could see it's not really a face at all - it's just some hills that had shadows making them look like a face.\n\nThat couses a problem between people becouse some still want to believe it's made by aliens. But the truth is that when we got better cameras up there, we could see exactly what it really was. My second reason for not believing in the alien face is that our brains like to see faces in things, even when they're not really there. It's like when you see shapes in clouds.\n\nTheose are some of the reasons why I do not think the Face on Mars was made by aliens. The pictures prove it's just natural rocks and stuff. What do you think?",
        "Due to the extreme conditions and harsh environment, it is a difficult task to explore Venus. However, from the paper \u201cThe Challenge of Exploring Venus\u201d it is correctly pointed out that it is still a worthwhile effort to study the planet. This paper establishes that through the evidence presented, this claim is true. One other important aspect that has been raised is that Venus is important in the understanding of climate change on Earth. This is because, studying Venus\u2019 runaway greenhouse effect can give scientists a better understanding of how changes in atmospheric conditions of a planet can become drastic in a relatively short time as it has for Earth.  Furthermore, the author notes that solving the enigma of Venus will benefit the advancement of technology and space exploration. It is possible that the research on Venus will lead to the development of new technologies for spacecraft, materials and instruments that will not only benefit future missions to Venus, but also other interplanetary space flights. This is more of an encouragement to people to challenge themselves and try to overcome various challenges in order to enhance the knowledge and possibilities in the area of space exploration.  Therefore, in spite of the fact that the exploration of Venus is hazardous, the author correctly points out that the advantages of doing so significantly surpass the risks. Thus, the article properly emphasizes the value of exploring the unknown territories of Venus for the benefit of science, technology, and our understanding of climate change, and thus encourages the endeavor.",
        "The so-called \"Face on Mars,\" initially detected by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976, continues to intrigue many while mystifying scientists. Though some persist in believing it signifies an antiquated alien culture, as an analyst for NASA I can state with assurance that this panorama is simply a terrestrial formation. The countenance manifested principally owing to illumination circumstances and the perspective from which the picture was captured.\n\nCritical evidence supporting this position emerges from subsequent clearer imagery. High-resolution photographs secured by the Mars Global Surveyor in the latter 1990s and early 2000s unveiled the aesthetic to be an ordinary mound exhibiting no discernible facial attributes from alternating angles. Additionally, geological evaluation implies the region encompassing the aesthetic, Cydonia Mensae, is characterized by numerous roughly comparable landforms molded by erosion and other organic processes across millions of years. These discoveries align with what we fathom about Martian geology and vigorously propose that the aesthetic was not a premeditated development.\n\nIn summation, while understandable that some could observe human similarities in definite Martian landscapes owing to pareidolia\u2014a psychological phenomenon where we perceive familiar designs in arbitrary information\u2014the scientific proof evidently displays that the Face on Mars is a naturally occurring constitution. Continuing examination and imaging carry on to validate this comprehension, fortifying our knowledge of Mars as a planet formed by geological forces rather than bygone civilizations.",

        "The concept of an alien civilization sculpting a colossal visage into the Martian landscape has captivated the public imagination for decades.  However, as a NASA scientist, I can unequivocally assert that the so-called Face on Mars is nothing more than a naturally occurring geological feature.  When the Viking 1 orbiter initially captured images of the Cydonia region in 1976, the low-resolution photograph gave the impression of a face-like formation, prompting speculation about its artificiality.  This initial interpretation, however, was merely a manifestation of pareidolia \u2013 the human brain's propensity to perceive familiar patterns, especially faces, within random stimuli.  The indistinct, shadowed image, acquired from a specific vantage point under particular lighting, fostered an illusion that subsequent advancements in imaging technology have comprehensively dispelled.\n\nLater, high-resolution imagery from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and other contemporary spacecraft furnished conclusive proof of the Face's natural provenance. These detailed photographs unveil the \"Face\" to be an eroded mesa, a geological structure prevalent on both Earth and Mars.  The apparent symmetry so striking in the original Viking image vanishes when observed from alternative perspectives and with enhanced clarity. What were once perceived as eyes, a nose, and a mouth are, in reality, uneven ridges, impact craters, and the interplay of light and shadow characteristic of wind-sculpted rock formations.  The mesa, spanning approximately two kilometers, exhibits geological characteristics identical to numerous other mesas within the Cydonia region, all formed through natural erosional processes and sedimentary deposition over millennia.\n\nThe scientific arguments against artificial construction become irrefutable when the region's geological context is considered. The Face is but one of many analogous plateaus and mesas in Cydonia, each molded by the same natural forces that have shaped the Martian surface across vast geological epochs.  The surrounding terrain bears distinct markers of extensive wind erosion and potentially ancient water activity \u2013 processes capable of producing surprisingly geometric and seemingly ordered configurations.  Modern imaging methods, such as 3D terrain mapping, demonstrate that the Face's structure aligns perfectly with natural geological processes observed throughout our solar system.",
        "The integration of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) into educational environments brings with it a wealth of opportunities and notable concerns for contemporary teaching methodologies. Although this technology provides an unprecedented window into students' engagement levels and emotional states, its implementation demands a thoughtful evaluation of both its advantages and potential pitfalls.\n\nHarnessing the capability to automatically detect and interpret students' facial expressions can arm educators with invaluable real-time feedback on their teaching effectiveness. When signs of confusion or disengagement emerge among students, teachers could promptly adjust their instructional strategies or pacing, thereby enhancing comprehension and retention of the material. This technological advancement proves especially advantageous in large classroom settings where closely monitoring each student is challenging, as well as in virtual learning scenarios where traditional visual cues are less perceptible. Additionally, systematically gathering data on emotional responses could unveil patterns in student engagement across various subjects or pedagogical approaches, paving the way for more informed educational planning.\n\nNevertheless, deploying FACS within classrooms introduces significant ethical and practical dilemmas that merit careful deliberation. The knowledge that one's facial expressions are under constant scrutiny might make students uneasy, fostering an environment akin to surveillance that may stifle natural learning behaviors and hinder spontaneous participation. Moreover, given the substantial variation in emotional expressions across different cultures and individual personalities, standardized interpretation risks being problematic or misleading. The technology might inadvertently burden students with maintaining \"appropriate\" facial expressions rather than allowing them to focus on genuine learning experiences.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) represents a groundbreaking advancement in the realm of affective computing, fundamentally transforming how machines perceive and decipher human emotions.  In \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explores this state-of-the-art system's capacity to decode nuanced facial expressions with astonishing precision. While the application of FACS to interpret student emotions within the classroom might strike some as invasive or superfluous, I contend that this technology offers invaluable pedagogical insights with the potential to enrich the educational landscape.\n\nA particularly compelling rationale for integrating FACS into classrooms lies in its promise to bolster student engagement and overall well-being.  By accurately discerning subtle emotional cues like bewilderment, frustration, or ennui, educators can adapt their instructional strategies to more effectively address individual learning needs.

This individualized pedagogical approach can cultivate a more empathetic classroom milieu where students feel genuinely understood and appreciated.\n\nFurthermore, employing FACS in educational settings could prove especially advantageous for students with special needs or those who encounter challenges with verbal expression.  For individuals who find it difficult to articulate their emotions verbally or even through typical non-verbal cues, this technology could function as a crucial tool, enabling educators to gain deeper insights into their affective experiences.",
        "In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is introduced as a potentially revolutionary approach for educators aiming to better understand the dynamics of student engagement and emotional states within the classroom environment. FACS functions by closely examining the minute contractions and relaxations of facial muscles. These seemingly insignificant movements are, in fact, a rich source of information about what students are thinking and feeling during a lesson.\n\nThe data gleaned from FACS can be a game-changer for teachers. It can be extremely difficult to gauge the emotional and cognitive states of every student in a traditional classroom setting, especially in large classes. With FACS, teachers are provided with real-time insights. For example, if a student's facial muscles indicate signs of frustration, such as a furrowed brow or tightened lips, the teacher can modify the teaching method immediately. This could involve slowing down the pace of instruction, re-explaining a difficult concept, or providing additional examples. If a student shows signs of boredom, like a slack jaw or wandering eyes, the teacher might introduce an interactive element to reignite their interest.",

        "Engaging with the formidable task of unraveling Venus\u2019s mysteries entails confronting hazards like oppressive gravity, unbearable temperature extremes, and crushing air pressure. As illustrated in paragraph 5, the author draws a vivid picture of a space rover's potential experience hovering above Venus\u2019s surface. The text elaborates that \"Just as jet airliners ascend to higher altitudes to sidestep turbulent storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would bypass the planet's inhospitable ground conditions by remaining aloft.\" Essentially, this implies that maintaining stability on the ground proves quite challenging for any exploratory apparatus. When it comes to temperature\u2014as noted in paragraph 5\u2014the conditions are described as \"around 170 degrees Fahrenheit,\" painting a portrait of blistering heat. Regarding air pressure, it's yet another daunting factor; endurance only stretches so far before there's an absolute necessity to retreat back towards safety at sea level\u2014a point emphatically reiterated in paragraph 5.\n\nI find myself siding with the author when he asserts that such extreme environments pose significant challenges yet remain survivable for humans: \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" This notion resonates particularly well when one draws parallels with cinematic portrayals where astronauts grapple with survival on planets fraught with harsh environments. Thus arises an understanding of where the author perceives feasibility\u2014should Earth indeed face demise\u2014suggesting relocation to Venus might not be beyond our grasp.",

        "Here's my rewrite, maintaining the informal, conversational style while improving clarity and structure:\n\nI'm totally convinced that driverless cars are the way to go because they're basically like having a super-smart safety guard on the road. Think about it - these cars can stop accidents before they even happen, which means no more deaths from people texting while driving or those terrible hit-and-runs. It's all about keeping everyone safe - both the person in the car and everybody else on the road.\n\nThese cars are packed with amazing tech, like sensors that know when you're getting too close to something and can react way before any crash could happen. They've got this cool thing called LIDAR that shoots out laser beams to create this constantly updating 3-D picture of everything around the car - it's like giving the car human-level awareness, but maybe even better! And thanks to Google's help, these cars can hook right up to Google Maps and figure out exactly where they need to go.\n\nThe safety features are seriously impressive. You've got antilock brakes that kick in automatically when something's in the way or coming at you fast. GM's even created this neat thing where your seat vibrates to warn you about danger or when you're backing up too close to something. And get this - if the car runs into a situation it can't handle, it actually tells you to take over and suggests different routes. They've even put cameras inside to keep an eye on the driver while the car keeps an eye on the road - it's like having a buddy system for safety!\n\nCar companies are going all-in on making driving safer and more fun with these technologies. They're not stopping here either - they keep making improvements to today's cars and have big plans for the future.",
        "There is minimal evidence to prove that emotionally responsive classrooms fueled by FACS are actually beneficial to students. However, there is evidence to back up the claim that FACS is fraught with ethical pitfalls and practical limitations.  Systems relying on such reductive interpretations of human behavior exist, and studies, like those detailed in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" have shown the potential for misinterpretation and bias.\n\nOne reason we know FACS is unlikely to be a positive force in education is because of its similarities to other surveillance systems that erode trust. FACS is the classroom equivalent of invasive monitoring systems common in other sensitive environments, raising immediate privacy concerns.  Educational experts, commenting on these similarities, have expressed concerns about the chilling effect of constant surveillance. \"It reminds me most of panoptic surveillance systems...That's a system that creates an environment of distrust and undermines crucial interpersonal relationships.\" The fact that FACS resembles intrusive systems in other contexts supports the idea of FACS also being detrimental to the learning environment.\n\nNot only does FACS have similarities to harmful surveillance practices, higher quality studies of its inherent limitations have been published since its inception.  Researchers examining FACS have \u201csnapped a picture,\u201d metaphorically speaking, of the system's inability to accurately capture the nuances of human emotion. These studies, readily available, reveal the flaws in reducing complex emotions to simple muscle movements. \"There was no magical solution to understanding student needs after all.\"\n\nSome proponents, however, were not convinced. \"Perhaps,\" said tech enthusiasts, \"the true benefits of FACS are hidden by current limitations.\"  People believed that further advancements would unlock the \u201ctrue potential\u201d of emotional recognition technology. In recent years, on a \"proverbial cloudless day\" of technological optimism, further research got another look. These studies, conducted with increasingly sophisticated algorithms, revealed the persistent limitations of the technology. \"Each pixel in these new studies, metaphorically speaking, still spans a vast chasm of human experience, compared to the grainy picture painted by initial optimistic projections.\"\n\nSimilarities to harmful surveillance systems and high-quality studies of its inherent limitations can support the claim that FACS is not a beneficial tool for classrooms. FACS is simply a flawed system, not a revolutionary educational breakthrough.",
        "According to \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) presents fascinating opportunities for computer analysis of human emotions. FACS is able to recognize and classify conveyed emotions by identifying minute facial muscle movements. Although this technology has potential applications in many different industries, there are serious ethical and practical issues with its use in schools to interpret pupils' emotional expressions. A computerized system's propensity for misunderstandings and biased responses overcomes any apparent educational benefits. \n\nProponents may contend that FACS could assist educators in assessing student involvement and adjusting their lesson plans accordingly. Emotions, however, are complicated and impacted by a number of variables outside the purview of FACS. \nInstead of a lack of understanding, a student's seeming ennui may be caused by exhaustion, personal problems, or just a different learning style. Using FACS runs the danger of misdiagnosing these subtleties, which could result in unfair student labeling and incorrect interventions. Additionally, ongoing observation and emotional analysis can stifle debate in the classroom by preventing critical thinking and free speech. \n\nIn the end, there are significant concerns around student privacy and agency when FACS is used in classrooms. The bond between teachers and students is weakened and an atmosphere of mistrust is created when pupils are subjected to constant emotional monitoring.

        "The \"Face on Mars\" is a fascinating example of how human perception can sometimes create patterns where none exist. Initially, when the Viking 1 orbiter captured the image in 1976, the formation did indeed appear to resemble a human face. However, this was due to the play of light and shadows on the Martian surface, a psychological effect known as pareidolia, where the mind interprets random shapes as familiar objects, such as faces.\n\nLater missions, including those by the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, provided higher-resolution images that dispelled the idea of the \"Face\" being an artificial structure. The clearer images showed that what had appeared to be facial features were simply natural formations, likely eroded mesas or buttes, shaped over millions of years by wind and other environmental forces.\n\nThus, while the \"Face on Mars\" remains a topic of intrigue, scientific analysis confirms that it is a naturally occurring landform, not the product of extraterrestrial engineering. It's a reminder of how science and improved technology allow us to better understand and demystify natural phenomena, steering us away from fanciful interpretations and toward exploration grounded in evidence.",

        "Here's an enriched version that maintains the scientific integrity while employing more sophisticated language and varied structures:\n\nIn the annals of space exploration, few astronomical features have captured humanity's collective imagination quite like the celebrated \"Face on Mars.\" As a NASA scientist, I find myself compelled to unravel the tapestry of misconceptions surrounding this captivating formation. While some enthusiasts champion the hypothesis of extraterrestrial architecture, the weight of scientific evidence points decisively toward natural geological processes.\n\nThe narrative began in 1976 when Viking 1's cameras first glimpsed this beguiling formation in Mars's Cydonia region, unleashing a torrent of speculation and fantastical theories. Yet, as our technological capabilities have evolved, subsequent missions have systematically dismantled these otherworldly interpretations with crystalline clarity.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling testament to the formation's terrestrial origins emerges from the exquisite detail captured by advanced spacecraft like the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

        "In the article \"Driverless Cars are Coming,\" the author delves into the transformative potential of emerging technologies within the automotive sector. While some herald driverless vehicles as a groundbreaking advancement that enhances both safety and convenience, I harbor reservations about their development due to ethical quandaries and privacy concerns.\n\nOn one hand, advocates assert that autonomous technology could dramatically diminish traffic accidents caused by human error. The article references studies underscoring the precision of sensors and the ability of self-driving cars to respond more swiftly than human drivers, potentially saving countless lives on our roads. Moreover, it emphasizes how the ease of multitasking or unwinding during commutes stands out as a compelling feature for these futuristic vehicles.\n\nConversely, my apprehensions regarding the widespread adoption of driverless cars arise from ethical challenges tied to programming them for life-or-death decisions in critical situations. The article highlights scenarios where algorithms might prioritize passenger safety over that of other road users, sparking moral debates about how different lives are valued under such circumstances. Furthermore, issues surrounding data collection and possible abuse via GPS tracking and connectivity features present significant privacy threats that demand serious consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, although autonomous vehicles promise enticing advantages in terms of safety and efficiency, their evolution requires careful deliberation.

On the one hand, advocates argue that FACS might personalize learning and offer insightful feedback to teachers. On the flip side, similar to those dubious alien hypotheses, significant privacy concerns loom large alongside fears of misinterpretation. As described in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" FACS can detect minute muscle movements linked to particular emotions. In theory within classrooms, this capability could signal to educators when students are struggling with lessons or disengaged from the content, allowing educators to tailor interventions accordingly.\n\nHowever, just as natural formations on Mars have been confused with alien artistry due to misleading perspectives; the idea of perpetual emotional monitoring brings forth a chilling ambiance\u2014stifling authentic emotional freedom and instilling unease among pupils.\n\nAdding another layer of complexity are FACS's intrinsic limitations which echo how cultural and individual nuances shape emotions; a student's frown might not merely signal misunderstanding but thoughtful concentration instead\u2014a parallel seen when rock formations were mistaken for artificial constructs until more earthly explanations surfaced.\n\nEthical implications surrounding student emotional data collection further exacerbate concerns akin to misjudging extraterrestrial interventions on Martian landscapes: Who handles such sensitive information?

        "As a NASA scientist, I have met many people who think that\u2002the Face on Mars was an artificially constructed monument built by aliens. I strongly disagree with this\u2002premise after analyzing the evidence and research referred to in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars. I believe that the Face is just a natural landform that has been misidentified\u2002as an artificial construct.\n\nA key argument made by supporters of the alien theory is that the Face is far too\u2002symmetric and organized to be the result of natural processes alone. But as the article points out, this symmetry results from the manner in which\u2002our brains interpret visual data. We humans tend to ask for patterns, and that presents us with paying attention to certain shapes\u2002and structures regardless of its existence. Moreover, detailed images of the Face show a number of geological features like mesas, craters, and valleys that are consistent with the processes of natural\u2002formation.\n\nIts case rests in part on photos taken by\u2002NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which from 1999 to 2006 snapped a series of detailed pictures of the Face from several perspectives and under varying lighting conditions. These images show that the Face changes dramatically\u2002in profile, which should also cast doubt on its natural appearance. Alas, geological investigations indicate that the region containing the Face has been carved out by millions\u2002of years of erosion and weathering, effectively obliterating any artificial structure.\n\nAfter all is said and done though\u2002I remain convinced that the \"Face on Mars\" look more like does have any one any such figure particularly before the mound formed on Mars, therefore until someone comes up with more solid evidence supporting the theory it's best just let Mars itself speak instead. In comparison, a great deal of these geological surveys and fierce-loss evidence of NASA itself, we've must've deduced that each of these formations are indeed originally just that \u2014 deeply sea formations rather than celestial body series of extractions, simply arriving here on the map of natural formations only naturally to later evolve due to\u2002forces here (Many \"weird formation\" shapes were faked for extra suspicion via nilly-naturally evolving in interoperatory causes also when decaying relative to their heights, etc, etc.)",
        "Here's an enriched version that maintains the scientific integrity while employing more sophisticated language and varied structures:\n\nIn the realm of astronomical enigmas, the celebrated \"Face on Mars\" demands rigorous scientific scrutiny rather than speculative interpretation. While popular imagination has long attributed this formation to extraterrestrial architects, the comprehensive analysis presented in 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' yields a far more terrestrial conclusion. As a NASA scientist tasked with illuminating such phenomena, I find myself compelled to dispel the mythological shroud surrounding this geological curiosity, armed with empirical evidence that points decisively toward natural origins.\n\nThe geological argument gains particular potency when we consider Earth's analogous formations. Through the lens of pareidolia\u2014our mind's tendency to impose familiar patterns upon random stimuli\u2014we begin to understand how erosional forces craft seemingly deliberate visages in stone. This cognitive phenomenon, far from unique to Martian observations, manifests regularly in terrestrial landscapes, offering a compelling framework through which to interpret the Face on Mars as nature's handiwork rather than alien artifice.\n\nNASA's sophisticated orbital reconnaissance has yielded unprecedented insights that further dissolve the extraterrestrial hypothesis. High-resolution imagery reveals telltale signatures of natural weathering: stratified geological formations and erosion patterns that bear witness to millions of years of wind and water sculpting the Martian surface. These meticulous observations paint a portrait not of intelligent design, but of time's patient artistry, working through fundamental geological processes to create what merely resembles a face to our pattern-seeking minds.\n\nThe contextual setting of this formation within Cydonia's diverse topographical tapestry provides yet another layer of verification for its natural origins. This region, a veritable museum of geological processes, showcases numerous formations that mirror the erosional characteristics observed in the Face. When viewed within this broader geological canvas, the formation emerges not as an anomaly requiring extraordinary explanation, but as one component in Mars's rich geological narrative.\n\nThe weight of evidence presented in 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' constructs an irrefutable case for natural origins, demonstrating how geological forces, rather than extraterrestrial intelligence, shaped this captivating feature. Through methodical scientific investigation\u2014encompassing pareidolia, geological processes, and contextual analysis\u2014we can appreciate this formation for what it truly represents: a testament to Mars's dynamic geological history. In our quest to understand the cosmos, we must remain anchored to empirical evidence and rational analysis, even when confronted with phenomena that seem to suggest more exotic explanations.",

If someone was traveling on the ocean in that ship, and the rudder stopped working then they would have to, like, take over, and steer themselves.

        "Fed by public\u2002speculation of its artificial origins, the baffling \"Face on Mars\" has enraptured public imagination since its discovery in 1976. But based on my own experience as a NASA scientist who has helped develop\u2002a Martian geological description for six years, I am confident that the Face is just a natural landform resulting from millions of years of Martian weathering and geological processes. Despite the way those early\u2002low-res Viking 1 pictures appeared to display some facial features, sharper imaging rather more conclusively confirmed the natural origins of the landmark.\n\nNASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions provide the best evidence by acquiring detailed images of the feature from different angles\u2002and lighting conditions. Those photos from above showed that\u2002the Face is really an eroded mesa, a form of geological feature common in the Martian Cydonia region of the planet. Unlike facial features displayed in the original Viking image, which looked symmetrical was simply an illusion produced by a blend\u2002of low image resolution, certain lighting conditions and our inclination to assign meaning to random patterns \u2013 also referred to as pareidolia, which causes us to see and recognize the pattern of faces in random shapes.\n\nAnalysis of the region by geological experts lends further support to the explanation that the holes were made\u2002by natural formation. The Face is surrounded\u2002by many other similar mesas and buttes formed by the same processes of weathering and erosion. Such formations\u2002have similar geological features, including layered sedimentary rocks and wind-carved features. The dimension and position of the Face are identical to other nearby natural formations, which suggests that they were all created by the same regional geology and not by\u2002artificial organization.\n\nThose alleged facial features which\u2002appeared so convincing can easily be attributed to natural processes. Now researchers say these features, described in low-resolution images as \u201ceyes\u201d and a \u201cmouth,\u201d\u2002are depressions filled with shadow as sand eroded through the fine sands and dust by wind, while the \u201cnose\u201d is a ridge of more resistant layers of rock that survived erosion better than the surrounding material. These features can resemble faces, however, at\u2002different angles or under different lighting conditions, they lose this face-like appearance altogether, spot lighting their true geological nature.",
        "The unveiling of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as explained in the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" introduces an extraordinary blend between innovation and our innate emotional expressions. This system, which empowers computers to decode complex human emotions through subtle facial signals, holds profound potential for numerous domains, not least of all education. Some may argue against its necessity or perceive it as intrusive within educational settings; however, its application can significantly enrich both teaching and learning experiences. By discerning students' emotions with precision, educators have the capacity to tailor their instructional methods to create enriching and supportive academic atmospheres.\n\nOne striking benefit of deploying FACS in educational spaces lies in its capacity to yield real-time feedback regarding students\u2019 emotional engagement. Educators quite often grapple with determining if their teaching strikes a chord with each learner. By interpreting nuanced facial indicators like knitted brows or smiles through FACS, teachers glean insights into which elements of their lesson ignite interest or spark confusion. For example, should a particular component repeatedly evoke feelings of frustration or boredom among several pupils, instructors can swiftly modify their approaches\u2014perhaps by integrating interactive elements\u2014to rekindle student enthusiasm and elucidate challenging concepts.\n\nMoreover, this innovative technology bolsters personalized learning by bringing to light individual emotional reactions that might otherwise go unnoticed due to limitations imposed by class size. In larger classroom environments where personal interactions may be constrained by time or high student-to-teacher ratios, FACS emerges as a valuable tool enabling educators to better comprehend each learner's unique educational trajectory. Identifying when a student experiences overwhelm versus focused contentment empowers teachers to provide timely assistance fine-tuned precisely for that individual\u2019s needs\u2014whether supplying more stimulating material for those facing ennui or extra help for those grappling with comprehension challenges.",

This revolutionary system stands poised to transform educational landscapes by offering educators unprecedented access to their students' emotional wavelengths in real time. When instructors can instantly recognize signs of bewilderment or distress, they can pivot their pedagogical approach with precision, crafting a more responsive and nurturing learning environment. Such personalized attention often catalyzes heightened engagement and knowledge retention, as learners who feel genuinely understood tend to immerse themselves more deeply in the educational process.\n\nThe implications of FACS extend far beyond mere academic optimization. This sophisticated emotional surveillance system could serve as a sentinel, alerting educators to subtle psychological disturbances that might otherwise go undetected. In an era where students navigate an increasingly complex maze of social and academic pressures, this early-warning capability proves invaluable. By identifying nascent emotional challenges through microscopic facial cues, educators can orchestrate interventions before minor concerns escalate into major crises. This proactive stance on emotional well-being helps cultivate an educational ecosystem where psychological health commands as much attention as scholarly achievement.\n\nNevertheless, the prospect of implementing FACS technology in educational settings raises compelling ethical questions, particularly regarding privacy and personal autonomy. Critics rightfully question the implications of constant emotional surveillance, suggesting it might encroach upon students' fundamental right to emotional privacy. To navigate these murky waters, institutions must craft robust frameworks that govern the deployment of such technology, ensuring transparent communication and obtaining informed consent from all stakeholders.",
        "Where others are indeed fooling themselves, and should their positionality allow, take a moment to reflect on the\u2002potential of such endeavors \u2014 of driverless cars as they have existed: the dev/proxies of their world: that new: of up to take to. While I do see and understand the points the article \u201cDriverless Cars are Coming\u201d made, I really think that the evolution of cars should be\u2002a better thing. As one potential example, the article states that driverless cars can significantly decrease the probability of accidents occurring when they incorporate sophisticated\u2002sensors and cameras, enabling them to perceive and react to their environment much faster and more precisely than human operators.\n\nAnother\u2002major argument, raised by people opposed to driverless cars, is that they are unable to make split-second decisions in emergency situations. But as the article states, tests show that automated vehicles are capable of appropriately reacting in these scenarios, even avoiding accidents that potentially could have\u2002happened during human operation. Driverless cars also have potential to\u2002reduce traffic congestion by optimizing routes and speed to cut down travel time. Another major effect of this automation would\u2002be the effect of providing independence to those that may not be able to drive themselves, like elderly or people with disabilities.\n\nFinally, my view is that, while there are some genuine problems when it comes to building self-moving cars, the benefit they bring to society heavily\u2002outweighs the downside of them. That alone makes them an appealing alternative for\u2002a number of commuters. With their ongoing advancements, we can expect things to get better and better, and all remaining issues to be perfected and\u2002solved in the long run. Instead of stalling their development, we should be embracing this innovative\u2002tech and promoting its deployment on our roads. So we can build a safer, more effective transportation system for\u2002all. In my opinion, autonomous vehicles has the potential to positively impact ways\u2002that are liked by the majority of the population.",
        "The evolution of autonomous vehicles represents an unavoidable stride in technology, promising a host of advantages that render them a pursuit worth undertaking. As detailed in the article \"Driverless Cars are Coming,\" these cutting-edge vehicles hold the potential to transform transportation by significantly boosting both safety and efficiency. The central argument supporting driverless cars lies in their capacity to minimize human error, which is responsible for the majority of traffic accidents. The article underscores that armed with advanced sensors and algorithms, these vehicles can identify and respond to potential dangers with greater speed and precision than human drivers.\n\nFurthermore, autonomous cars could dramatically enhance traffic flow and alleviate congestion since they have the capability to communicate instantly with one another, optimizing routes to sidestep bottlenecks. This not only saves time but also curtails fuel consumption and emissions, thus promoting environmental sustainability. Nonetheless, it is crucial to recognize concerns such as job displacement for professional drivers and vulnerabilities like system failures or cyber-attacks. Despite these challenges, robust regulatory frameworks coupled with ongoing technological advancements can effectively mitigate such risks.\n\nIn summary, while there are legitimate apprehensions regarding the deployment of driverless cars, their prospective advantages concerning safety improvements, heightened efficiency, and positive environmental impacts considerably outweigh any disadvantages.

        "In the discussion of the so-called \"Face on Mars,\" it is important to have a scientific perspective that is based on factual data rather than conjecture. Many individuals think that the Face, which NASA's Viking 1 satellite took the first pictures of in 1976, is a man-made structure made by a highly developed extraterrestrial culture. But I can say with confidence as a NASA scientist that this interpretation is wrong and that the Face is just a natural landform. \n\nThis argument's main premise is that high-resolution photos from later missions have shown the Face to be nothing more than a lighting and shadow-induced optical illusion. \n'Unmasking the Face on Mars' presents strong evidence from these missions, especially from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS). Images of Cydonia Mensae taken by this spacecraft at various angles and times of day demonstrate how variations in sunlight may significantly influence how surface features appear. For example, higher-resolution MGS pictures from 1998 showed unequivocally that what looked like facial characteristics were instead random geological formations such as buttes and mesas. Moreover, MRO's use of stereo imaging techniques verified that no symmetrical or precisely geometric structures suggestive of intelligent design are present.\n\nIn conclusion, current scientific data unequivocally shows that the Face on Mars is just a product of natural processes, even while it makes sense why some people could interpret early images of the Face as proof of extraterrestrial activity. There is little reason to question its actual status as a geological feature formed over millions of years by wind erosion and other planetary forces, given the comprehensive imaging and analysis supplied by sophisticated Martian orbiters.

Yet, as an adept NASA researcher engrossed in scrutinizing this enigma, I confidently affirm that the countenance is no more than a product of natural geological metamorphosis molded by Martian climatic forces over eons.\n\nThe quintessence of this contention stems from meticulous scrutiny of high-definition imagery captured by the Mars Global Surveyor in 2001, effectively dismantling the alien-fabrication conjecture. These intricate snapshots unveiled that the semblance of symmetry constituting the \"face\" in antiquated Viking depictions was merely a mirage concocted by low-res imaging quirks, shadows cast askance, and our innate inclination to discern order amidst chaos. The fresh visuals distinctly showcase an irregular mesa characteristic of Cydonia's terrain, etched with organic erosion patterns sculpted by gusts of wind, veils of dust stirred by storms, and vestiges of erstwhile aqueous endeavors. Moreover, both proportions and constitution align seamlessly with other indigenous geologic formations strewn across Mars's expanse.\n\nDiving deeper into geological assessments within said locale furnishes added substantiation regarding the Face's genesis. Its framework is comprised of identical sedimentary bedrocks ubiquitous throughout these precincts while its weathering echoes that witnessed on juxtaposed mesas in close proximity.

        "The\u2002idea that the Face on Mars was built by aliens is a fascinating but incorrect reading of a natural phenomenon. When the Viking\u20021 orbiter first took photos of this formation in 1976, the combination of a low-resolution photograph and a certain angle of sunlight played a trick on observers' eyes, giving it a facial appearance that sparked speculation about whether it was artificial in origin. At the same time, more\u2002recent high-resolution images from contemporary spacecraft have conclusively established the true nature of this Martian landform.\n\nScience today shows that the Face is nothing more than a natural mesa carved by millions of years\u2002of geological processes on Mars. The most detailed photographs from the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001 show that the \u201cface\u201d disappears with different angles of view and\u2002higher resolution.

The article itself highlights the complexity of interpreting facial gestures, even for trained human observers. Cultural diversity, variation in individual expressiveness, and the multifaceted nature of emotions make directly linking facial muscle motions to underlying emotional states difficult. A pupil frowning could be struggling with the material but just as easily contemplating a personal matter, feeling unwell, or intensely concentrating. Relying on a computer program to interpret such nuances risks misdiagnosis and potentially inappropriate interventions. A teacher, alerted to a pupil's perceived boredom through FACS, could single them out for attention, generating embarrassment and exacerbating any underlying anxieties. Furthermore, the continuous surveillance implied by FACS could cultivate a climate of self-consciousness, discouraging pupils from expressing authentic reactions and inhibiting the free exchange of ideas essential for active learning.\n\nBeyond potential for misinterpretation, employing FACS in classrooms raises serious ethical concerns regarding pupil privacy and autonomy. Students deserve environments where they can learn and develop without constant scrutiny of emotion-detecting software. The very act of being monitored can alter behavior and inhibit natural expression, generating a chilling effect on classroom dynamics.

        "The \"Face on Mars\" has long captivated the public imagination, fueling speculation about extraterrestrial civilizations.  However, a scientifically grounded perspective, essential for any NASA researcher like myself, demands an evidence-based approach.  A compelling body of data and analyses strongly suggests that this Martian feature is a natural landform, sculpted by geological forces rather than alien design.  A critical examination of the available evidence reveals that terrestrial processes, not otherworldly architects, are responsible for this intriguing formation.\n\nChief among the arguments for the Face's natural origin is its conformity to established principles of geological development.  Satellite imagery reveals that this formation, nestled in Mars' Cydonia region, bears a striking resemblance to terrestrial mesas, forged by the relentless forces of erosion and sedimentation.  Experts point out that the facial illusion, initially captured by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976, was significantly enhanced by the interplay of light and shadow.  Subsequent overhead perspectives, offering a clearer view, dispel the illusion, demonstrating how imaginative patterns can emerge from particular angles and lighting conditions, rather than representing deliberate extraterrestrial construction.\n\nFurthermore, more recent high-resolution images acquired by missions like the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter provide powerful counter-evidence to the alien hypothesis. These surveys, boasting superior accuracy and detail, expose the Face's asymmetrical, jagged topography, highlighting irregularities consistent with natural wind erosion patterns on Mars.  This comprehensive imagery offers irrefutable clarity, depicting a landscape shaped over eons by the erosive forces of Martian weather, rather than any artificial intervention.\n\nIn summary, while the Face's initial appearance may ignite the imagination, rigorous scientific scrutiny, based on objective analysis and impartial evaluation, definitively classifies it as a natural phenomenon.  Geological processes capable of producing such seemingly enigmatic formations are well-documented on both Earth and Mars.  Ongoing exploration and advancements in space technology continue to demystify the Red Planet, reaffirming that, while the universe undoubtedly harbors countless mysteries, scientific evidence suggests that conventional geological forces are the true sculptors of this evocative Martian landmark.",

        "The enigmatic \"Face on Mars\" has stirred the collective imagination, giving rise to speculations of ancient extraterrestrial civilizations. Nevertheless, compelling scientific data squarely indicates that this peculiar formation is a product of natural geology rather than an extraterrestrial edifice. The initial grainy snapshots captured by the Viking orbiter back in 1976 inadvertently created an optical illusion, conjuring up features reminiscent of eyes, a nose, and a mouth through the interplay of light and shadow. This phenomenon known as pareidolia\u2014wherein the mind finds coherent patterns in random stimuli\u2014stands as a well-documented quirk in human psychology. To deepen our comprehension of this mysterious structure's genesis, further meticulous examination remains imperative.\n\nSubsequent to these early portrayals, advanced imagery from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft furnished by high-caliber cameras uncovered a drastically eroded mesa that bore little resemblance to its erstwhile face-like semblance. The detailed MGS pictures unequivocally portrayed the entity as a naturally occurring rock configuration harmonizing with its Martian milieu.",

        "Driverless cars have good points and bad points, but I don't think they should be on our streets. They're too much for people to handle.  I don't think they'll ever really be on the street because they're so dangerous.  Lots of states have already banned testing them. I agree with those states because driverless cars are dangerous, they'll make people even lazier than they already are, and lots of people probably couldn't afford them.\n\nDriverless cars are dangerous because a computer controls everything; the passenger isn't in control all the time.  Traffic laws say a safe car has a human driver in control at all times. If a passenger is in a driverless car, and it starts messing up and the passenger gets hurt or even dies, whose fault is it? The passenger's or the manufacturer's?\n\nDriverless cars just make things way more complicated. I think most people... it just makes people lazier and lazier.  I think there are some things people should always do themselves, and driving is one of them.\n\nRegular cars are already expensive enough. I can only imagine how much driverless cars will cost.  Even if they were on the streets, who could really buy them?  Not many people. Only rich people would buy them. So, wasting all this money making driverless cars is pointless if most people can't buy them.\n\nDriverless cars won't be good for this country. They'll just make things worse and put people in danger. States are banning these cars for a reason. I think more states should, too; it's the right thing to do.

        "The article \u2018Unmasking the Face on Mars\u2019 delivers scientific proofs which refute the idea that the Face comes from ancient Martian or extraterrestrial intelligence. At NASA, I have the privilege of interacting with people daily who have different assumptions about Mars' secrets. The idea of the Face as a natural feature developed by erosion is backed fully by the specific examples and proof provided in the article.  The second key claim that supports the natural formation theory is that the so-called Face on Mars has a strong resemblance to other geological structures on the planet, including sand dunes and mesas. Over countless years, erosion and wind have formed complex land features that can mimic recognizable shapes, as the article explains with detailed examples. Detailed satellite image analysis shows similar patterns and structures throughout different parts of the Martian landscape, which supports this claim.  High-resolution pictures also demonstrate there are no artificial features in the Face region that would suggest its creation by humans. Human-made structures lack both symmetry and engineering elements found in natural features which supports the view that this landform also originated naturally. The Face on Mars, no matter how much it looks like an ancient structure, highlights natural forces rather than being a sign of an alien artifact.",

        "Discovered in 1976, the \u201cFace on Mars\u201d predates Google Earth and has ignited the\u2002public imagination for decades over the possibility of aliens and ancient civilizations. As a NASA scientist, I understand the appeal of this idea, but\u2002the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that there is no alien monument of this kind, just a natural geological formation. Blurry photographs taken by the Viking orbiter in 1976 gave the impression it had eyes, a nose and a\u2002mouth, and some thought it was a face intentionally built. However, subsequent high-resolution images\u2002captured by the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have refuted this misconception.\n\nLocated in a region of\u2002Mars known as Cydonia, the \u201cFace\u201d is surrounded with mesas and eroded hills. What looked like faces are just shadows and highlights\u2002playing on a mundane outcrop. Later images, shot with better cameras in varied light, show a far\u2002more eroded and decidedly less face-like structure. The symmetry and uniformity observed in Viking's images are now understood to be an\u2002effect of the low resolution of the camera and the geometry of sunlight when the images were taken. The newer versions revealed the Cydonia \u201cFace\u201d to actually be a\u2002typical Martian mesa just like thousands of similar areas scattered across Cydonia.\n\nSo, the \"Face on Mars\" can be seen as a cautionary tale about the power of pareidolia to impose on us an image of ourselves when\u2002we are measuring random data. Though the first images raised tantalizing speculation, better science and\u2002better imaging have by now given a more realistic and much less sensational answer. In\u2002short, the Face is not an ancient Martian artifact; it is the telling of the power of natural geology to produce curious but ultimately natural formations.",

Although the idea of integrating FACS into classrooms holds great appeal, a closer examination reveals that its ethical ramifications and practical constraints cast serious doubts on its actual worth.\n\nAdvocates of FACS in education paint a picture of a classroom where teachers can instantly assess student involvement and understanding simply via analyzing their facial expressions. Picture a scenario where a teacher can accurately determine when a student is perplexed, disinterested or motivated. This real-time feedback would enable teachers to modify their teaching approaches promptly and offer additional assistance to students who are struggling and presenting more challenges to those who are performing well. The article emphasizes FACS's capacity to distinguish between subtle emotional differences, and this implies an ability to gain insights that even the most vigilant human observer might miss. In theory, such detailed emotional data could lead to highly individualized learning experiences and enable students to reach their full potential. Nevertheless, this rosy view fails to take into account the substantial limitations and potential harm associated with using FACS in classrooms. Individualized learning is indeed captivating as it\u2019s customized according to each student's emotional reactions. However, given the present technological capabilities, its deployment in the highly sensitive educational environment is not yet justifiable.\n\nFirst of all, the reliability of FACS in deciphering complex emotional states is still in question. The article mainly focuses on identifying basic emotions, yet human emotions are far more intricate in reality. For example, a wrinkled forehead could indicate deep thought, confusion or irritation. Similarly, a smile might represent true comprehension, forced courtesy or even nervousness. Relying on FACS to interpret these expressions runs the risk of misinterpreting students' emotions, which could then result in the application of inappropriate teaching methods. Moreover, the classroom environment is filled with various factors that could disrupt the accurate analysis of facial expressions such as lighting conditions, the seating arrangement of students and even individual facial characteristics. All these can affect the software's performance and result in inaccurate readings potentially.",

However, despite these potential advantages, I argue that the development and deployment of driverless cars should proceed cautiously due to the serious challenges they pose, including widespread job displacement, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and complex ethical dilemmas.\n\nOne of the most pressing concerns about driverless cars is their potential to displace millions of workers. As noted in the article, jobs in industries such as taxi services and truck driving are particularly vulnerable to automation. The loss of these roles could trigger economic instability, leaving countless individuals without a means of livelihood and causing ripple effects throughout affected communities. In addition to the economic impact, cybersecurity presents another significant challenge. Driverless vehicles depend on sophisticated software systems that are susceptible to hacking or system malfunctions. A cyberattack on these systems could result in catastrophic consequences, from vehicles being taken over by bad actors to large-scale disruptions of traffic and safety. Moreover, the ethical dilemmas associated with autonomous vehicles demand serious consideration. The article highlights the \"trolley problem,\" where self-driving cars may face situations requiring them to make life-or-death decisions. The responsibility for programming such moral choices into machines raises critical questions about accountability and the ethical framework guiding these technologies.\n\nUltimately, while driverless cars hold the promise of reducing traffic accidents and enhancing convenience, the risks they pose are too significant to ignore. The potential for large-scale job losses, heightened cybersecurity threats, and unresolved moral challenges underscores the need for a cautious and measured approach. Policymakers and developers must collaborate to address these concerns, ensuring that the societal impact of autonomous vehicles is carefully managed.",
        "Driverless cars have been a hotly contested topic these past few years, as proponents emphasize their promising prospects while others air valid worries about sociocultural impacts. In the article \"Autonomous Vehicles are Imminent,\" the author discusses both encouraging and troubling facets of this automation, shedding light on diverse dimensions of the advancing tech. Upon thoroughly assessing arguments presented, I remain firmly against developing driverless cars owing to still unsolved protection quandaries and moral dilemmas affiliated with use.\n\nA persuasive point raised underscores driverless vehicles' future to potentially alleviate congestion and enhance transportation proficiency at large. Yet this raises questions about prioritizing expediency over human aptitude at the controls. Driving has eternally tested one's capacity to handle unpredictable situations on the roadway, guaranteeing collective safety through personal responsibility.\n\nMoreover, according to data cited, accidents involving autonomous autos have spawned serious uncertainties regarding their dependability and applicability in reality. This alarming trend underscores how pivotal human intervention can be in dodging deadly collisions and instantaneously deciding under moral judgment\u2014something machines inherently lack.\n\nDespite claims by advocates that driverless cars may revolutionize transportation through enhancing safety and convenience, it is crucial not to overlook social costs concurrent with increased mechanization. Job losses for professional motorists could lead to widespread unemployment and economic downturns in related industries profoundly reliant on human labor.\n\nIn conclusion, while driverless vehicles may offer certain advantages like bettering traffic flow and decreasing accidents caused by human error, the potential socioethical drawbacks dramatically outweigh these benefits\u2014both concerning still unsolved protection obstacles and the reality that they may supplant human choice, which bots can never genuinely replicate.",
        "While the idea of the Face on Mars being of alien origin is an interesting one, it is not backed up by actual evidence. I have been able to spend a lot of time studying the Face and its surroundings in my position at NASA. I believe that the Face is a completely natural feature of the surface of the planet, formed by the usual processes that occur on the planet.  In the article, \u201cUnmasking the Face on Mars\u201d the evidence to support this idea is provided. It explains that the Face can be seen as part of a larger picture with similar features and patterns all around it. It also points out that the Face looks different in different pictures due to different lighting and viewing angles. This makes it clear that the Face is not a structure built by humans or other intelligent beings, but is rather a natural feature of the geology of Mars.

        "The integration of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) within educational environments brings forth a myriad of promising opportunities and noteworthy concerns regarding the assessment of students and the dynamics within classrooms. While this technological advancement unveils unparalleled insights into student involvement and emotional reactions, its utilization necessitates a thorough evaluation of both its advantages and potential pitfalls.\n\nThe capacity to automatically identify and examine students' facial expressions could equip educators with invaluable real-time feedback on their pedagogical efficacy. As students exhibit signs of bewilderment, tedium, or vexation, teachers can promptly recalibrate their instructional approaches or pacing to better cater to their students' requirements. This innovative tool holds particular promise in expansive classroom settings where individualized monitoring proves arduous, or in virtual learning platforms where conventional visual cues may prove elusive. Moreover, the systematic collation of emotional response data could unearth trends in student engagement across various subjects, teaching methodologies, or temporal contexts\u2014empowering educational institutions to refine their instructional paradigms based on empirical evidence rather than subjective impressions.\n\nNevertheless, the incorporation of FACS into classrooms raises weighty ethical as well as pragmatic dilemmas that warrant attentive consideration. Pupils may experience discomfiture knowing that their facial expressions are under perpetual scrutiny and analysis\u2014a circumstance that could potentially foster a climate of surveillance inhibiting natural comportment and authentic emotional manifestation. There exists also the peril of oversimplification since facial expressions do not invariably mirror a student's genuine emotional disposition or cognitive grasp. Disparities in emotive displays influenced by cultural variances might result in misinterpretations\u2014with students from diverse backgrounds being particularly vulnerable to such biases. Furthermore, reducing intricate human sentiments and scholastic experiences into mere data points might inadvertently promote an excessively mechanistic approach toward education\u2014a development with potential repercussions on eroding the indispensable human connections fundamental to effective teaching-learning dynamics.\n\nWhile FACS technology proffers tantalizing prospects for unraveling the intricacies of student engagement, its deployment should be undertaken judiciously\u2014ensuring it functions as an adjunct amplifying rather than supplanting the quintessential human facets inherent within education.",

Though one might be tempted to envision this geological curiosity as an artifact of some long-vanished extraterrestrial civilization, the empirical evidence presents an incontrovertible case for its natural origins. Advanced imaging technology has peeled back layers of mystery, revealing how millennia of aeolian and fluvial erosion sculpted this remarkable formation. What once appeared as haunting facial features in grainy, low-resolution photographs has been unmasked by modern instrumentation as mere tricks of light and shadow, artifacts of primitive imaging capabilities.\n\n\"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" illuminates how subsequent planetary expeditions, armed with sophisticated photographic equipment, have definitively identified the formation as a mesa\u2014an elevated landform characterized by precipitous flanks and a level summit.",
        "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), explored in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" offers a groundbreaking approach to emotion recognition. By mapping facial muscle movements to specific emotional states, FACS enables computers to interpret human expressions with remarkable precision. This technology has the potential to transform educational environments, allowing teachers to assess student engagement and understanding in real-time. Picture a scenario where a teacher can instantly detect confusion or boredom on a student\u2019s face, enabling them to adjust their teaching methods on the spot. Such personalized responses could enhance learning experiences, fostering a more dynamic and adaptive classroom atmosphere. Additionally, FACS could offer teachers valuable insights into the broader classroom dynamics, helping them identify recurring issues that affect student well-being.\n\nYet, the integration of FACS into classroom settings raises important ethical considerations. For one, students may feel like they are under constant scrutiny, which could hinder their ability to engage authentically in lessons. There is also the issue of FACS\u2019s ability to accurately decode complex emotional expressions. Cultural differences, personal expression variations, and the tendency to mask emotions could all lead to inaccurate readings. Moreover, placing too much trust in technology to measure student comprehension may overshadow other vital forms of communication, such as verbal interaction and body language.",
        "The concept that extraterrestrial beings sculpted the \"Face on Mars\" has stirred imaginations since its discovery by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976. However, as a NASA scientist, it is incumbent upon me to assert that this structure is simply a product of natural processes. The perception of a face in this formation primarily stems from pareidolia, wherein humans perceive recognizable patterns where none exist.\n\nInitial advancements in imaging technology have debunked the notion of alien intervention. The initial image's limited resolution cast shadows and highlights that mimicked facial characteristics. Subsequent missions to Mars, notably those conducted by the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, provided high-resolution images revealing that what seemed like eyes and a mouth were merely fortuitous alignments of ridges and valleys.\n\nFurthermore, analogous formations are found on Earth without necessitating alien origins. Various mountain ranges exhibit intriguing shapes when observed from specific angles but are acknowledged as outcomes of geological phenomena such as erosion and sedimentation over time. This comprehension equally applies to Martian terrain; wind erosion likely molded this mesa into its present semblance.\n\nTo sum up, though some may find solace in the belief of extraterrestrial artisans crafting monuments across galaxies, scientific data points towards a more prosaic rationale for the \"Face on Mars\": it is but an ordinary land structure shaped by standard geological forces. As our exploration expands our understanding of celestial bodies like Mars, these discussions serve as reminders of humanity's proclivity for weaving extraordinary narratives out of commonplace occurrences\u2014a tendency rooted more in creativity than actuality.",
        "The close proximity of Venus to Earth makes her a hard planet to explore because of her harsh environment.  However, it is valid to assert that the study of this hostile planet is a worthwhile endeavor as is stated in the article \u201cThe Challenge of Exploring Venus\u201d.  This claim is backed up effectively by the author through the provision of information on the scientific value and potential benefits of Venusian exploration.  First of all, the author begins with the argument that Venus is geologically similar to Earth and this makes scientists curious as to why the two planets evolved differently.  This comparison is placed there to grab the reader\u2019s attention and to make the reader understand the reason for the exploration.  He also explains that the surface temperature of Venus is as high as 462\u00b0C, the pressure is 92 times that of Earth and the atmosphere is toxic.  This is a real acknowledgement of the risks which makes the attempt to overcome them and achieve a successful Venus mission even more significant.  The author also points out that it is possible to get important information on how Earth\u2019s climate may change in the future by comparing the two planets, especially the gas-filled layers of the atmosphere.  This is an understandable application of the idea and it gives more substance to the argument for exploration.  Also, the possibility of microorganisms living in the atmosphere of Venus raises a very interesting question which makes the exploration more relevant.  The author effectively builds a case for the pursuit of Venus exploration by explaining the special value of new knowledge about planetary evolution, atmospheric processes and the possible existence of extraterrestrial life that the mission could bring.  The author does not hold back from the risks that come with it.  These dangers are shown as challenges that can be overcome and this makes the mission sound like it will be worthwhile.  Therefore, the author effectively argues for further exploration of Venus based on the unique scientific knowledge that awaits probe missions, regardless of the hostile environment.  The possibilities of enhancing the knowledge of Earth and other planets and the search for life elsewhere in the universe are more important than the risks that come with it.",

The Seagoing Cowboys program, which I have experienced, provides an unmatched chance for those who want to experience the excitement of the open sea and make themselves valuable to international relief efforts. This incredible program enabled me to follow my passion for exploring new territories while supporting a noble cause by transporting horses from across the oceans to European regions devastated by World War II.\n\nThe primary reason participants should join is the thrill of exploring the vast oceans while seeing various landscapes for themselves. We passed stunning landscapes during our voyages; we saw dolphins competing with our ship and explored various cultures among others. I gained so much insight into the world that my understanding of global diversity expanded in ways I never thought possible.   Moreover, this noble cause provides an opportunity to feed the mind and the spirit. The journey was unpredictable yet rewarding: taking care of the animals on the boat, building friendships with crew members who shared my challenges during bumpy seas, a powerful story that shows how people find their way to each other through stormy waters when they answer duty\u2019s call to altruism.  The most enjoyable part took place during nautical passages where we engaged in passionate talks about socio-political issues while maps beneath lantern light illuminated our discussions and encouraged thought exchanges that expanded knowledge to boost campaign tenacity which provided sufficient means to supply life-giving renaissance hours to increase caloric ease for strained ground needing renewed horticultural vitality after it lacked sense and comfort-leisure freed people from cruel inflammatory bondage which empires created through prejudice and turbulent fights for dominance that lasted only briefly against authority which now demands modernization along with truthful competency to empower systematic liberation through enlightened patronage which brings joy to everyone everywhere!",
        "The so-called \u201cFace on Mars,\u201d as\u2002photographed by Viking 1 in 1976, triggered a flurry of speculation about aliens. But as a NASA scientist, I can say with certainty that the Face is nothing\u2002but a natural landform, resulting from regular geological processes. The first, low-resolution picture of the mesa that the Viking 1 sent back produced shadows and light patterns that created the\u2002appearance of a human face. This phenomenon, scientifically\u2002called pareidolia, makes people gang up and perceive familiar shapes where none are. Later high-res photos taken from Mars\u2002Global Surveyor and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that such images simply show an area that is rocky with no facial features.\n\nEven more\u2002compelling to our case, multiple scientific studies show that the mesa's surface is comprised of naturally occurring Martian rock shaped by wind erosion over millions of years. These forces, not unlike those shaping Earth\u2019s landscapes, form features frequently\u2002misread from a distance. These high-definition images portray\u2002a naked landscape, sans the fictional \"face\" used as an argument for alien construction, so conclusive here.\" Though imagination fuels myths about its alien origin, the scientific lens reveals what lies beyond in the cosmic shadows, this time confirming\u2002that, for the most part, the Face on Mars is nothing more than a play of light and shadow.",

        "According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a revolutionary technological advancement that can recognize and decipher human emotions from facial expressions. FACS has been suggested for use in educational settings, where it may be able to track pupils' emotional states in real time. Although it's an interesting concept, employing this kind of technology to improve education has serious moral and practical issues. On the one hand, FACS might offer priceless information about the engagement and well-being of students, assisting teachers in customizing their pedagogy to better suit their learners' needs. However, using FACS in the classroom may result in privacy violations, emotional misunderstandings, and a loss of the human connection that is necessary for good teaching and learning. \n\nThe ability of FACS to detect students who are experiencing emotional or academic difficulties is the main justification for its use in schools. Teachers could better comprehend when kids are puzzled, bored, or frustrated by keeping an eye on their facial expressions. For instance, the teacher could offer extra help right away or present the material in a different way if a student continuously shows signs of bewilderment during a given lesson. In the end, better academic results and student happiness may result from more individualized and efficient training brought about by this real-time feedback.\n\nAdditionally, FACS might assist teachers in fostering a more encouraging learning environment. Academic achievement depends heavily on emotional health, and kids are more likely to participate actively in their education when they feel safe and understood. Teachers can prevent problems like anxiety or disengagement by anticipating their pupils' emotional conditions. For example, if a teacher observes through FACS that a student appears nervous during group talks, they might use techniques to help the student feel more at ease, such giving them a less scary role or giving them more praise. \n\nBut there are also serious ethical issues with using FACS in the classroom, especially with regard to privacy. Knowing that their facial expressions are being watched and examined all the time may make students uneasy. The whole goal of employing the technology may be compromised if this causes them to feel invaded and reluctant to communicate their actual emotions. Moreover, the information gathered by FACS may be exploited or treated improperly, which could have unforeseen repercussions. For instance, kids' academic performance and self-esteem may suffer if the data ends up in the wrong hands and is used to stigmatize or unfairly label them. \n\nThe possibility of misunderstanding is another possible problem with FACS. Although FACS relies on an advanced facial coding system, human emotions are complicated and subject to many influences. Not because they are having difficulty with the content, a student may seem disengaged only because they are worn out or distracted by personal matters. Over-reliance on FACS may result in inappropriate treatments and inaccurate conclusions regarding children' learning needs. Teachers are frequently better able to decipher emotional signs in context because they have a more comprehensive understanding of their students.",

Here's my attempt:\n\nThe dangers of regular cars include things such as human error, traffic jams, and pollution. Human error because in many studies they show that people cause most accidents on the road. The text states that \"driverless cars are equipped with advanced sensors and algorithms\" which means they can spot danger better than humans. Basically saying that humans would have a hard time being as safe as computers.\n\nTraffic problems would be another issue because as the article states \"driverless cars could reduce traffic congestion by optimizing traffic flow\". Traffic would be way better controlled. Pollution would be another problem that driverless cars could fix because you can only have so many regular cars before the environment gets too damaged. As the article states again about \"reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants\".\n\nI do agree with the article as it says these cars are \"a positive step forward\". There have been some attempts at making regular cars safer where engineers tried different safety features, but driverless cars take it to the next level. So I do understand where the article is coming from that it could be possible if regular cars become too dangerous and we are stuck to move to driverless ones.\n\nIn conclusion, we are humans, we have been through everything from the invention of the wheel to the creation of smartphones to people getting stuck in traffic every day to Tesla making electric cars. If humans been through all that, I think we can handle switching to driverless cars.\n\n*Note: I've maintained the somewhat informal, stream-of-consciousness style of the reference text, including its occasional grammatical irregularities and repetitive structure, while adapting the content about driverless cars.*",

        "Amidst our escalating global dependence on technology, the emergence of autonomous vehicles has ignited considerable discussion.  The article, \"Driverless Cars are Coming,\" explores the multifaceted implications of this technology, presenting both its merits and its potential pitfalls, ultimately allowing readers to draw their own conclusions.\n\nFrom my perspective, the advent of driverless cars represents a significant stride forward.  As the article elucidates, a primary advantage of these vehicles lies in their capacity to mitigate traffic collisions. Equipped with sophisticated sensors and algorithms, autonomous vehicles possess the ability to perceive and react to dangers with greater speed and precision than human drivers, thereby offering a safer mode of transportation for commuters.\n\nFurthermore, the article underscores the enhanced mobility that self-driving cars could afford the elderly and individuals with disabilities. Liberated from the necessity of a human operator, these populations could experience newfound independence in travel, profoundly enriching their quality of life.  Moreover, autonomous vehicles hold the promise of alleviating traffic congestion by optimizing travel routes and diminishing the sheer volume of cars on roadways.\n\nIn summation, while legitimate anxieties surrounding the development of autonomous vehicles undoubtedly exist, I contend that their advantages eclipse their disadvantages.  Possessing the potential to curtail accidents, empower mobility for vulnerable demographics, and mitigate traffic gridlock, self-driving cars hold the transformative power to revolutionize our transportation infrastructure.",
        "I can't imagine a life, or a point in time, where in the future everyone's driving around in driverless cars. Can you?  I think it's okay if some people, you know, people who need help driving, use them, or maybe own one, but for everyone? I don't exactly see how that makes the world better for everyone. The world evolves with transportation in so many ways already.  Look around! Bike lanes everywhere, people running, walking, jogging, there's Uber, that's huge now.  So, why driverless cars? So people can get even lazier and barely even drive? From the time you're a kid, you're looking forward to driving, that's something me and a lot of others believe shouldn't be taken away.\n\nDriverless cars seem possible in the next few years, but I don't see any reason why we need them. Maybe for older folks having trouble, or someone so rich they just get one to say they have one\u2026 But everyone? Just sitting there with whoever you're with?\n\nEvolution is a big deal to be a part of in this generation, but it's simple if you have the idea.  If it's big enough to make people notice, then you have your platform.  Changing how people get around is a huge industry. Competition's always there, and there's always going to be something better.  Wouldn't you rather drive yourself everywhere or just sit doing nothing, waiting your turn?",
        "Here's my rewrite of the text, maintaining the professional, scientific tone and structure of the reference text while improving the clarity and organization:\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" has been conclusively proven to be a natural formation, not an alien artifact. As a planetary scientist studying Martian geology, I can present three compelling pieces of evidence that definitively refute claims of artificial origin.\n\nFirst, the original Viking 1 photographs that sparked public imagination were taken under specific lighting conditions that created misleading shadows. These shadows, combined with the low-resolution imagery (43 meters per pixel), produced an illusory face-like appearance that captured public attention but held no scientific merit.\n\nSecond, and most conclusively, the Mars Global Surveyor's 2001 high-resolution imaging campaign provided unprecedented detail of the formation, with each pixel representing just 1.56 meters. These detailed images revealed what geologists had long suspected: the \"face\" is merely a mesa, a common geological formation similar to those found in Earth's American Southwest. The improved resolution completely dispelled any resemblance to a carved monument.\n\nThird, the practical implications of an alien artifact on Mars would be revolutionary. If credible evidence of artificial construction existed, it would trigger unprecedented funding and accelerate human Mars exploration efforts. The fact that our Mars exploration proceeds at its current measured pace further supports the natural origin of this formation.\n\nThe scientific consensus is clear: the \"Face on Mars\" represents a fascinating example of pareidolia\u2014our human tendency to see patterns, especially faces, in random natural formations. While this mesa in Mars's Cydonia region may have briefly captured our imaginations, detailed scientific investigation has thoroughly demonstrated its natural origins.\n\n[Note: I've maintained the core arguments while elevating the language and adding scientific context, following the professional tone of the first reference text while preserving the key points from the second.]",
        "The discourse surrounding the progress of autonomous vehicles has ignited considerable controversy in recent times. Despite the enticing array of advantages this technology offers, my stance opposes its widespread proliferation, citing concerns elucidated in \u201cDriverless Cars are Coming.\u201d The manifold risks entailing cybersecurity breaches, ethical quandaries, and economic ramifications present formidable obstacles that overshadow the potential benefits these automobiles may bring. Therefore, directing attention towards enhancing conventional driving methods appears to be a more judicious path.\n\nOne prominent argument against driverless cars underscores their susceptibility to hacking exploits and cyber threats. As delineated in the article, despite efforts to fortify these vehicles with sophisticated security measures against digital intrusions, no system can claim absolute invulnerability. A successful breach could not only lead to data theft but also precipitate imminent hazards by seizing command of vehicles navigating our thoroughfares. This glaring vulnerability forebodes catastrophic scenarios where sinister actors could manipulate vehicular networks at whim, endangering public safety on a massive scale\u2014a stark contrast to human-operated conveyances where mishaps typically arise as isolated incidents.\n\nMoreover, an ethical conundrum looms over the decisions made by autonomous systems in critical junctures\u2014a narrative vividly encapsulated through contemplation of moral accountability amidst inevitable emergencies highlighted in \u201cDriverless Cars are Coming.\u201d Unlike humans who may exercise nuanced judgment grounded on context or instinctive impulses during crises\u2014like prioritizing lives based on perceived severity\u2014algorithms driving automated systems hew closely to preordained logical patterns devoid of genuine moral reflection or adaptability necessary for making high-stakes split-second determinations.

        "The dawn of autonomous vehicles heralds a potentially transformative era in transportation, yet this ostensibly utopian prospect is laden with unforeseen perils.  I contend that the evolution of self-driving cars necessitates a profoundly cautious approach, prioritizing stringent safety protocols and ethical frameworks before their ubiquitous deployment. While advocates extol the virtues of enhanced efficiency and broadened accessibility, the nascent state of this technology presents substantial anxieties surrounding both safety and widespread job displacement.  As elucidated in \"Driverless Cars are Coming,\" the susceptibility of these systems to software malfunctions and malicious cyberattacks presents a spectrum of catastrophic accident scenarios.  Moreover, the article recognizes the impending economic upheaval stemming from the automation of millions of driving positions, impacting families and communities whose livelihoods are inextricably linked to the transportation sector.\n\nFixating solely on the allure of convenience obfuscates the intricate realities surrounding autonomous vehicles.  The article aptly raises the complex ethical quandaries inherent in unavoidable accidents: how will an autonomous vehicle adjudicate between the safety of its occupants and that of vulnerable pedestrians?  These are not abstract hypotheticals but rather tangible, real-world dilemmas demanding meticulous deliberation.  Furthermore, the article underscores the prevailing limitations of driverless cars, particularly their struggles to navigate inclement weather conditions or the often unpredictable nuances of human behavior.  Until these critical issues are resolved through rigorous testing and sustained development, advocating for the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles remains premature, even perilous.",
        "The paper \u201cThe Challenge of Exploring Venus\u201d successfully presents the need for Venus study as a necessary effort despite the high risks involved in sending a mission to the planet. The author supports this claim by noting the importance of scientific exploration to Venus, the interest of humanity in learning more about the universe, and the existing risks that come with it. The author also notes that the challenges of exploring Venus, for instance, the heat and pressure in the atmosphere, before effectively presenting reasons why it is crucial to explore the planet.  The author also highlights that there is great potential in the scientific area that can be gained from exploring Venus. When the author explains that Venus can be used as a natural laboratory to compare how planets develop differently over time based on factors such as their distance to the sun or their internal structure, the author shows how learning more about Venus can help in the understanding of Earth\u2019s physical events. Furthermore, when discussing the light that can be gained from researching Venus to understand other questions regarding habitability in the solar system and further, such as whether other rocky planets can support life under extremely harsh conditions as on Venus, the author effectively strengthens the point that it is important to investigate this dangerous region in order to improve science.  Therefore, although it is true that the exploration of Venus is challenging because of the extreme conditions on the planet, \u201cThe Challenge of Exploring Venus\u201d properly conveys that these difficulties should not prevent scientific exploration of this little understood planet.",

        "Here's my rewrite of the text, maintaining the informal, conversational style and repetitive structure of the reference text:\n\nExploring space is amazing, especially when it comes to Venus, which is super interesting but also really dangerous to study. Looking at \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" we can see why scientists think it's totally worth checking out this mysterious planet, even though it's pretty risky. When you look at all the facts in the article, it's clear that studying Venus is definitely something we should do, even with all the dangers involved.\n\nThe article shows how Venus is great for learning about planets like Earth because they're basically like cousins - similar size and everything. Like, when scientists look at Venus's crazy atmosphere and how hot it is, they can figure out stuff about Earth's climate too. That's super helpful for understanding what might happen to our planet and how we can deal with environmental problems here.\n\nAnd get this - studying Venus is awesome for making new technology too. Scientists have to come up with really cool spacecraft and tools that won't melt or break in Venus's super harsh environment. That's not just good for space stuff - it helps us make better robots and machines for other things too. It's like when you have to solve a really hard problem, you end up learning all sorts of useful things along the way.\n\nThe article talks about how Venus is super hot and has this really nasty atmosphere that can destroy things, but scientists are like \"we got this!\" They work together and use really smart technology to figure things out. They've already sent some successful missions to Venus, which shows it's totally possible to study it if we try hard enough. It's kind of like when you have a really hard video game level - it seems impossible at first, but then you figure out how to beat it.\n\nSo yeah, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" really shows why we should keep studying this crazy planet. Even though it's super dangerous and hard to explore, we learn so much cool stuff that it's totally worth it. It's like the article says - when we push ourselves to do hard things in space, we end up learning more about everything, not just Venus.",
        "A landform on Mars that resembled a human face was photographed by NASA's Viking 1 mission in the late 1970s, leading to much conjecture over its origins. While some say this \"Face on Mars\" is a handiwork of alien intelligence, scientific data firmly supports the argument that it is only a natural landform. Low resolution and particular lighting circumstances produced an optical illusion in the original photograph, which was captured from a high orbit. High-resolution photographs from later missions, such the Mars Global Surveyor in the late 1990s, showed that the so-called face was actually a mesa, a flat-topped hill formed by natural erosion processes. The lack of symmetrical elements in these pictures further refuted the notion that the edifice was man-made. \n\n\nFurthermore, the haphazard pattern that briefly resembled a face may be readily explained by wind erosion and other geological processes spanning millions of years. The article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" highlights that a major contributing factor to these misunderstandings is pareidolia, the human propensity to perceive familiar patterns where none exist. Our knowledge of Martian topography as a result of natural causes is strengthened by our ability to safely conclude that the Face on Mars is a natural geological formation rather than an alien artifact based on the scientific data and psychological factors at play.",

Back in 1976, Viking 1 captured images that got people wondering about alien life. NASA and other space agencies have studied this formation, and the evidence shows it's just a natural part of the Martian landscape.\n\nScientists have been investigating the Face on Mars for many years. As of 1976, Viking 1 took the first pictures that started all the excitement. The images could show almost anything. The downfall was that the pictures were low-quality and taken at specific angles that made shadows look like facial features. These images created lots of speculation, but newer technology has given us better views of what's really there.\n\nThe majority of scientific missions to Mars now use high-resolution cameras and advanced imaging systems.\n\nThese systems allow scientists to see the formation clearly, showing it's just a hill shaped by natural processes like wind and erosion. The better pictures prove there's nothing artificial about it, making the whole area as normal as any other part of Mars.\n\nAs of now, many people still want to believe in artificial structures on Mars. They are interested in the idea of ancient alien civilizations and mysterious monuments.",

Though these self-piloting machines promise a pantheon of advantages\u2014chief among them enhanced safety protocols and unprecedented convenience\u2014they simultaneously harbor considerable risks that warrant careful scrutiny. Despite acknowledging the innovative merits of autonomous vehicles, I find myself firmly positioned against their wholesale implementation, primarily due to pressing safety concerns and the specter of widespread occupational displacement.\n\nProponents of self-driving technology frequently trumpet its potential to mitigate vehicular accidents stemming from human fallibility. The article's striking statistic\u2014that 94% of automotive incidents arise from human shortcomings, including inebriated operation and momentary inattention\u2014certainly commands attention. Yet, while autonomous systems might theoretically diminish such statistics through their sophisticated array of sensors and algorithmic decision-making protocols, this theoretical benefit pales in comparison to the profound vulnerabilities inherent in relying on technology susceptible to both malfunction and malicious interference. The article's documentation of fatal incidents during testing phases serves as a sobering reminder of artificial intelligence's limitations when confronted with the kaleidoscopic complexity of real-world scenarios. Perhaps most troubling is the philosophical quandary surrounding split-second ethical decisions\u2014how can we entrust machines with moral calculations about human life in inevitable collision scenarios?\n\nThe socioeconomic reverberations of widespread autonomous vehicle adoption demand equal consideration. The article's prognostication of massive job displacement extends beyond the immediate transportation sector, threatening to upend adjacent industries from automotive maintenance to insurance underwriting. This seismic shift could precipitate unprecedented unemployment levels and social instability unless accompanied by comprehensive vocational retraining initiatives\u2014an undertaking of staggering magnitude. While the siren song of autonomous vehicles beckons with promises of enhanced safety and operational efficiency, their potential perils and far-reaching economic implications suggest a more measured approach is warranted. Rather than pursuing full autonomy, we might better serve society by refining existing driver-assistance technologies (ADAS), thereby augmenting human capabilities without wholly supplanting human agency or triggering widespread economic disruption.",
        "The belief that aliens crafted the Face on Mars, though intriguing, stems from a well-intentioned yet flawed interpretation of an extraordinary natural spectacle. The initial 1976 photograph captured by Viking 1 seemed to depict a humanoid visage etched into the Martian terrain. However, subsequent high-resolution imagery provided by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has categorically shown it to be a mere mesa, sculpted over millions of years through natural geological activity. These sharper images clarify that what appeared as facial features were merely products of erosion, shadows, and the primitive resolution of the original snapshot. The \"eyes\" and \"nose\" are nothing more than naturally occurring hollows and elevations; their apparent symmetry vanishes when observed from various perspectives with enhanced clarity. This phenomenon epitomizes pareidolia\u2014the brain's inclination to discern familiar patterns like faces within random stimuli. Moreover, Cydonia, the region housing this formation, is replete with similar mesas and landforms born of identical geological forces.

        "In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" Trafton talks about\u2002the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, a revolutionary technique designed for machines to recognize the emotion of humans. The idea of an application for FACS to teach students,\u2002especially in classrooms, excites some but alarms some as well as inexperienced learners face the threat of abuse. You are trained on or about Oct\u20022023. For example, if the teacher learns about a student being confused or overwhelmed, it can act in real time and offer immediate help to the\u2002individual. This can promote learning since no\u2002student will be left behind due to cognitive or emotional barriers that are unaddressed and thus impeding their learning. The best part however is, data that is in storage can allow for some sort of social behavior profile which means this technology can allow school administrators or college campuses the opportunity to early detect bullying, social isolation or any other unwanted phenomena and allow campuses to\u2002take proactive actions towards making campuses a more inclusive and a supportive environment.\n\nBut even in classrooms there remain some ethical and practical issues\u2002around the use of FACS. One major concern is privacy. The real-time observation of students' facial expressions could be seen to be intrusive and result in heightened anxiety\u2002or self-consciousness in students. This may change their natural behavior, preventing\u2002the capture of sincere emotional responses. Moreover, there is a possibility of malinterpretation since FACS is limited to observable facial\u2002expressions that can be deceptive at times. A child who seems disinterested may just be an introvert who chews over information\u2002internally, not necessarily someone who struggles, or is bored. Overconfidence in FACS may induce wrenching missteps resulting\u2002in net deleterious outcomes. And then there's\u2002the question of consent. Students, particularly younger ones, may not appreciate the implications of being tracked this way, and the question arises whether it is ethical to use such technology in\u2002an educational environment.\n\nThus, despite the potential of the Facial Action Coding System to augment the education experience through uncovering deeper insights into student emotions, its adoption in the classroom must be monitored to ensure the full variety of factors that\u2002contribute to educational success can be communicated.

        "Here's my rewrite of the NASA text, matching the informal, conversational style of the reference text:\n\ni think its really important to talk about this whole Face on Mars thing because like a lot of people think aliens made it but thats not true and as someone who works at NASA i can tell you why. there's this really good article called 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' that shows how its just a natural thing that happened and not some alien creation.\n\nso like one of the best reasons we know its natural is because we see stuff that looks just like it right here on Earth. the article talks about how things like volcanoes and erosion can make these weird shapes without any aliens being involved at all and this happens in different places on Earth. plus we know that wind and weather on Mars can do the same kind of stuff which totally proves it wasnt aliens making these shapes.\n\nand you know whats really cool is that we have these spacecraft like Viking Orbiter that took these super detailed pictures of the Face on Mars and they show us exactly how it formed naturally. when you look at these pictures you can see all these patterns from erosion and layers of dirt and rock that match exactly what we see happening naturally on Earth and Mars.",
        "I'll help rewrite the text while maintaining the same informal, persuasive style and student-focused perspective of the reference text. Here's the rewritten version:\n\nExploring Venus holds tremendous scientific value, but we need to carefully weigh the benefits against the very real challenges we face. Think about it - when scientists want to study Venus, they can't just send up any old spacecraft. The planet's extreme conditions make it about as welcoming as a pizza oven filled with acid rain!\n\nJust like how you wouldn't force a friend to share their feelings when they're having a bad day, we can't force immediate results from Venus exploration. The process takes time, patience, and careful planning. Sure, we could learn amazing things about climate change by studying Venus's intense greenhouse effect - it's like having a natural laboratory for understanding what happens when carbon dioxide goes wild. But rushing in without proper preparation would be like trying to take a test without studying.\n\nThe technology we'd need to develop is pretty mind-blowing - imagine creating materials that can withstand temperatures hot enough to melt lead! These innovations could definitely help us back on Earth, kind of like how space research gave us things we use every day (think memory foam mattresses and scratch-resistant lenses).",

        "As a NASA scientist, I appreciate the allure of the enigmatic \"Face on Mars,\" but it's imperative to distinguish between captivating conjecture and verifiable scientific evidence.  This formation, initially imaged by the Viking 1 Orbiter in 1976, ignited considerable public fascination due to its perceived resemblance to human features.  However, subsequent imagery, captured in exquisite detail by the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, has definitively revealed its true nature: a naturally occurring Martian mesa. What once hinted at eyes, a nose, and a mouth under the limitations of earlier technology are now understood to be mere illusions, born from the interplay of light and shadow.\n\nThe scientific method compels us to prioritize empirical data over speculation. The perceived visage in this Martian landform exemplifies pareidolia, the well-documented psychological phenomenon in which the human brain discerns familiar patterns, such as faces, within random or ambiguous stimuli.  More comprehensive photographic surveys reveal irregular contours entirely consistent with other Martian mesas sculpted by eons of wind erosion and other geological forces. Notably absent are any artifacts or accompanying structures that might hint at intelligent design or artificial construction.  Consequently, ascribing this formation to extraterrestrial artistry lacks any substantive foundation.  Adhering to the principle of Occam's Razor, the most straightforward explanation \u2013 that the \"Face on Mars\" is a product of natural processes \u2013 emerges as the most probable.",
        "Here's an enriched version of the text, maintaining its core message while enhancing its linguistic sophistication:\n\nThe integration of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) within educational spaces emerges as a double-edged sword, simultaneously offering tantalizing possibilities and raising profound ethical quandaries that demand rigorous examination. This cutting-edge technology, capable of deciphering learners' emotional landscapes through minute facial movements, could revolutionize pedagogical approaches by equipping educators with instantaneous insights into student engagement and comprehension patterns. Such capabilities might pave the way for extraordinarily nimble and individualized instructional methodologies.\n\nYet beneath this veneer of technological promise lurks a more complex reality. The omnipresent gaze of surveillance systems might fundamentally disrupt the organic ecosystem of learning, casting a shadow over authentic classroom dynamics. Students, cognizant of continuous monitoring, might feel compelled to orchestrate artificial displays of attentiveness or understanding\u2014a performance that could stifle genuine emotional responses and impede authentic learning processes.\n\nFurthermore, the algorithmic interpretation of facial expressions presents its own set of challenges. The technology's framework may prove inadequate in navigating the rich tapestry of cultural variations in emotional expression, or in capturing the intricate internal states that often defy external manifestation.",
        "The so-called \u201cFace on Mars\u201d has captured the public imagination for decades,\u2002with people speculating that it vindicated the existence of an ancient civilization on Mars. As a NASA scientist who has studied this fascinating landform in depth, I can tell you, there is compelling evidence for\u2002its natural origins. The first grainy image, taken by the\u2002Viking orbiter in 1976, revealed a mesa-like structure that somewhat resembled a face. That was a low-res image and under certain\u2002lighting conditions created an optical illusion to the point that some people saw it as an artificial construct. This childish reading of the data, while cute for October\u20022023 standards, mostly confirms that we were dummies before we had more sophisticated instruments. Most importantly, we must rely on scientific evidence, rather than wishful\u2002thinking, to interpret the Martian terrain.\n\nMissions that followed, carrying higher resolution cameras including the Mars Global\u2002Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have captured much clearer views of the \"Face\" and the Cydonia region where it sits. These images show a natural, eroded mesa, a common geological\u2002feature on Mars. These\u2002so-called \"facial features\" are just shadows and ridges carved by wind erosion and other natural geological processes over eons. The higher resolution dispels the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth, revealing a typical\u2002Martian mesa. Moreover, the Viking photo of the \"Face\" was taken at a particular time when the lighting\u2002enhanced the shadowing and added to the illusion. Subsequent images, captured at different angles of lighting, clearly reveal the\u2002mesa\u2019s natural shape. We have precious little reliable data to go on and we will have to formulate preliminary theories based on the evidence we have available: And every bit\u2002of evidence available shows the \"Face\" on Mars is a natural geological formation\u2014this is the inescapable conclusion based on the evidence. And there you have it\u2014conclusive data beats speculation every time, and the \"Face\" stands as a testament to the power of perspective and the importance\u2002of holding even the most tantalizing (and seemingly obvious) hypotheses to rigorous scientific standards.",

        "Deciphering the enigmatic Martian landscape and its geological intricacies is crucial to the advancement of space exploration.  The so-called \"Face on Mars,\" a curious landform nestled within the Cydonia region, has ignited considerable controversy and conjecture, particularly among those who posit it as a relic of ancient extraterrestrial civilization.  However, my position as a NASA scientist necessitates a reasoned elucidation anchored in empirical evidence.  The Face on Mars is a natural phenomenon, and a multitude of compelling arguments substantiate this assertion.\n\nFirstly, high-resolution imagery captured by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) has definitively unveiled the Face not as a visage, but rather as a mesa, or a flat-topped elevation. These photographs, acquired from diverse perspectives and under varying illuminations, expose the landform's true morphology, devoid of any anthropomorphic characteristics.  Indeed, the initial semblance to a human face, observed by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976, stemmed from a combination of low image resolution and fortuitous lighting. This perceptual illusion, termed pareidolia, predisposes humans to perceive familiar patterns in otherwise random configurations.  Furthermore, adjacent geological formations, including pinnacles and other mesas, display analogous attributes, bolstering the conclusion that the Face is a product of natural geomorphological processes.  Geological investigations suggest that aeolian erosion, volcanic activity, and the disintegration of less resilient materials have sculpted these features over eons.\n\nIn summation, while the notion of the Face on Mars as an artifact of alien construction possesses a certain allure, the preponderance of evidence unequivocally supports a natural genesis.  High-resolution imaging, coupled with the established tenets of geology, furnishes a lucid explanation for this enigmatic landform.  As members of the scientific community, our obligation is to ground our understanding in verifiable data and rigorous logic, rather than succumbing to fanciful interpretations.",

People everywhere got super excited and jumped right to thinking aliens must have built it. But as someone who knows the science, I can tell you it's actually just a natural formation that happens to look face-like.\n\nNASA wasn't satisfied with just one look, so they went back for better pictures in April 1998. These new shots made it pretty clear it was just a regular old hill formation. But some folks weren't convinced because the pictures were taken on a cloudy winter day. No problem! NASA tried again on April 8, 2001, picking a perfect, clear summer day for the best possible view.",
        "Have you ever been intrigued by the enigmatic \"Face on Mars,\" sparking speculation of extraterrestrial craftsmanship? Allow me, as a NASA scientist, to offer reassurance that this compelling structure is but a natural geological formation, shaped over time by Earthly processes rather than by alien hands. In 1976, the initial image captured by the Viking orbiter depicted a mesa-like shape resembling a human face. Yet, due to the camera's low resolution and specific lighting conditions at that moment, this illusion was crafted. Subsequent images from higher-tech equipment like the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) unveiled a more weathered and less anthropomorphic appearance. These clearer images captured from diverse vantage points and enhanced lighting unveil the reality behind this feature\u2014a natural mesa sculpted by eons of wind erosion. The \"Face on Mars\" is merely an illusion cast by play of light and darkness\u2014an instance of pareidolia: our tendency to perceive recognizable patterns in randomness. The weight of evidence corroborates that this Martian marvel is purely geological\u2014a testament to nature\u2019s artistry on Mars; not an artifact left behind by interstellar travelers.",
        "The Face on Mars has long captivated the imagination of many, fueling theories about extraterrestrial life and ancient civilizations. However, after reading 'Unmasking the Face on Mars,' it becomes clear that this intriguing formation is nothing more than a natural landform. Scientific evidence, supported by high-resolution imaging and geological analysis, refutes the idea that the Face was made by extraterrestrials.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments for the natural origin of the Face on Mars lies in its geographical context. High-resolution images captured by spacecraft reveal eroded hills and valleys surrounding the structure. These features, typical of erosion caused by wind and water over millennia, suggest that the Face is most likely the result of geological processes. The article emphasizes how the surrounding landscape provides crucial context for understanding the formation's origins.\n\nAnother key point highlighted in the article is the role of shadows and visual perception in creating the illusion of a face. Researchers have found that the arrangement of the formation lacks artificial patterns or symmetry. Instead, they concluded that shadows cast at specific angles, when viewed from particular perspectives, create the appearance of facial features. This phenomenon, known as pareidolia, explains how our brains often recognize familiar patterns, such as faces, where none actually exist.\n\nWhile the idea of alien craftsmanship may be appealing, scientific investigation offers a more grounded explanation. The combination of geological context, the absence of intentional design features, and the influence of shadows on perception all point to the Face on Mars being a natural formation.",

        "The enigmatic \"Face on Mars\" has held the public's imagination captive for decades, igniting speculation about ancient Martian civilizations.  However, from my perspective as a NASA scientist, I can confidently assert that this compelling formation is a product of natural geological forces, not extraterrestrial design.  The initial, indistinct images captured by the Viking orbiter in 1976, depicting a mesa vaguely resembling a face, provided fodder for these theories of alien artistry.  Subsequent exploration, utilizing sophisticated imaging technology, has unequivocally dispelled this misconception.  Enhanced resolution has revealed the \"Face\" to be a characteristic Martian mesa, sculpted and eroded by wind and other natural phenomena over eons, a commonplace occurrence on the crimson planet.\n\nThe assertion of artificial construction is predicated solely on the original, low-fidelity image, a prime example of pareidolia\u2014the human propensity to discern familiar patterns in random information.  Later images acquired by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) in 1998 and 2001, and the European Space Agency\u2019s Mars Express orbiter in 2006, presented the formation in breathtaking clarity.  These images unequivocally portray a natural mesa, its illusory facial features dissolved by the improved perspectives.  The initial shadowy countenance metamorphosed into a standard Martian butte, a testament to the deceptive nature of low-resolution imagery and the potent influence of suggestion.\n\nThus, the \"Face on Mars,\" while initially intriguing, is ultimately a naturally occurring landform shaped by the geological processes of Mars.",
        "The integration of technology in educational settings has ignited discussions regarding its impact on student engagement and emotional responses. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as detailed in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" represents a groundbreaking leap forward in computer-based emotion recognition. While this technology holds promise for educators to gain insights into their students' emotional states and learning experiences, its application in classrooms raises significant concerns about privacy, authenticity, and the fundamental essence of human interaction within education.\n\nThe potential advantages of incorporating FACS into educational environments are compelling. Teachers, often tasked with managing sizable classes, could receive immediate feedback on their students' emotional involvement with the material. By identifying when a substantial portion of the class is confused or frustrated, educators could promptly adjust their teaching methods or pace. This tool could be particularly beneficial for pinpointing struggling students who may be hesitant to speak up, enabling more timely and targeted support interventions. Moreover, the system could assist teachers in refining their teaching strategies by offering objective data on which instructional approaches evoke positive emotional responses and heightened engagement from students.\n\nNevertheless, deploying emotion-reading technology in classrooms poses serious ethical and practical challenges that cannot be dismissed. Students aware of being under surveillance may feel compelled to maintain artificial displays of interest or comprehension, potentially fostering an environment where performance takes precedence over genuine learning experiences. This constant monitoring could elevate anxiety levels and self-awareness among students, potentially impeding rather than facilitating the learning process. Furthermore, questions persist regarding the technology's accuracy in interpreting complex human emotions across diverse cultural backgrounds and individual variances; what may seem like disengagement to an algorithm might simply reflect a student's natural processing expression or cultural method of demonstrating attentiveness.\n\nWhile FACS technology presents alluring possibilities for enriching educational experiences, its current limitations and potential adverse effects overshadow its benefits within classroom settings. The classroom should serve as a space where students feel encouraged to express themselves authentically while cultivating genuine relationships with educators and peers alike. Rather than relying solely on automated emotion recognition systems , teachers should concentrate on honing their interpersonal skills and creating environments that foster open communication wherein students feel at ease expressing their needs directly . Technology can undoubtedly complement education but should not supplant human discernment when it comes to recognizing emotional cues through authentic interactions  . Ultimately,the objective   encompasses beyond mere transfer information comprises nurturing  intelligence social abilities - capacities optimally cultivated through genuinehuman connections over algorithmic analyses.",

        "In my role as a researcher at NASA, I've often engaged with individuals who uphold the belief that the enigmatic Face on Mars is a handiwork of extraterrestrial beings. Yet, following exhaustive investigation and meticulous scrutiny of the data at hand, I am steadfast in my conviction that the enigmatic countenance is nothing more than a product of natural phenomena. While this stance may appear incredulous to some, accumulated evidence strongly indicates that the Face is merely an intricate amalgamation of geological formations.\n\nA predominant assertion made by proponents of the alien hypothesis revolves around the perceived symmetry of the Face \u2013 deemed too perfect to be naturally occurring. However, an insightful exploration detailed in \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" reveals that this supposed symmetry is not as flawless upon closer examination. Delving deeper exposes a medley of natural elements such as plateaus and craters which, over time and through erosion, conspired to create an illusion reminiscent of facial features.\n\nThe aforementioned article presents compelling evidence buttressing this argument by spotlighting how the Face comprises not one seamless structure but rather an assembly of distinct landforms. For instance, what appears as a \"mouth\" transpires to be a natural concavity while its \"eyes\" are nothing more than twin craters shaped by geological forces over epochs. This body of evidence posits that far from being deliberate artifice, the Face owes its existence to aeons-worth of weathering and erosion.\n\nMoreover, it underscores how analogous formations can be encountered here on Earth further demystifying any purported extraterrestrial origin for such features on Mars. This observation intimates that processes responsible for crafting Martian enigmas like the Face are neither exceptional nor beyond terrestrial comprehension but instead form part and parcel of planetary geological metamorphosis. By scrutinizing akin phenomena present on our own planet's landscape, we stand poised to deepen our grasp over Martian geology's mysterious machinations.\n\nIn closing, while speculations about an alien-crafted visage adorning Mars may hold allure yet scrupulous analysis propels us towards recognizing it for what it truly embodies \u2013 nature's handiwork sculpted through eons-old geological processes rather than intentional construction. As custodians of scientific inquiry tasked with unraveling such enigmas with discernment and sagacity instead we ought wield skepticism toward sensational leaps in judgment.",

        "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as described in \u201cMaking Mona Lisa Smile,\u201d is quite intriguing, but when applied to classrooms, it is fraught with serious problems.  I think that supporters of FACS might say that it could help teachers to identify students who are quietly frustrated or bored and allow them to step in before things get worse, but this benefit is far outweighed by the potential for misinterpretation and misuse.  Because FACS analyzes micro-expressions, fleeting involuntary movements, they may not necessarily correspond to the emotional state of a student.  In addition, the constant monitoring may lead to the suppression of student participation in the classroom, which can lead to increased anxiety and self-consciousness.  This is because emotion is a rather subjective area of study, and when coupled with the inherent shortcomings of technology, the large-scale application of FACS in classrooms is both ethically doubtful and educationally flawed.  Student privacy and the creation of a positive learning environment should be the priority, not technological solutions that can easily misread and mislabel the complex emotions of humans.",

Venus, on the otherhand, is complety built for the purpose of exploring and analizing planetary evolution. The feature most appealing to me and that fixes this issue is found here in the passage, \"Venus, once thought to have harbored oceans, is now a scorching inferno with a toxic atmosphere...\".\n\nThe second issue with Earth is its limited perspective on climate change being to narrow. Some planets just do not have the conditions to be able to show the extremes of a runaway greenhouse effect fast enough to give an example. Venus does it instantly, as stated in the passage, \"Studying Venus offers a unique opportunity to understand the processes that drive climate change, providing invaluable insights...\".\n\nFinaly, sometimes planets just are not a good example. Doing anything from having perfect conditions for life or evolving to slowly can be extreamly misleading to our understanding of planets or anything around them.  Venus can prevent that by even forcing scientists to look beyond Earth constantly or alerting us when a planet might become like Venus. \"Venus, once thought to have harbored oceans, is now a scorching inferno...\".

        "My personal position on this matter is against exploring Venus. Because with this new technology, scientists must still prepare for intense conditions, but only in some situations. If the probe functions autonomously most of the time, then when it encounters an unexpected atmospheric anomaly, the scientists will do one of two things. If the probe detects the anomaly and doesn't know what to do, it will signal the scientists, but if the scientists are not prepared or not monitoring the data, they cannot respond in time to save the mission. Another outcome can be if the probe\u2019s sensors are not facing the anomaly, the probe will not \"see\" it and malfunction. Who is responsible for the loss? Is it the probe or the scientists?\n\nAs shown at the end of paragraph 3, when there is debate in the scientific community about a mission failure, who is accountable? Also, to make matters worse, if something like the scenario I wrote above would happen, who is at fault, and that now causes a dispute between the scientists and the engineers.  The team could be blamed for not monitoring the data when\u2026 data, when all that team did was trust the probe. I have read the article and never did see anything about an override from the scientists. Which means if the scientists did see the atmospheric anomaly and they wanted to intervene, they couldn't, and then if the probe is lost are they now responsible for this failure?\n\n\nMost planetary probes alert the scientists to take control if there are unexpected data readings. As shown in paragraph 2, but can the scientists be alerted in time to prevent a mission failure? Which causes even more possible problems, as explained in paragraph 1, none of the probes are fully autonomous and there are few ways being developed to alert the scientists, like automated reports and warning systems. But can those truly alert the scientists? To me, that gamble is too risky.",

        "When engaging in discussions with those who believe the renowned \"Face on Mars\" was crafted by extraterrestrial beings, it is essential to lean on scientific evidence and sound reasoning. This enigmatic formation, which came to light in 1976 through imagery captured by NASA's Viking 1 orbiter, has ignited fervent debate and wild speculations. Yet, a meticulous analysis of the data unmistakably reveals that this feature is merely a natural landform.\n\nOne of the foremost arguments supporting its natural origin pertains to the angle and lighting conditions present during its initial capture. The photograph that introduced us to this Martian visage featured lighting that cast shadows mimicking human facial characteristics. However, subsequent images taken from diverse perspectives and under various lighting scenarios have conclusively shown that this so-called Face is simply a mesa\u2014a flat-topped elevation\u2014bereft of definitive facial attributes. Such phenomena are commonplace in geology, where natural structures often mimic familiar forms due to optical play between light and shadow.\n\nFurther reinforcing its terrestrial origins are high-resolution images procured by the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001. These images far surpass the clarity of the initial Viking snapshots, unveiling a landform devoid of artificial constructs. The comprehensive topography depicted features no straight lines or geometric patterns suggestive of intelligent design; rather it displays an irregularity typical of naturally weathered geological formations.\n\nAdditionally, examining the geological context where this formation resides lends further weight to its natural provenance. Situated within Mars' Cydonia region\u2014an area rich with mesas and buttes\u2014the Face seemingly emerges from aeons-long erosion by wind and other environmental dynamics intrinsic to Martian landscapes over millennia. Similar formations peppering Cydonia underscore that identical forces shaped both them and this infamous feature.\n\nPrevailing consensus among scientists further corroborates this viewpoint: extensive research spearheaded by NASA along with partner space agencies unanimously point towards a purely geological origin for what some still romantically imagine as alien handiwork; cumulative empirical data thoroughly dispels notions advocating otherwise.",

If you read the article about the city, it says somewhere around paragraph two, \"Scientists figured it was just another Venusian volcano, common enough around Aphrodite Terra, only this one had unusual radar reflections that made it look like a ziggurat.\" So that quote states that the radar reflections are making it look like a city.\n\nOn April 5, 2048, the Venus Express II flew over Aphrodite Terra and ended up getting a picture ten times sharper than the original Magellan photos. In paragraph seven, where it says all the information, it says, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the ESA website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien city after all.\"  So this means that after they went over Aphrodite Terra, they discovered it was just a natural landform. But people still don't want to believe it was just a rock formation shaped naturally, not... doesn't want to believe it was just rock shaped naturally, not by \"aliens.\"\n\nI understand how people think it's made by aliens 'cause it looks so much like a city.

        "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is introduced In \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", revealing an intriguing perspective on how technology can be utilized to decipher human emotions. FACS operates by analyzing micro-expressions with the theoretical ability to detect subtle emotional hints that would normally escape our notice. Although this technology shows great potential in multiple fields, its implementation in classrooms brings about a host of significant ethical and practical issues for the purpose of discerning students' emotional states.\n\nTo use FACS for continuous surveillance in classrooms along with the high probability of misinterpreting complex emotional reactions have the potential to severely dampen students' willingness to express themselves and engage in the learning process. For instance, a student might be having a bad day due to personal issues at home, and the system could misinterpret their subdued expression as disinterest in the lesson.\n\nAdvocates of FACS in classrooms may claim that it can assist teachers in customizing their teaching to better address students' emotional requirements. Teachers could make immediate changes to their teaching approaches by recognizing signs such as frustration or boredom, which might enhance learning results. However, the effectiveness and accuracy of FACS in the ever - changing classroom environment are highly suspect. There are numerous factors that can affect students' emotional expressions and have nothing to do with the learning content.",
        "As a NASA scientist, I often encounter fascinating mysteries that capture public interest. One such mystery is the well-known \"Face on Mars,\" which has led to much speculation about its extraterrestrial origins. However, upon thorough investigation, it becomes evident that the Face is merely a natural landform formed by geological processes. In this essay, I will present strong arguments backed by evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' to refute the idea that the Face was made by aliens.\n\nTo begin with, a significant argument for the natural origin of the Face is its location in the Cydonia region, which is recognized for its distinctive topography shaped by erosion and other geological activities. The article notes that the Face is found in an area filled with mesas, buttes, and other landforms typical of a geologically varied landscape. This suggests that the Face is more likely the result of erosional processes rather than extraterrestrial involvement.\n\nAdditionally, the article examines photographic evidence from NASA's spacecraft, which shows that the Face looks different when viewed from various angles and under different lighting conditions. This change in appearance aligns with natural landforms influenced by light and shadow, rather than a structure intentionally created by intelligent beings. The symmetrical and proportional features of the Face can be attributed to the effects of geological forces over time.\n\nFurthermore, the article highlights that high-resolution images taken by more advanced spacecraft have enhanced our understanding of the Face's geological makeup. These images reveal intricate details that indicate the presence of sedimentary layers and rock formations typical of natural geological processes. The absence of clear artificial structures or markers further reinforces the argument that the Face is a result of natural erosion.\n\nIn summary, the evidence presented in 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' strongly supports the view that the Face is a natural landform shaped by geological processes.",
        "In the landscape of educational innovation, the emergence of technology has introduced a plethora of novel tools and concepts. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as detailed in the work \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" stands out as a particularly fascinating development among these. FACS is a technology that empowers computers to discern and decipher human emotions by analyzing facial expressions. Its potential application within the classroom environment is both captivating and thought-provoking, demanding thorough and careful examination.\n\nThe capacity to gauge students' emotional states accurately holds the promise of revolutionizing teaching methodologies from a positive perspective. Teachers could gain instantaneous, real-time awareness of how students are reacting to the lessons. For example, the teacher can promptly modify the teaching approach in a geometry class if the FACS enabled system detects a cluster of students displaying expressions associated with confusion. They might break down complex geometric proofs into simpler steps or use more relatable examples to clarify the concepts. This immediate response can significantly enhance the learning experience and ensure that students stay on track.\n\nFurthermore, FACS has the potential to act as a silent sentinel, identifying students who are grappling with internal struggles. Emotional health is a cornerstone of academic achievement. Schools can take proactive steps by detecting early signs of stress, anxiety, or even disengagement. School counselors or mental health experts can be alerted to provide timely support, which could prevent these emotional issues from snowballing into more serious problems that might impede a student's educational journey.\n\nNevertheless, the integration of this technology into classrooms is not without its ethical minefields.",
        "As a scientist working with NASA, I have encountered numerous individuals who are convinced that the so-called \"Face on Mars\" is an artificial structure crafted by extraterrestrial beings. However, I find myself in strong disagreement with this perspective. In my view, the Face is nothing more than a natural landform that has been misunderstood due to its peculiar appearance.\n\nThe article titled \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" offers compelling evidence to bolster my argument. For example, it points out that the Face resides in Cydonia, a region distinguished by numerous mesas and buttes shaped through erosion. This information suggests that the formation of the Face likely resulted from similar geological processes. Moreover, high-resolution photographs of this feature reveal an array of parallel ridges and grooves\u2014characteristics typical of natural formations created by tectonic activity.\n\nIn summary, the evidence presented in this article robustly supports the conclusion that Mars's enigmatic Face is indeed a natural landform rather than an alien artifact. The geological context and structural attributes unequivocally suggest a natural origin. Therefore, I am steadfast in my belief that what some perceive as a mysterious alien relic is actually an intriguing example of Mars's complex and unique geological landscape.",

This surveillance-like atmosphere might paradoxically suppress the very emotional authenticity the system aims to understand.",
        "Since NASA's Viking 1 orbiter first captured an image of the feature in 1976 the debate about what Enthusiasts call \"The Face on Mars\" has persisted ever since. Many people think that this feature proves the existence of an old civilization on Mars because it looks artificial. The scientific method proves that normal natural forces created this feature because wind erosion formed it throughout millions of years.  The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) high-resolution images from 1998 and 2001 serve as the most compelling evidence that the Face appears differently depending on viewing angle and lighting conditions. Images taken from different angles with changing light conditions reveal the feature looks more like a irregular mesa than a face. The shading of the formation creates a face-like appearance but this is a recognized optical illusion called pareidolia through which humans see patterns that look like things or people. The MGS spectrometers analyzed the composition of the landform and found it looked like typical natural Martian rock formations which supports a natural origin for the Face.  Although considering the idea of an extraterrestrial structure builds an interesting theory the scientific data strongly supports that the so-called Face on Mars exists because of natural geological events.",
        "In \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explores the groundbreaking Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a technology engineered to decipher human emotions through the nuanced analysis of facial expressions.  Originally developed for psychological studies, this sophisticated tool offers promising applications across diverse sectors, most notably in education.

Continuously monitoring students\u2019 emotions risks fostering an intrusive atmosphere, one where learners feel under surveillance rather than supported.  Such an environment could potentially inhibit authentic emotional expression and creativity, particularly if students perceive themselves as perpetually scrutinized by machines instead of receiving genuine acknowledgment from their instructors.  Furthermore, excessive dependence on automated systems may erode teachers' capacity to cultivate essential qualities such as empathy and intuition\u2014crucial attributes for forging meaningful connections with students that transcend the capabilities of any algorithm.\n\nDespite these potential pitfalls, when implemented judiciously as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, traditional teaching methods, FACS possesses the capacity to substantially enhance pedagogical practices. The objective is not to supplant human judgment but to augment it, providing supplementary data points typically inaccessible through conventional classroom interaction.  Teachers armed with both sophisticated technological tools like FACS and their own seasoned pedagogical expertise can cultivate a more inclusive learning experience, meticulously tailored to each student's unique emotional landscape. This can be achieved without compromising the integrity of personal interaction or violating the ethical privacy standards established within educational institutions globally.  These communities continuously strive towards equitable access and opportunities for all individuals, irrespective of socio-economic background, based solely on merit, free from bias and prejudice.  While this ideal remains, regrettably, an aspiration in many regions, the relentless pursuit of educational excellence through innovation offers hope for a future where technology empowers, rather than impedes, the human connection at the heart of effective teaching.",
        "Some folks thought the swirling clouds of Venus were signs of alien jungles, and some still do. This is a theory that's been debunked countless times by us scientists at NASA. When we first peered through the clouds, there was a degree of surprise among the mission controllers. But they soon figured it was just another scorching hellscape, pretty common in the inner solar system. Only this one had different cloud patterns that gave the appearance of lush vegetation, which caused theories of it being an extraterrestrial rainforest.\n\nWhen we unveiled the radar images of the planet\u2019s surface to the public, it had been captioned that it showed \u201cpotential highland plateaus\u2026which resemble continents\u2026formed by radar reflections giving the illusion of landmasses and oceans.\u201d This had been done to attract attention, and it did. People began to think Venus was a second Earth teeming with life that NASA would rather hide.  But, our NASA budgeters wish there *was* life on Venus because it would benefit our investigations and bring in more\u2026 well, you get the picture.  The Magellan probe, with its high-resolution radar, captured breathtaking images. These images show that the supposed continents are volcanic plains and towering mountains.  These are common features on rocky planets and prove that the Venusian surface is just a really, *really* hot place.\n\nI do understand why people may have thought that Venus was teeming with Venusian dinosaurs, but us workers at NASA gave real evidence that it wasn't. Our mission controllers took numerous radar scans showing more and more proof that it was just another scorching rock. The mission controllers used instruments with extreme precision that had the ability to see giant ferns or megafauna if there were any. But there wasn't, and there still isn't.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that there is no rainforest-like jungle on Venus because there is no actual evidence proving my belief wrong. To all those who still believe Venus is a hidden paradise teeming with alien life, I truly hope you will read this and realize that theories are theories until proven true.",

These hallmark traits are quintessential in structures fashioned by sentient entities; conversely, what transpires before our eyes are irregularities indicative of nature's handiwork \u2013 shaped over eons by wind-driven erosion and dust storms that have sculpted myriad Martian features alongside this enigmatic visage.\n\nFurthermore, granular topographic data acquired from these orbital vehicles elucidate that the Face forms part of Cydonia Mensae \u2013 an expanse replete with kindred formations sharing analogous attributes. Characterized by mesas and buttes arising from erosive processes compounded with sedimentary accretions typical on planetary surfaces\u2014this array mirrors similarities with its countenanced counterpart hinting at shared origins molded through geological epochs rather than intentional machinations.\n\nA pivotal strand in unraveling this mystery unfurls through spectral examinations encircling this ancient formation. Discerning analyses reveal rock compositions within Cydonia Mensae akin to prevalent Martian lithologies found across diverse locales. Were extraterrestrial entities responsible for such craftsmanship, one would anticipate unearthly constituents or materials devoid on Martian terrain; conspicuously absent amidst scrutinizing probes.\n\nIn summation, while it may appeal to some to entertain more fanciful narratives regarding phenomena akin to Mars' portrait-like feature\u2014a discerning perusal underpins unequivocally nature's artistry shaped gradually through geological metamorphoses over time.",

        "I'll help rewrite the text while maintaining the skeptical and personal tone of the reference text about driverless cars. Here's the rewritten version:\n\nI dont agree with joining the Seagoing Cowboys program becuase my first thought when I hear about it is safety concerns. Thats my main worry; being safe on these ships. If youre crossing entire oceans, so many things could go wrong with the boat or the weather could turn bad. The ship could hit rough waters and the animals could get loose, causing accidents or getting someone hurt. In the article they talk about all these special skills you need, like handling livestock and understanding maritime operations. If you ask me this sounds more like training to be an astronaut than helping with farm animals. They tested this program with inexperienced volunteers, thats not safe. Plus they mention the huge costs involved. Who has that kind of money to spend on traveling across oceans?\n\nThey say that these cowboys arent really independent, they still need supervision from experienced crew members all the time. So whats the point of calling it the Seagoing Cowboys if youre not really in charge? Even Luke mentions having to rely on others for basic tasks. I would rather just work on a regular farm. Speaking of these programs, fancy organizations like UNRRA and other relief agencies are running similar programs. If this program is as great as they say then why is it so exclusive and hard to get into? Not everyone can afford to take months off work to volunteer, only people with plenty of money and time can do this.\n\nWhen i hear \"Seagoing Cowboys\" i think of freely riding across the ocean helping animals. This article says volunteers must follow strict rules and be ready for supervisors to take over whenever needed.\n\nIn conclusion i think the Seagoing Cowboys program is pointless because youre not really independent, it requires too much training, special equipment, and supervision. Its expensive and theres probably better ways to help communities rebuild. So if you ask me volunteering as a Seagoing Cowboy is not my thing.",

        "As a scientist at NASA, I am in pursuit of unraveling the enigmas of the cosmos constantly, and I often find myself engaged in conversations about purported extraterrestrial happenings. Among these, the so-called Face on Mars has long fascinated those who are convinced it was painstakingly constructed by alien beings. But it becomes evident that there are strong rationales to uphold the idea that this formation is nothing more than a natural geological feature after a thorough perusal of the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars'.\n\nGeological specialists have carried out in-depth examinations of the images of the Face on Mars. Their findings strongly suggest that the similarity to a human visage is nothing but a matter of chance. The unique way sunlight hits particular ridges on the Martian surface generates optical illusions. These illusions are what make the formation seem strikingly like a face, effectively disproving any assertions of intentional creation. For example, when the sun is at a certain angle during the Martian day, the shadows cast by the uneven terrain blend in a way that mimics the contours of a human face, but it's all a trick of light and shadow.\n\nMoreover, high-resolution imaging technology has been a game-changer in our understanding of the Martian landscape. It has offered us a detailed look into the erosion mechanisms at play on Mars.",
